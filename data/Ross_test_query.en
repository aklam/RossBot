Yeah but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here.
Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.
Wow!
everybody we know? Yeah.
Are you Joey?
No, you cannot.
What?
You got it!
If you hadn't just had a baby with my best friend I swear to Lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your danglers RIGHT NOW!
Ross, what 's the big deal? So I kissed the guy!
Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.
Yeah, he's the handy man. He's gonna be retiring next week and everyone who lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of thing.
We're looking into it.
It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
Sex in his chair.
Uh-huh.
Love what you've done with the place.
Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together.
I am not wrong.
What?
What?
Okayyyyy, open up!
You seem to really like her.
Well you 're not gonna be able to keep doing this.
Oh, thanks, sweetie.
I don't see why not.
No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.
Yeah, sorry boys, this ride's closing.
I have an audition, but I 'll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?
Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.
Well that's not a third nipple.
So, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?
Ross!
Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time.
Yeah. I felt a little weird about it. You're a teacher. I'm a student. But would you maybe want to go out with me sometime?
Picturing that tree?
And the destination?
I 'm fine, I'm fine.
Thank you! Thank you!
Yes, you're having a boy!
Okay. Wait! Wait!
Ooh, it's not a toy.
Oh, but of course it is!
She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.
So, so, did you hear?
Open it! Open it! Open it!
From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
Oh no-no, I 'm fascinated by paleontology. Have you read the new Walter Alvarez book?
its Mike Hanagen
Not once.
Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could-  -I'd want yours.
And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
Who are those people?
Where's my underwear?!
Later!
Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.
Seriously?
Where 'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
Hey!
Hey!  How 's it going?
Just once!
How could you have kept all of this from me?
Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.
I'm just saying, I have a cabin in the Adirondacks if you ever want to get away from the city, well, that'd be  just nifty!
Exellent dream score.
Sorry.
Your cappucino sir.
Oh! Me too!
Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.
Alright, let's take this outside.
All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!
Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good.
Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?
A meatball Sub? Thanks!
Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute!
Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'
Hey, what's going on?
Ooh.
That 's right, still no baby!  Come on people! Please make some room!
No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god.
Yeah. That's me!
Hi!
Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.
Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.
You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?
Yeah, and I'm so, so sorry, Ross, I'm sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat.  I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have have a great one!
Oh umm, y 'know I think it would be better if we just save it.
Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now!  Oh, thank you!
Can you hold on a moment? I have another call.  I love her.
Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones!
You wanna return this couch?  It's cut in half!
Do you always have to bring him here?
Hi.
Isn 't it a beautiful wedding?!
Life partner.
Y'know Ross why don 't you put that on your answering machine!
No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means  "you're gonna get eaten by a bear".
I think she 's checking out your beehive Ross.
Is your finger caught in that chair?
Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.
Okay.
Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned.
Wiener, Wiener  Wiener, Wiener!!!
Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?
My brother, Ross.
Here's your scone.
No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.
' I drink tea. '
Texas?
Where's Monica?
Right.
What 's up?
OK.
Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that 's okay.
Ah.  Slow swimmers?
Oh God!
Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.
Right.
What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
I don 't know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other
Are you wearing my glasses?
Might wanna open with the snowman.
Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.
were you this irritating?
Uh, I'm a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation
Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
I just want you to know.. Last night.. I'll never forget it.
Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?
That's funny. Who are they?
Sting 's son, seven years old and there's a picture.
No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here is the puncture wound from your ring.
You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!
If she 's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
-Peaches?
Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.
No! All he 's thinking about is how you're taking this! I mean, listen it's totally freaking him out. He's talking about moving to Vermont.
Then don't touch one!!
Yeah, right. Look at you, you 're practically giddy.
I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my...
Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.
C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.
Come on! Why are we here?!
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
Well, y 'know he lost his keys so he was looking for them
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You 're not Elizabeth's dad?!
Oh. Oh, it 's beautiful. I see it now.
That's great!
You really should have been more clear about that!
Yeah, y 'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella.  So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!
One.
Hello.
No! No-no they 're not. They're still very angry! But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
Ross!
Oh, it 's so great to see you feeling like this!
How can I help you?
No! No, of course not. No. That 's why I brought it up.  They didn't have any sodas?
Hi! Hi. Hi, Rachel!  What's she doing here?
That 's great. I worry about little Ross. He's always reading, he's collecting rocks and he's obsessed with dinosaurs.
Look, you guys have been to every play I 've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
Come on, Ross, that didn 't mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.
So what 's going on with you?
What that woman... did. I am not doin ' that. It's just gonna have to stay in, that's all, everything will be the same, it'll just stay in.
Thank you.  Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there 's no turning back.
Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.
Hey, Pheebs! Hi!
Yeah, it 's a very large plane.
Then free as a bird. What 's up?
So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you 're doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.
Ooooh! Freeze him out.
You have to get a ticket to get past security.
I think we gotta end the freeze out.
Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!
You don't.
What is going on?
Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
You two are really gonna enjoy that couch.
No, it was just the three of us.
Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing?
All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
Hey.
Yes!  Y-E-S. Yes!
I'll ask.  Boohaki?
I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know!
Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.
Do we have to tell her?
Yeah, everything 's fine!
Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?
Ohhh.
Yeah...
My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Oh yeah, no, what 's that?
I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.
That sounds like my first bike.  My dad gave me his old one.
Sorry.
Right.
Thanks!
I'm sorry.
Little bit.
Yeah! Yeah, sort of. I 'm sorry.
Yeah?
Oh no.
Well I got stuff going on in here  if you wanna feel.
Coffee.
He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it...
He didn 't ask me to marry him.
Okay, we're on it. We're on it.
Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.
Seriously. What?!
Ross, you're like my best friend.
Because! She 's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me.
Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.
Good!
Oh that 's a nickname we were trying out.
Well I love you too.
Okay, who 's next?!
Cool!
Oh, Ross...
No! No, she 's-She was nice. I mean, she's a little slutty, but who isn't?
Wow, excuse me, sir, do you have a boarding pass?
I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
What're you guys doing out here?
Does it?
What about the rest of Manhattan?!
Uh, that's our friend Tanya.
Ahh, I don 't believe you. I think you don't want them to see you begging me.
OK, listen I 've been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It's a show, but we're just dancing, OK? It's no big deal. The important thing to remember - stay cool.
Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!
I got no sleep last night!
I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you!  I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Morning.
Hey!
You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.
But Ross, I 'm such having a great time! Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make- believe tea parties.
Does it still hurt?
Did I go to this school?
One more time from the top... I like big butts and I cannot lie, you other br...
Oh God!
Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage.
Do I know why we 're rushing?
What is it?
No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.
Oh.
Hi!
Ross, what're you doing.
Hi!
Hi.
Nooo, I said we needed a new plan.
No no no, no no no, neat, as in no rocks.
No, actually, see I had to pee, 'cause I can't use public bathrooms because the doodie parasites.
Like a date type  person?
What 'd I get?
OH.....MY.....GAWD!!
Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
Shhh! I want to hear the rest!
Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!
Hi.
No! I 'm putting that in my room.
What are the odds? What are the odds?
Hey.
Oh my God!
I say push her down the stairs.
But y 'know what, if you think it's gonna be okay we'll just work out a system. Y'know, it'll be like college, I'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, "Come back later, I'm gettin' lucky."
Maybe they do. I've been doin' this ten years and I haven't gotten anywhere. There's gotta be a reason.
Want us to go?
Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us.
Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?
All right. When is, when is the next flight out?
If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can.
Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.
So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win, remember?
Oh no Dr. Long, please come in. This is Ross, he is the father.
I 'm not on the list!
Hey.
I did.
No, we haven't seen her since this morning.
No
Ah, poke  a  nose, mmm
But you didn 't give it to her?
You 're going down.
Oh I do!  Oh, y 'know what? No.  Wait a second.  I know it's in here somewhere.
What if I smack my head on the concrete?
Oh, that was our favourite game show ever!
And you know Monica and Ross!
I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.
I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left.
Sorry.
Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.
This game makes no sense!
Okay, bye!!
All right.
All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid.
That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever.
Yeah, umm that 's Whitney , Kyle's ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y'know divert her so that we can slip out?
Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!
Oh hi. It's, it's Mark.
You are undressing very quickly.
Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it 's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle.
And, by the way, I really enjoyed your paper on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis.
Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah!
I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.
You 'd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?
All right.  Okay, here we go!
Yes. Yes! Please, come in.
You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.
Yeah! Yes!
Don't do that to yourself. Any one of us could have tripped over that little girls jump-rope.
Hey!
Cut it out.
Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!
Are you ok, Ross?
Aren't you gonna...
No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable.
No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.
Your thumb? That 's weird.  You sure you're punching right? Make a fist.  Maybe later. Ross I feel terrible.
Okay, Santa!
Well, they 're just gonna have to wait aren't they? I've only got two hands!!
Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?
No.
Neat.
Hey sweetie!
Hey!
Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.
I will think about it.
Hi. And batting for Sarah, Ross Geller, 872. Although, it looks like you bought an awful lot of cookies yourself.
Let her know I like her? What are you, insane?  It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem?  I'm right, right?
Ohh that 's so sweet!  Oh! Hang on!  Hang onnnnnn!!!   Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0, it's a number! It comes after 4-9!! No, it's okay. It's okay, you're allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired.
Third one from the left?
You really think so?
Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
Oh my God!!
Oh we just -we drove each other crazy!
You really like it?
She you in the parking lot.
What the hell was that?!
Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say,  "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
What? What is it?
What?
No, you know what, I think you should go.
Uh-hmm.
C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.
Hey!
Oh, it's perfect!
Well, there you go!
How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?
Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died.
Okay, but if you can't no dinner!
Sure!
Ohh, okay, I 'm sorry. You're right. Y'know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you 're asking of me.
Okay, you ready for the last picture?
Yeah? Really? No one 's home?
I know!
Wh-what's that?
Oh, but it 's made her so happy.
I cannot believe you.
Yeah.
Maybe. Joey
I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?
Thanks.
See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!
I need to talk to you, it 's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.
What the hell!!!
Oh, she 's got you running errands, y'know, picking up wedding dresses  Wah-pah!
Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
I care!
So, uh, how was your day?
I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy.
Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I 've ever gotten.
I stole Monica 's and changed the name.
Well maybe you can cut me some slack. I 'm sort of in love.
She's in her room, why?
Well if-if that 's what it is, then it's-it's crazy.
No, I 'm fine.
What about it?
I've been following your career for years, I-I can't wait for your keynote speech.
Well, why are you doing this anyway?
Pretty much.
Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding.
Oh yeah!
Oh! My number is on there.  Give me a call.
Really? You can actually see it?
Or... Dick.
Hey, what have you guys been up too?
I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant.
No
OOOOOHHHHH!
The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.
What?
Oh, they said uh,  "You don't have insurance here, so stop calling us."
Well, call me!
Just hear me out!
Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.
What do we do? What do we do?
Oh. Why didn 't you take her?
I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y 'know? And it's probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn 't be a secret, and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.
Come on you gotta have one!
So hi!
Well just ask Mona to give it back!
You okay man?
Okay.
I felt it!
Hi Ross!
That didn 't work on mom, it's not going to work on us.
Come on!
Sure, what do you want to see?
My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!
Okay.  Oh man, I swear if they sold these at Pottery Barn
Come here, check this out!
You're gonna kill me!
Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane.
This is so much fun!
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You 're not talking about Chuckles University?!
Emily.
Oh, okay, we 're going. Yeah.
The exclamation point in the title scares me.  Y'know, it's not just Freud , it's Freud!
What?
Just think about it. If you don't, I'll talk more about humping.
You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn 't even fit you anymore!
Well, just wake him up!
Yeah!
Shh. Shh. Don 't try to talk, we'll get you up to your room, we'll soak your feet, you'll be okay.
uh huh  how do I look
Yesss!!

Bet she'd sleep with you now...
Okay, listen Robert...
Yeah, but so is this.
Yes he was.
Phoebe and I are moving in together.
Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
The reason we haven 't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
Oh believe me, Ross, I won't be telling anybody about this.
Oh, this is such a cute picture of Emma. And is this your son... or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation?
Oh my God! Calling from Rome!  Bon giorno, caro mio.
Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!
It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
Ross and Emily have made their declarations and it gives me great pleasure to declare them husband and wife.
Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!
Excuse me?
How do you figure that?
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
Thanks for having me over, you guys.
Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?
Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman.
Does a dog's lips move when he reads?  Okay, no they don't.
All right, I 'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's.
What 's the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler's!
You okay there, slugger?
You can watch our tape if you want.
That 's true. You do have another child.
Hey.
Y'know Marcel?
Is she in there?
So that 's two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.
Here you go.
Um, coffee to go, please.
What?
You don't have to seem so happy about it.
Well, I think it all started when you said,  "Hey Joey, why don't you be my best man."
The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
Are you kidding me, I could stay and look at her forever.
Oww!
I 'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
OOH! God! Sorry!
Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.
Thank you! So, did-did he get it?
Bye!
Ezel.
I don 't know.
I studied for a year in Barcelona.
I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin ' with you too!
Well, you 're practically dancing already. Why don't you just do it over here?
Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
Well, I 've just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn't have naked chicks on it.
Phoebe, that 's huge!
Ok honey, you really need a job.
Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, I 've attended some of the finest medical schools in Central America. Well then, let's take a look at this skin abnormality of yours.  Come on, have a seat.  Eeh, huh. As I suspected, it's a koondis!
We are aware of the problem you are referring too.  But as far as increasing security, I 'm afraid the library is very understaffed. I, I can't help you.
Caitlin!
No. Why?
She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.
Well put it back.
Nooo, he 's leaving for a better job.
Oh, you haven't picked yet. Oh good, 'cause I had an idea. I thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog. Chappy.
I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.
Joey.
Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?
Yeah.
How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?
Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.
Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?
Yes.
What?!
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker.
Gimme the keys!
You know it was you're uhm... birthday...
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
You must be Ross.
You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it 's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!
Oh, y'know, it 's just like hats, and a shirt, and CD's, just sort of stuff that you've left here.
Hey!
Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!
Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!
Fancy guest.
Because you 've only known her for six weeks! Okay, I've got a carton of milk in my fridge I've had a longer relationship with!
Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on  "Days" I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
Op! We gotta go!
What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman.
Yes, you can, very much.
Cassie needs to stay at your place.
Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.
Thanks daddy.
Are you really not going?
Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk?  Hey, Joey?
Yeah, the stripper stole it.
It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.
Oh, that 's better then.
Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple?
We 're not gonna lose to girls.
Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I 'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
Yeah?
I-I already told him everything!  You shush!!
Oops! All right, so what do you want to do now?
Okay Ross, we 're-wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.
Are you serious?!
I guess.
I don't have a page.
Hey!
So .
I know, I know, I'm sorry-
It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.
I can 't believe you're not picking me.
1200.
Okay.
Ross!
All right. . He is a good guy. You're right, he wouldn't cheat.
Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He 's the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.
Yeah bye-bye!  Hey! So just a light layer?
Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase,  'Hummina-hummina-hummina.'
What?!
I don 't know.
I think face to face.
I'm parked in a garage on Morton!
Oh, hmm.
Oo! When 's her birthday?!
I don't know, it's just
No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play.  When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity.  Thank you! La la la la la la la....
Thanks!
Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?
No! Never! Never!  Bye.
Score.
Take thee, EM-I-LY
Who's Nancy?
Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring?
No you guys
Okay, I 'll just put a little more booze on there.
Mmh... he does have a pretty serious latex fetish.
Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!
Well, I 'm miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!
A scooter!
Hey guys!
Umm, I-I thought we were moving forward and now you 're-you're sending me all these mixed signals. What are you trying to tell me?
Thank you. Is that one of my cigarettes?
Oh my God! Are you serious?!
Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesn't matter, because I can't do anything about it.
What thing? What is this thing?
Really?
Isn 't that great?
Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union of Ross and Emily.  Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross...
Anytime you're ready.
Oh wait, don 't you have to pay for your,  Busty Ladies?
Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
Ross!
May I see it?
What?
Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?
Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....
Yes! Did you see that?
Why?
I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded. And there were tall trees all around.  It was dead silent. Gorgeous.  And across the lake I saw a beautiful woman bathing herself but she was crying
Chandler.
Bye-bye!  That 's why I moved out.
Honey, I'm sorry.
I meant with my son.
Are you serious?!
So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we 're 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we've-we've already slept together so y'know there'll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, "What's that?!"
I bet 20.
Oh, Chandler that is so nice.
That 's so sweet.  Would you like to come in and say good-bye? I'm sure it would mean a lot to her.
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
Oh Ross, hi.
Ross, she 's not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.
Hi!
Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
You 're still gonna go out with her?!
What, what are they talking about?
Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump...
So you want to come inside?
What kind of smell?
Get my glasses too.
Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.
Hi! Hi! You 're crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
That is the sweetest thing, I just....
Oh. Oh wait no.
Rachel.
Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.
That 's so great for you guys!
Wow!
Yeah, I can see where I 'd be your best shot but, no. I'm sorry, but I think it's twisted.
If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.
I'm the hell person whose office this is!
Art it is.
Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. . .
Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can 't get out of!
Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what?
So Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?
Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren 't wearing underpants?
I did.
I'm sure he was just joking, Ross.
No, Joey!
Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?
Alrighty. We're gonna start with some basic third stage breathing exercises, so Mummies, why don't you get on your back? And... coaches, you should be supporting Mummy's head.
Wow. That is not a happy hi.
Only if you say his full name.
OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.
Yeah I think so.
I can 't. Please, you do it for me.
It sounds interesting!
I got off the plane.
Hi.
Now, are you sure you don 't want to go see a doctor?
Oh, yeah, I don 't know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.
WHAT?
Didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs? My fianc e was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner.
Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something.  What?   You slept with someone else?!
I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
Oh good! Because we have an  "I'm sorry" song.
taking a long walk, and then there's the one that's proved most effective
Is that why your hand is pressed against my crotch?
Alright, Emma is napping...  what happened to your shirt?
Yeah, yeah. Phoebe and I are going to have so much fun. And thank you for watching the baby, by the way.
Yeah?
Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..
Now go!
You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?
Yeah it is! It is! It 's freshwater eel!
I wish I could know if you 'd heard any of that. I suppose I've either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if you're listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there's not much chance you did heard that, and there's the call waiting so, I should go. Oh well.  Hello.
3-B!
No, the other thing. I really think it 's great they work things out.
No.
What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?
Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.
Yes you can! Sting says so himself!
Dude! He's right there!
Ok.  Thank you for coming with me today.
That new mountain bike?
You're right, I apologize. Scratch the last question. Spell "Boscodictiasaur".
What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
I don 't know.
Oh good.
Yeah.
What, what!? it's for her hot friends!
I don 't want to talk about it.
Six.
Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
Hi.
Phoebe.
Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.
Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you.
Just one cheek.
HI!
Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don 't see that everyday, do ya?
Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with.
That's because I'm pregnant!
What?
Uh-huh, yeah that 's too bad. I really want to go to his concert Friday night, but it's totally sold out. I know! Why don't you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two I'll take you.
I'm telling ya...  I can do it.
I can 't do that either! The soles' are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.
And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn 't wear a cup.
That 's like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!
I set her up with this actor on my show.
Ok.
Really?
Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?
She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
Are you sure?
From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'
It's uh, $12.50.
Word on the street - well, when I say street, I mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo.
You, you are gonna love this.
Y 'know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?
Alright!
Yes.
Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
It's great. You're gonna be the hit of the conference.
Fine, I will.
You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
Yes!
Oh my God!  I'm your groupie!
Yeah!!
See? I've even called Animal Control!
Well, I can't help you.
No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die.
You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
That 's not so good.
We are on a roll, people!!
Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really I don't mind.
Hey, mister tux!
Okay, I 'll see you in our room.
Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
Fear of Triscuts?
All right, all right.
Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I 'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy. But, I don't know, I'm not to worried about it.
Was that place... The Sun?
You know?!
No don't worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally over Eric.
No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?
Hi, darling. Where's my grandson, you didn't bring him?
Hey.
Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!
Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.
Yeah, I
Oh, I love your neighborhood. There 's a great gym right around the corner from your building.
Please tell me you 're not gonna dress up like a dinosaur.
Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses.
I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.
Excuse me?
Let me try it on!
I'm just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.
Well it stupid, unfair question!
Yes, please.
Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!
Are you crazy?
Hey
Could you do me one favor, if it 's not too much trouble?
You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you.
Really?!
You really enjoyed yourself didn 't you?
Okay, our news. My company has asked me to head up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated.
I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars.
Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross.
What?
Hey guys!
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
She is unbelievable, our mother is...
Who 's cell phone is that? It's just so annoying; everywhere you go.
Well, up yours too!
Ok, Ross, what's going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?
Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I 'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...
Uhh, 11!
I'm sorry, I didn't get... Susan is?
What 's going on?
That sounds great.
Surprised?
No, I 'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him.
Oh my God!
see I can't decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.
Good luck.
Could you tell Jasmine that I won't make it to yoga class today?
We agreed on Minnie.
I'm not scared.  I'll just take little Chappy and...  HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.
Where've you been?
Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores.  You know, we as a group are not the coolest.
I can too eat by myself!
Yeah, thanks. You know what?
Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
Hey! Oh!
What's so bad about that?
Chicken Kiev?
That 's my car!
Hi!
Yeah.
OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.
Yeah!
Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.
Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?
That's so sweet.
Really?
Hey! The law says you have to accept any fare.
I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.
Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I 'd be serving him sneezers.
Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm.
I just finished getting Phoebe all dressed to meet Mike's parents. She's so nervous, it's so sweet!
I think on some levels she already knows.
I'm not supposed to tell you.
Because I 'm in love with you.
Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out
Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! . I mean, this is just beautiful!
Veto. Sawyer?
Give us a kiss. Come on! Come on!
Oh... I'm back!
Hey.
Okay, you 'd tell me the truth. Right?
Well, I 'm going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um......
I don 't know, but we're having dinner tomorrow night, so I figured, she's gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to, buy me presents, I don't know! So, you're all bored?
Santa has reindeers that can fly!
Bye.
Really?! Well see? I never knew about her.
That is so unfair!
You know, I had a chance to stop her too!
I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?
You know the song! Sing along!
Thank you! I know, though.
Ross!
No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front.  So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.
Sit down!
Ah!
But y 'know what? It just seems that you two belong together.
He does that?!
That-that you came on to me?
Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I 'm never gonna find anything.
Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it 's better if we're on the same team.
How is  "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?
Really?
I 'm Rhonda,  and these aren't real!
Oh! That's great!
Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?
Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don 't want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking, "Ah, I'll get over this." Y'know? I just-It just keeps gettin' harder. I don't, I don't know what to do. Y'know? What do I do?
You 've have lipstick right here . That's okay, it's mine, we just kissed.
I couldn 't help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look! (He goes to punch Ross, expecting him to duck, but he doesn't and Joey punches Ross.
I don 't wanna hear "Three failed marriages!"
You've never turned?
Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that 's he's going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff.
Hey!
Fine with me.
Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
But the audition 's in a couple hours and I don't even understand the game.
Of course they're gonna say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity. It's all a great big cover-up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?
Come on. I'll let you lead.
Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?
Fine. Fine, but I 'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want!
Wait, what am I gonna do?
Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding!
It 's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.
So? What? What? They 're gone! Monica's gonna freak!
Really?
Peter Parker.
Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldn 't be the worst thing in the world.
Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
I-I think everybody 's pretending they don't hear you. Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it!  Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I saved you seat.
Hey.
Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.
It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost- cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.
Other wall, people! Other wall!
Hey!
Yeah?
Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!
You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?
Mine!
Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught me Hot- cross Buns.
So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.
I can 't remember which sister.
Alright. Just keep him away from me.
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
Hey!
Ross, you did not come up with "got milk?"
Oh, okay. Alright, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8
Yes?
I think it makes you look really dangerous.
Gimme an  'M!'
Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.
Wow. Umm Huh I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
There's no room under the bed.
Hey!
What?! All right -Hey! Don't look at me! You're the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet!
What are you talking about Pheebs?  I don't   Oh my God, you drew on me?!
Ross, I 'm gonna go.
Thanks man.
Oh, it was so much fun. It felt so good to be out.
Fresh!
Okay.
Oh, he has a gig. I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know. My husband has a gig.
God Ross, what is that?
Uh, that 's okay. You can dance with her first.
Oh, hey, man I know, doesn 't matter how much we love 'em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.
Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don 't need that kind've hurt. Take it from a guy who's never had a long term relationship......
Mmmm!
Okay that 's it. I give up. At mom and dad's 40th anniversary, you're the one giving the speech.
Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.
You are so sweet.
What's wrong buddy?
Hello-dillillio!!
Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi.
Ross.
Okay.   "It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out." Ross
Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
Wow. What can I say?  This doesn 't make me like you any better!
Whoa!!
Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.
Just keep smiling.
Hey.
All right!
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
Yeah, the list that -of people we're allowed to sleep
Don 't be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y'know? Mine's gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.
Okay. Have a benefit.
All right.
You didn 't just break up.
Which I may say, right now, is out of control.
Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo 's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her.
All right let me see.  Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel?
Uh yes, heroin and crack.
With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?
You gotta do it, man.
Ah, did I leave the stove on?
Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!
Hey.
Yeah. All right, I 'll talk to you later.
... in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.  Thank you!
Professor Geller?
Did I say garage? I meant garbage.
By the way, that fight was totally arousing.
Dude, don't do that too me!
Oh no.
Wait-wait! You 're umm, you're a potato
Yeah! All right, I 'll see you guys later.
Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.
I know, yeah, sorry.
What?!
Limited seating?!  I am just one tiny person!
I'm not going along with some lie you made Ross, No I'm just gonna be honest with him.
Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh, maybe going back to my place for um, dessert.
Help!
Oh wow! So, you 're more than just dinosaurs.
Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she 's gonna know.
Y'know what umm, actually I, I really, I should go.
I know!
Sting has a son that goes there too!
Okay,  fine. Come dinosaur, we 're not welcome in the house of no imagination.
Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first.
Ohhh!!!!
Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
Hey.
Oh! No, not really.
Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters.
Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one 's free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free.
Oh man!
Why not?!
Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?
HI!! Hi!
What's with you?
Yeah.
No.
I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.
Wellll?
Ah-haah! I win!!
This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?
No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people still die. And, you can put candy in it.
Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . .
Oh, okay, I get it.
Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?
Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
Wait, are you leaving?
Faster! You 're not going fast enough!
A sandwich?
Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
Yes.
Did you get the grant?
Thank you. Can you believe no-one between my apartment and here offered to do that for me?
Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?
Hey!
And you never knew she was a lesbian...
Ross, we haven 't done the routine since middle school.
Good! Good, long time no see.
Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable?
No!  Shhh!
Okay.
Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
What happened you guys?
I missed you, too! So, how was your week?
What?
Oh-oh! So that 's the way it's gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y'know!
... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend Billy.
Yeah, I actually don 't know...
No, no, you don't have to see.
Guys, you're not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight to Emma and she said her first words!!
Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me!  Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!
Hi!
Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.
What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.
You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?
Honey.
Congratulations on the baby, and on the wedding
G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!
That proposal, at the planetarium
Joey, do you have a minute?
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer...
It's throwing and catching!
Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you.
What?
What?
No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
Do you not want to be seen with me?
Oh! I'm sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?
Oh! You know, I just... couple of things I tried ... I just sang a little doo... Itsy Bitsy Spider...
I still can 't believe it! I'm the luckiest guy in the world!
Honestly! Ross, this isn 't just some girl you picked up in a bar and humped. A child should have a family.
We've got a cab waiting downstairs.
Uhh, uh...
Still going through that dry spell with Carol?
You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying,  "Rachel!"
Oh my God! Did you talk to him?
Hey, you don 't have to smile. You just have to dance.
No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
So what are they doing?
Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.
Whoa! What?! Why?!
Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn 't the play still going.
Why don 't you go up on stage. I'll get a picture of you doing the speech.
You didn 't tell anybody I was did you?!
Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.
I said I didn 't technically.
I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
I 'm going for a walk.
So, as Joey 's friends, is there anything that you guys think our readers ought to know?
Okay. Just give us a second. Ross!
Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn't look so bright.
All right, give it back to me.  5 of hearts.
Okay.
Yeah?
OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.
What? Wait, what?
I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
Lights please? And that's having a baby. Next week is our final class.
Personal thing? What personal thing? I don 't know.
I didn 't uh, really have time to read this part of the books, but do you think we have time to
Where have you been?
Yeah.
Hi honey.
Hey! It 's starting to snow.
Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.
Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross 's points!
Well, I don 't care about the divorces either, but I wouldn't date him. It's just that he's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.
Okay.
Well, this is awkward. {See? I told you so.}
Whoooaa!
No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
Yeah...
Oh.
Yeah, I know.
Well, it 's just y'know that something like this would never to like The Hulk, y'know
Oh, I like Elizabeth.
Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle.
Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.
Then what's gonna happen?
You can totally tell! Here look, watch me.  Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown.  Smile!
Uh Look Rach  Hey Ross is here! Hey look! It's my good friend Ross. Hey Ross.
Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish.
I don 't want you to date her!
It 's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right?
No actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas.
Oh yeah. That 's a great story.
Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt.
Phoebe, if this guy 's going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him?
Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.
Carol, not me.
I bet you did!
I have an audition for this play and for some of it I have to speak French. Which, according to my resume, I'm fluent in.
That's not how you really feel is it?
Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!
Really?
How are you?
Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us, right?
Hi.
Well why not you changed Ned 's grade!
So, except for the fermentation process, beer and ale are basically the same thing. Fascinating isn't it.
I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash.  So-so what I am saying is - is is that  is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!
Monica.
Well, I just caught the live show.
What?!
Hello.
What?
Yeah! I 'm just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends.
You are mad!
Nothing, I don 't know.
Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me?
Phoebe! We 're both  your backup?!
Six? You want me to join you?
And slept with the professor.
But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that.
It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
What?
Ross, what is taking you so long?
W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
Great! All right. I 'll see you later.
Okay, well can 't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags!
Am I going to let you watch me undress?
Really?
Yeah, all right.
What?
Who 's number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
Who are these men?
Look, I 'm fine. Watch.  Look at that.  Whoa-whoa!
Check.
Not that big a deal? There there was touching of things.
Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is  gay.
No.
Don't you just love it?
We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
Oh my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pajmena could be a rug!
No.
I'm going commando, too.
We love you, man.
Oh wow, this feels weird.
Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?
Huh, I might be losing interest in this.
Do I look fat?
In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepard.
Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
Okay everyone, think thick.
Kyle 's ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date her!
The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya?
Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
Wait up!
What 's happening to your accent?
Okay, the next situation is for Rachel. The wedding is about to start you walk into the back room and you find Monica taking a nap with Ross.  I 'll be Monica. Go!
Chandler?
Yeah, sure.
Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about. We taught her well. Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go?
Ahh, nooo!!
All right!
Oh my God.
Or we could throw you both in now!
You too sweethart!
Okay.
I'm getting my cigarettes out of my jacket.
'Okay.  Okay, daddy we'll see you tomorrow night.  Okay bye-bye.'
I don 't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
That thing is not coming in here.
No, so I don 't have to get married until I'm 33! That's three years, that's three whole years-Oh, wait a minute though. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty.
Give it!
Hey it 's Mona! From the wedding.
Okay.
Hi!
She spit up. Judy! She spi Judy! Look alive, Judy!  Thank you.
And I won!
Like?
Ross, wait!
Okay.
Oh, my.
...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
Noo! Maybe! I, I don 't know. Ross, I still can't forgive you for what you did, I can't, I just, but sometimes when I'm with you I just, I feel so...
Oh, here is your beautiful baby. Congratulations!
131!
Ooh! Tough odds!
Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey!  Gotcha.
They made you head of the department!
I 'll take that bet.
Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.
Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.
You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush. I'm just saying, it's right there.
Right and then everybody finds out and they're like
Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!
Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that 's not happening 'til October 15th, 2032.
You don't think we should wait for him?
Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?
Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross?
I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so.... romantic.
We 'll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!
Well that 's ambitious.
What are you shushing?
Monica.
Yeah! That was so weird, huh?
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?
Okay.
You're blowin' me off for a monkey?
I want to do it again.
Sure, it 's hard to forget! But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about.
Come on Ross! I 'm miserable here! Come on! You started this, now you finish it! Come on wuss, make love to me.
Oh, give it to me.
You slept with another woman?
Hope you had a nice flight.
Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won 't get spit in the eyes, y'know?
Happy New Year.
Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?
Well, I feel fine, but I think you 're bumming out the rest of the kids.
Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.
We 're beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....
Hey!
There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!
Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has -yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates.
Uh, I think she's still asleep. Hey, hey, how did it go with you guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you.
Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.
Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.
Okay, let 's do it. I'll move in.
Oh, hey, don 't forget your shirt.
Yes, she jumped right back up.
Look, it 's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.
It's my joke.
Ross, there is absolutely no way this is going to come off unless you start to
No. He.....he 's coming out of his shorts.
Not even with your best friend.
What?! Are you kidding?!
No, yeah, I've done that.
I 'll be back in ten minutes.
Oh no, wait! Joey!
That could be it.
Yeah.
I got a gig!
Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
Wow. Ok.
Yeah.
Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
Well, what did the police say?
Um, everyone?
Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!
Ohhhh! These seats are great!
Nobody.
Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!
Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here!
What?! You 're going out with her again!
Hello? Yeah, um. Hang on one sec.  <to Ross and Rachel> Can I take this upstairs?
What!? They are totally ripping us off!
Is your back feeling better?
Okay, we owe you a present.
Sure, May...tember.
All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?
Monica 's gotta have the phone in the right place and-
Sort of.
Wow that 's actually pretty cool.
All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
Sandy, that's exactly what it is...
So, anyone up for a midnight dip in the ocean?
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but I 'm okay.
Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.
I know, I know. I went a little crazy.
Fine! Do you want something to drink?
You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
No, I don't mind you touching my belly, but right now your hand is kind of blocking the part where the baby is gonna come out.
And also, congratulations on your wedding.
Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?
Well... there is just one small... stipulation...
What uh-oh?
Sure, he was in your "band"?
Yeah, I 've been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my Grandma's.
Grape.
Goodnight.
Oh, we 're not together.
Nice!
Okay, here we go.
How come?!
Ross? Ross?
And, and!
Besides tampons and salt?  Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you.  That's weird...it's empty!
Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
Thank you.
Apology accepted.
Well it 's kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he's not real.
No, I don 't see it!
Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast here. Thank you.  I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel...
Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!
No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing- there team.
Oh Ross you 're so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax
Sure!
What?!
Nah. Not really.
Hey!
Oohhh.
That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.
Come on!
You guys okay?
Yeah well we should order some food then.
Hey, check this out! It's totally you!
Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!
He carries a briefcase.
Hello?
We hate that guy.
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.
What in God 's name is that?!
No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.
Oh, I really could.
Touchdown!! Touchdown!!
Uh, I'm holding Ben.
...I really don't...
Okay!
Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.
Why?
All right, that's it. I want both of you out.
Oh my god.
No!
Dr. Wiener.
Oh man! Now she 's gonna start all over! We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
How hot are we?
Ooh, are you gonna do magic?
Sure, I 'll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.
You mean your pink shirt?
How about a hammer, or a small blade?
Excuse me, where are you going?
Oh yeah! What was his superpower again?
Oh well, well thank you.  Okay, stop. Stop looking at me like that. The last time that happened,  that happened.
Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl.
But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.
Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket.
Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.
Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier.
Oh, yeah.
Well, it's good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.
Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody 's sale is over?!
Thanks for dinner last night.
Right.
Bread, so you never go hungry.
Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days.
Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
What does he look like?
Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo.
Hi...
Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!
That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!
And I also got... two more apples.
What are you, what are you doin'?
Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me.
Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just...
Damn it! Rookie mistake!
That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.
Why not?!
Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good.   Yes!!   Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not.
I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.
You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me.
That won 't be necessary.
What thing? What thing?
Do you think we 'll get our three bucks back?
Okay, y 'know maybe I should come back
Wow, what-what do you think she wants?
Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem.
Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?
Didn 't she walk with a cane?
Nothing!   This is not over!
Bye hon.
Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster 's Dictionary defines marriage as  Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.
Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.
Why not?
All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn 't find out some other way.  Did you think about the trail?
Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!
Ross and Rachel's apartment. Mike is blowing a note from his beer bottle. Ross stares off to the side.)
Absolutely.
Umm, our situation. Y 'know umm, what we mean to each other. And I mean we-we're having this baby together, and we live together. Isn't that, isn't that weird?
I can't believe you did that.
Of course you did. Look Ross, you can 't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.
Come here, I'll make you a drink.
Look; you got stood up, who cares? We're gonna show you a good time. Just sit and relax. In fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on the house.
Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy...
You put your balloons down!!
Honey, it isn 't good luck.
Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...
GIVE ME MY PUCK!!
But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she 'd know I was okay.
Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!
So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.
Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that one -Dude! They're all huge!
Yeah, did I fool ya?
Ok.
What's up with the simian?
Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.
No, it's okay, you didn't know.
How cute was that?
Small...
Oh, my, oh!
So, tell me about it.
Yes, and she's very supportive.
Fine! Two minutes. Go.
The hot chicks?
Ross, don 't start.
Dude, are you okay?
Hi.
Yeah!
Yeah. Okay.
Come on, it 's a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn't smoked since.
All right!
Oh wow, I didn't get you anything. Here's five back.
Hey!
Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.
Okay, so this time I won't quit!
Together.
Yeah, I thought you knew that.
All right. I 'm gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I'm ready to have Frank and Alice's embryo transferred into my uterus.
I am freaking out!
Yeah, but you're back's a zero. You're gonna wanna even that out.
Y 'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
Okay! Okay!  I 'm so glad you're here.
Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o' clock. So I was hoping you and I could have a
I got fired.
Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
Ok!
I'm pretty sure, professor Spafford from Cornell?
We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
Here we go!
And, a lemon lime.
Funny book?
Damn it!
Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
But I already told Zelner that I would come back...
Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?
Me too.
Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!
Uh-huh.
Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
Yes?
No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us  We've been complaining the longest!
Okay, scarf 's done.
What?!
Good luck, man.
I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go!
Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?
Well, maybe he wouldn 't be she didn't bring the office home every night!
Aw, thanks!
Hey! How'd the audition go?!
Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  You'll get your turn!
Does anyone have one from a different paper? Ross, read yours.
Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
No.
It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
What? C'mon, talk to me.
I uh, I got it from the gift shop. They have really lax security there.  It 's a joke.
Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.
What about  Monica.
And I know both of them, they 're really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who's always getting chased by those big flowers
You just carry that around?
I got an extra one. You want this?
It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!
Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you 're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.
Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she 's gonna go nuts for you.
Let me put it this way. We're having sex whether you're here or not.
'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.
Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing!
Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there.
Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.
Good, you guys are all here!
He 's holding us back.
Oh, have a great wedding!
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
She's right y'know.
would you call this girl?  thanks-fo-r-a- love-ly-even-ing
I 'm not feeling it.
And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you.
Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?
Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!
Bye!
Hey, hubby!
I'm not Drake.
Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
Rossy, we're ready for you.
Yeah, don 't push it though.
Has it been that long?!
Ohhhhhhhh God.
Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.
Oh, sure!  Bye Ross!  Forever.
Great!
Yeah.
What?!
Hi sweetie! Are you leaving?
It 's true?!!
Yeah, I 'd really like to.
Ross? You okay?
I 'm a commodities broker.
Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?
Uh-hmm.
I like it.
Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.
Why is Ross doing that?
We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
Hey.
Yeah? Well you still shoulda told me.
No, wait, you don't have my phone number!
