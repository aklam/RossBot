What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?
You know, you know, actually it's getting better. It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone for Thcrabble?
Who's Richard Burke? Doc, Doctor Burke? You have a date with Doctor Burke? Why, why, why should that bother me? I, I love that man, he's like a uh, brother to dad.
Hey, thanks Rach.
I'll do it!
No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.
Oh no. Don 't, don't, don't start packing. Come on!
No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?
I don't know what I'm going to do. That date starts in like an hour.
Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you. Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here!  There are tons of freaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one will notice, I swear!
Haha! Looks like you're not going to be in the wedding either.  So sorry Pheebs.
Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
That 's right good things, that-that is what I said.
Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
Yeah, can't help but.
Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh  It's batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way!
Alright.
She said you gave her the razor!
HEY!
Which one?
Yes. Yes, yes I did.  But-but it was, it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing.
You get the dollhouse.
Yeah?
Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you scared of dogs?
What? Let me see.
Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.
Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them.
Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window.
They 're not a couple!
Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
Yeah, thanks.
Yeah, most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!
I know, it's the first time, we're leaving the baby and hey, I know how hard it is for you, but but Emma is gonna be fine. My mom is gonna be with her. She's great with kids.
'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
Well, yeah. I can 't-I can't stay here all night, and if I go in there she's-she's gonna wanna... do stuff.
Yeah, hi, I was just beeped.  No, AndrÃÃ© is not here.  Third time today.  Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services.
No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.
Well, I don 't think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that 's just because I am not emotionally unavailable!
Okay, fine, fine. You don 't want to believe me? No, that's fine.
please don't cry because of me pheebs I don't know what I'm talking about, I've been divorced three times.
Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?
Ah, actually, I 'm sorry we-we probably should get going.
Well, ??? think that's us?
Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!
Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...
No I left the diapers at the hospital! There 's some in the bag but I'll run out and get some more.
Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.
Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!
You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react?
No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous...
I am so sorry.
No, it 's not just 'cause I'm jealous.  I mean I'm not, I'm not, I'm not jealous, okay? It's Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
Pheebs, what are you doing?
Ah.
Guess whose middle name is Muriel.
Wh-What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.
Way!
I told you it wasn't long, but there is an amazing connection between us.
She's putting words in your mouth!
Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!
Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.
Cousin Frannie 's wedding, its tomorrow night.
Ohh.
Getting it away from me would be job one.
Joey come -I can't believe-I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of nature's most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
I couldn 't.
Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey 's apartment. What name appears on the address label?
Alright, ok, let's do it.  Uhm, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello!  And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic.
Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?
All the time?
Seriously... What is it?
Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I uh, you gotta have something.
'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say  "When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"
So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?
Really?
Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?
Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?
Yeah, it's really 6
Hi.
Phoebe, I
So uh, where's Monica?
Uh-huh.
Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.
No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!
That was very nice Ashley.
Uh, I'm going to take off.
Umm
My uncle Marcel.
What? What?
Oh, I'm sorry, did I say "invest it"? I meant "be cool and piss it all away"
Now, we 'll see.
Thank you!
Oh, here, I, I'll get it for ya. Whad'ya want?
Ya.
Events from around the globe.
Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.
This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!
Hi. (He is wearing a piece of steel bandaged to his nose.
Hi.
Well, last weekend
Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.
So, why is Erica coming to visit?
oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...
Huh, I'm just saying...
Hey now! That was an accident, okay.
No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.
Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you 're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job.  That's not how that was supposed to come out.
Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad.
So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?
So what! I still have -No you're probably right.
Yeah. Do you have any idea what this means in academic circles, uh? I am gonna get laid.
You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.
I mean you 're not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are ya?
She lent me an egg once.
Oh great!
I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now.
I guess!
Monica!
Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.
And what is second prize?
Hey, they 're going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y'know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful-didn't you see Personal Best?
Well, if-if she thought they were on a break
Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don't think Mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do.
You were in a porno?
So, what are you gonna do?
Y 'know what? He didn't want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don't talk to him at all!
What?
Okay, well, we 'll call the company that sent her!
She was...
My fajitas!!
Well I, close your eyes, I just think you 're gonna like this a little better, 'cause, close-close...
Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you?
Yep!
Hi, honey.
I ... I was just talking about Rachel.
Really? Well then tell it to me.
Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it 's my sister. But, uh, uh y'know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.
Great to see you!
Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn't she look cute?
Huh.
Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who 's-who's to say? Does that me we- we can't do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn't it?
Sure. Yeah.
Hmm-Hmm-Hmm.  Me, neither. I've had a really good time too, you know.

Who gets whom.  I don 't know why I do that.
Because what 's going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you.
No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset.
Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay.
What?!
What?
Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
Good-good, I 'm-I'm married.
No! No we don 't!
Bye.
Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.
Fine.
What? You - you're making money off my misery?
No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
Oh, ah, you don 't need that.
...As in Mouse?
You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me?
Yeah?
So, do you get colours or just French tips?
Okay, I'm the baby.
Kinda like a big face without skin.
Mee mee, mee-mee mee.
Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!
Oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? She... she was... eh... gay.
Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn 't invite her?
What?
Argh!
You think?
Yeah.
Well, can I talk to you for a sec.?
I didn't order lemonade.
Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.
What?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?
What do you mean?
It does. It really and truly does.
I Know!
Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
Thank you.
What?
Mine.
How do you feel about all this?
Mmm?
Yes, yes, you did.
Yeah, It's just... I don't think I can do this...
Look I was going to tell you!
Oh, who cares?
Ohh!
Ohh!
Alright, but you have to do one sometime.
It 's it's complicated okay?
Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?
Hiiii-Ya!!  I 'm serious! You're not walking out on my sister!
Ohh!
I am like Indiana Jones.
Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I...
That's closer.
Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can 't decide between the two of them. Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's not fun.
Oh no, not yet.
Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?
Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
Mon!
Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is!  Or isn't...
Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?
Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
Yes there will.  Oh guess what, Molly Gilbert you 've just been bumped up to table one. And if it's all right with you I'm gonna take your place at table six-Martin Clickclocken.
Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?
No. No-no. No. What would you do next?
Oh that 's right. Well uh, would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?
Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves.
Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
Joey's not going.
You-you just said that you did!
Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
What? That's impossible.
Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
Thank you.

Hi!
Well, I 'm gonna go get these  in some water.
Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?
Hi!
Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?
Hey, so uhm... How was dinner?
Great! I 'm across the street having sex with her right now. Your story sucks!
Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I've already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.
Sure, what 's up?
Oh just say it Kyle!
I was just leaving.
I don't know, but I.. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened. Where - where is my coat?!
Should we send something?
I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?
Oh, it's all over everything. Why? Why me?
Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know, butter him up? Anything he really likes?
She's still at dinner?
Bye.
Hey!
Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay.
Oh that 's great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo
Wow, it really is!
How's the maniac?
Two seconds
Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter.
Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think?  This blue suit, or this brown one?
OK. Oh, oh, oh.
Morning.
Y 'know what
Oh, no!! No, no!
Uhh No.
Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?
Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat.
Oh!

Yeah! Se vice?
Okay, okay, fine, you 're right. Let's ah, let's take a break,  let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something..
Well, there is an Arby 's in the shape of a tee-pee.
Well, is this Hillary your HOT assistant chef Hillary?
You bug me.
Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia.
Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids.
Yeah, we went shopping!
Dude, it's just  "Days of Our Lives"... there's no the.
Oh please!   You 're gonna say things now, aren't ya?
Marcel, c'mere, c'mere.  Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be-  Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.
I don't know you guys.
Thank you.
Ugh, she 's saying good-bye to her uncle.
No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.
Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else.
Hey!  Hi Bonnie!
Hi!
Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y 'know what I think? It's just she-she's weird. Y'know it's because she's a twin. Twins are weird.
Not broad backed!
Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?
Oh, I'm actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah, she's been away all week visiting her parents, but she'll be cool. I mean, she's been so supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, 'Fossils are my friends.'
Wait a minute... when you guys walked into the Met, did you go to the right?
I'm not a nice guy.
It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
What, what's that?
I know when I 'm 90 she'll be like 80 and it won't seem like such a big difference.
Well, so, you-you 'll get a job here! I mean, I'm always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!
No! No! Look -Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!
No-no-no, that 's great! I'll be there Monday. And thank you again!  Okay.   Umm, that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!
Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?
Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
I 'm-I'm gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!!
Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck?  No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder?
Oh, mine's December...
A lot of other gas smells
When you thought Joey proposed did did you say yes?
Hi! Hi, I 'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet , woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee?  Or maybe reimburse you for that one?
Yeah in fact, I 'm gonna go call her right now. And I'll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says
Well, I'm gonna kiss you.
Yep! Yeah, see this says D-13, and uh
So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?
Ohh, yeah I already have one.
Yeah.
Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!
Oh  Well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene
What is it?
I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
Actually, it wasn 't that close.
It was. It was an amazing night.
I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!
Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I -Ooh, a quarter!
Yeah. Tell ya what, let 's not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!
No.
I 'm gonna go.
Yeah.
Who the hell was that?!
Dude, what are you doing?
Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores.  You know, we as a group are not the coolest.
Hey!
We know you're out there.
What are you doing?
From you?  Yes, please!
Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...
You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there!
Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.
Are you serious?
And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?
Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured,  "Why not?!"
Yeah, okay you're right.
I 'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.
OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?
Yeah.
Oh! Oh, God!
No, no, really, I 've got to take the car back anyway, I'm spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It's fine, no guilt I promise.
Well she should, it was taken ten years ago!
And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don 't ya?
Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she 'd like to go out again.
Hey!
Oh, I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps for me.
I could ask her to live with me!
...But a man can change.
Sure!  Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year.
Oh, thanks, Pheebs!
Fine. I just need to know that you 're not gonna tell your sister.
Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...
No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding the phrase,  "Get the hell out of my way!"
Maybe he 's just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?
Yeah.
Ehh, I don 't, I don't think so. She's already talked about y'know, dating other guys.
Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great.  'Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
That sounds great. Same for me.
I mean, there 's no point in spending time with someone if-if it's just fun. It's gotta be, it's gotta be going somewhere right? So where-where is it going?  Ah! That's-that's the real question. And-and the answer is is it's going somewhere fun. Now I-I know what you're thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y'know, but you're-you're not getting any younger. No I mean-No not you, not you, you-you are getting younger. I mean -you-you look like you're getting younger by the second-What's your secret?
Excellent, that was excellent.
Is everything okay?
You're crazy.
No?
Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
I 'm so proud of you.
Hi Pheebs!
My God, the baby 's kicking. That's great. Although I kinda wish I-I would've been there to feel the kicking for the first time y'know.
Okay.
Damnit!
Thank you!
All right.
No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
Hey!
Really.
Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him.
Okay, okay, fine, you 're right. Let's ah, let's take a break,  let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something..
I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.
Thank you.
Okay.
It really was.
So that 's two of my wives.
You have a line down your face.
Hey.  Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?
He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.
Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?
I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?
I'm familiar with his work, yes...
What are you doing up?
Well sorry, that 's what I do on dates.
Hey, what you do on your own time...
And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it...
Hi Whitney.
That is one good looking man!
Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?
I think we do. Why don 't we go inside?  Look uh, I know why you're here.
Yeah! Got it!
You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
My God!
Hi! Yeah! Tommy 's in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in front of him, I think he's gonna snap.
Oh umm, well uh, maybe-maybe later. Right now, I 'm about to dance with this lady.
Hey, you'll never guess what just happened Phoebe and I got mugged!
Umm-hmm.
Hey!
Rings?
Yeah.
What happened to the Disgustingtons?
Hmm.
Y 'know what, I don't know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
No! No! Of course it didn 't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you
We 're still married! Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
You even have to ask?!    He is alive!
I'll do it!
And you didn't marry him because...?
No. I am not putting on makeup.
To talk to Rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the death-cab?
Oh God, no.
Well, that 's what I'm here for.  Want me to get that?
Yeah, I know the type.
What 's going on?
No, no, we won't.
Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!
There we go. All better.
Ugh, can you believe that guy!
You know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired.
Oh, by the way, great service tonight.
But work comes first!  Oh hey, but that 's sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?
Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?
Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it?
Oh I a lot of stuff!
What!  You didn 't do anything wrong?!
But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream.
I 'm reading your ad.
I...reorganized the fridge. See, bottom shelf
No, it wasn't.
I 'm sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, I'm dying.
I dropped him off at Carol 's.  Anyway, it turns out that I'm not going to be able to get those tickets though.
What's goin' on?
Oh.
A little. Yeah. I made a snack.
Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with it...
Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
Close. Ron.
What 'd you do, take him whaling?
That 's crap!! Sister Brown Bird.  Good going.
Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?
Thanks.  What photo album was it?
Are you all right?
Hey-hey you came! Man you look incredible! Hot stuff!  Hot stuff?
Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?
If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
So do we!! So do we!!  I 'm sorry you had to see that.
C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them.
Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship.  Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.
Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
"Hey Ross, it's you!"  Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.
Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.
Cigarettes?!!
Come on!  Here.
Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am.
What? What? What?!
Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
What's going on?
So basically all nuts?
Ah. Joey you 're-you're having lunch with my mom?
I 'm telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren't these the same flowers?
Looks like a fun gang.
Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know - Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?
No.
Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!
Hi!
Whad'ya mean?
What?  Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
And he 's, he's a total stranger?
Yeah, so far nothing stupid.
Oh...   Ohh... I'd love to but I really have to grade these papers.
Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!
That's, that's nice twice!
Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?
Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
Just a high pitched intimidating noise.
That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
What? No-no, a lurker.
Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.
Ohh! That would be great.
Oh, man, I'm not going to be able to handle this.  Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.
Okay, sure.
Hey guys!
Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice.
Joey!
Oh good, you scared me for a minute.
It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny...
Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized
Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.
Well I I haven't actually told her yet. I don't want to scare her off, y'know?
Oh, but-but I can 't do it.
I can 't, I can't even believe her! No, y'know what, I am, I am gonna go!
All right.  'Candy and Cookie?'
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
Forty-five minutes.
Namaste.
Of Ross and Rachel.
What are you, a child?
One more fight!
Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.
Well, but, but. . .
FINE BY ME!!
Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.
Ah!  Well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, y 'know give it a test ride.
Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.
Dear Lord!!
Hey.
You guys know where Rachel is?
Well, you just
Until now.
Sure!
I hope Ben has a little sister.
We 'll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth-me.
I never gave it to you.
No no, that's me.
Rach, I-I can't tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind? Unless, you know we're never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. You know it's a boy!
Should I leave this open for you too?
Okay.   What ah, what is the matter with you? What 's going on?
Yowzah!!!
I think we proved our point.
And in about five seconds you 're gonna see why.
Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.
Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn 't free?
Ohh, I don 't think so.
Oh. Uhh
Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce.
Great! Great. Then I must 've left it at Mona's. I knew it!
You're filthy!
What?
Smaller than that.
Really? Did you count Mississipily?
It was 5
Aww that is so cool.
Wha-what?
Watch.  Here, you ehm... You highlight the word you want to change.
Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?
Sure, go ahead. Whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead.
Really?
Oh good.
No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
Why is it inside out?!
Hey! Hi!
Why would I eat my own arm?
Oh my god, it was you! I can't believe it, you you mugged me?
OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys.
You? You! Want to watch Ben?  Yes! That'd be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is.
Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not.
We?! We angered it?!
Please don't take her away from me!
Are we really in Montreal?!
Wh Ã¢ÃÃ¦ whÃ¢ÃÃ¦what?
Hey!
Look, I don 't know what you're talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person.
You guys ready to go?
Hi Janine!
The head, the head. You gotta...
Hey, y 'know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.
What is it?
Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh  Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
No, no, let me finish.
That 's a good question, dad. That's a good question

Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy!
What? It's, it's just a phase.
Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I 'll guess just I'll come back.
I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!
Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat.
Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?
Kinda... spooky without any lights.
You 're welcome.
Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the  "brain transplant," you are going to be her?
Well umm
No problem, ok, mmmwa  oh, mmmwa  Susan...
No, I'll do it.
No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....
I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!
Well, how was the date?
Something about hi.
Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.
Can you believe that?
Look, she loved her job here. And let's face it
No, that's fine.
Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... with Emma... uhm... We just feel...
Dad?
This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must take a mental picture!  Ooh sorry
Oh wait -hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.
No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... tzz-zzz, mmm.
Oh, hi Chloe.
Look, I don 't think so Pheebs.  All right, I'll do it. But just because you're a friend.
Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.
The way he makes me feel about myself.
Hey, this-  Heyy...
I'm having... I'm having a baby.  I'm having a... Where's the phone? The phone?
Mon, Mon, are you OK?
It was a hug!
Yeah!
Well, Chandler and I are in a bar
Ohio!! Thank you!
What about Ben?
Yay!  Seriously, our sex life I was thinking, maybe I don 't know, we could try some-some new things. Y'know? For fun?
Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?
Yes, I did.
Sure.
Uhh, those are tacos.
Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.
That-that 's always good news. Are you okay?
Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.
That's who.
Pretty cool, huh?
Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.
No kidding?
"Heating device."
So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?
Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.
He 's not?
No!
Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.
I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?
Yeah, it is.
That 's great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!
No one ever asked me that, what's wrong?
Wow!
Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.
Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!
Getting married.  Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that too! Just like you 've done everything else!
Hi!
Mmm-Hmm.
No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!
Will you-will you please?
No, no, I 'm serious. Thank you.
I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly baked cookies.
Huh, I took a shot there.
Actually, um, I was thinking maybe both of us could go.
Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?
Did you really hear a bear?
Rachel, I can see you dialing! I don't understand why...
Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.
Hey!
See?
Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?
Yeah! Let's go out.
Look Phoebe, I 'm sorry it's just
No why?
No, us having to lie about being married.
No, of course, Um Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to say on behalf of my new bride, Rachel , and myself. Umm, that if if in 35 years, we're half as happy as you guys are, we'll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.
Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.
Hey!
I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives.
Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt.
Huh?
Oh that is quite all right ma 'am.
Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again.
Really?
No,  that that is not what we're saying.
Oh I 'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.

Just a smidge.
Some would say she 's attractive, yes.
I will be! Listen, I don 't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
All right. Feel good?
Well, OK, it's for a boy. Well, I know it's a little out there, but Darwin.
Huh-huh, they already know it.
Hey! I offered to marry her!
Hey, how 'd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?
I wasn 't farting!  Uh, a little game from our table.  Yes?
Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk!
Y 'know what?! It doesn't matter! It doesn't matter what you believe! What matters is what happened!
Five letters.
Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...
Monica?
Huh, what 's fish hooking...   Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
Really?
No, why?
Hello.
Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing.  Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.
And now you want that money back.
Yeah.
Are you guys sure about this?
This is Ross?
She's gonna be a scientist!
But also knowing it means a lot.
Hang it up! Hang up the phone!!
No, I mean it 's okay, I mean, they're-they're my friends. In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
Oh my God, what happened?
That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.
Okay, quick and painful.
Ohh. Ouch.
That's so sweet.
Hey, hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel.
Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings  in his ear.
No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
Yeah. I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know. And I just want it to be perfect and right and. . . why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint?
How come it 's always us left in the field holding the ball?
Umm, she kissed me.
Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
Umm?
Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
No really, you tell me what 's up.
I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
What?
There's something you didn't know about your dad!
I don't get it, he seemed so happy to see me yesterday.
3! 2! 1! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!
Ugh, museum.
Whoa! You had sex today?
Did you say something?
It 's still looks pretty far!
Hey!
I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice.  What you're-you're not mad?
Thanks. You ready to go?
He won't?
I saw you!
Aw forget it, it 's from Pier One.  Sorry.
I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
We're here!
Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?
It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know.  We're grown ups, this kinda stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore.
You tell them to wait!
Yeah!
Thank you.
No. It's the one he's licking.
Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her  and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.
What?
The Geller Cup.
Well, well, they're good. It's been a while since I've seen you like this. You, you clean up good.
Yeah, that's true. Except I don't wanna get over her.
I 'm trying.
Hello.
You got me.
Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.
Better not be doin' these in order.
I 'm telling you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think he's baaad news!
Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities.
What is ah, Rach in her room?
This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now , she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you- will you help me out here?
No? What happened, big guy?
And we didn 't have sex.
Thank you. I'm glad you agree.
Yeah.  Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must 've added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.
I'm not scared of him, I'm really sick!
Congratulations! Congrats!
Okay.
Yeah.
Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don 't want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?
Yeah!
No, it's not just that. It's just -I want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh...
Hey.
Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna...
So, do we really have to ask who 's going up on the platform next?
Well, ya know, someone should have called me.
How did you know that?!!!!
Wow!
Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna.....
Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place.  I'm Ross.
You take your time.
Wow! That aspirin dance really works!
...No, we hate him.
Yeah, tell me about it.
No, hi, I 'm, I'm an honorary Brown Bird
Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!
Hey! I just heard. What's up?
It's ok. I'm sorry.
I missed you too.
No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.
It doesn't matter. You don't dip your pen in the company ink.
We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.
Hi, Pheebs!
You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.
Oh.
Ooooohhhh.
Oh my God!
Hey!
Why?!
Oh. Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin'?
Okay.
What?! What does he want?! I wasn 't doing anything!
That is precious! Listen! I need Rachel's flight information.
It was just a kiss.
No, we can go to Williamsburg.
Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldn 't be more thrilled for both of you, but as Monica's older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down, and kick your ass!  What? I'm-I'm-I'm serious!  Come-Hey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? I'm-I'm not kidding here!
You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what 's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Relax, I'll fix it.
There 's nothing the matter with me. See, I'm not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.
Spring vacation.
Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.
I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it 's temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? "Professor Geller."
Why?! Are there like bears or something?!  Ohh. Oh, protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot.
Ohh, this cake is really good!
Okay, seriously, what do you think?
And that 's Phoebe over there!
What are you doing?
Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.
Thanks man.
You can see where he'd have trouble.
Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen , I mean, I feel like-
I got it -I'm getting it!
Uh, I haven't.
Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?
So it 's really a question of who could you have possibly done.
It 's sex.
Got me.
Pheebs, did you want a cookie?
Oh my God, I love you.
What? That's like insanely easy!
You were under the pile of coats?
Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?
There was no song.  There was no song!
Hey!
It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it 's revealing which I'm fine with, no I'm concerned about your health, sun exposure.
No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want to know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go.
uhu uhu, check this out.
Yeah.
What's going on?
Hi guys.
Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.
Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain.
I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.
Yeah? Me too.  Gettin ' a little tired though.
Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}
Thank you.  No!
Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don 't, don't just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn 't she know it's our anniversary?
Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend Phyllis take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.
So?
Yes please.
What about the time I said we were on a break?
Guess what?
Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.
Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you 're wrecking it.
At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're having sex on the couch, its like
Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.
Get away from me I said no!
Ok!
You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! Come here
Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
Okay, here we go...
One, two, three, four!
Please tell me you're joking.
Monica couldn 't tell time 'til she was 13!
I don't know.
...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.
Dad, dad, please. Look I don't want anything to upset Emily tonight. Alright, she's had a hard enough couple of days as it is.  Now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?
FINE BY ME!!
And bus.
Hi ma.
Actually I 'm a palian Dinosaurs is fine the drawing is not.
Phoebe!
Huh uh-huh.
Like what?
You promised you wouldn't say anything.
Congratu!!  -lations-lations.
Tsz... NO! .
Oh! like what?!  Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch  "Access Hollywood".
I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
Move in with me.
Yeah.
Yep! That's hilarious!
No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault and kind
Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
Don't toy with me.
It's all right.
Come on, you made coffee!
Come on! Joe!
I'm done.
No. Sorry man.
Rach, did you proofread these?
Wow. I 'm sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that.
So, ah . . . So, how was it? Uh, did you guys. . . Did you guys have a good time?
Yeah. So
Technically, huh, no.
I actually had a topic in mind! I 'm, I'm kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.
Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared.
So, can you trust me?
What 's-what's the difference?
What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's like if a woman wanted to be...
Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
Chandler! Chandler!
Look, look I 'm sorry. It's just that....
Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
You're kid's name is Raymond!
See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y 'know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I I won't play anymore.
Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.
Yes, that 's what I was going to ask, thank you.
Wow!
Okay, okay, yes, it is.  How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.
Oh, that's me.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way.
Oh.
Well, now I do!!
Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say
Woohoo!
Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
Who?
Are you intrigued?
Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh...  I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.
I know, it's pretty great.
Yeah...
What am I going to do?
Hey!
Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio.
Hi Phoebe.
No but but still you can't possibly do this alone.
Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!
Let 's grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.

Well then we 'll-we'll see you the day after tomorrow.  Mom?! Dad?!  What-what what you guys doing here?!
Excuse me?
So, then you can stay as long as you want.
Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.
...What shoe?
That's not true!
No!
Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!
No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second.  That's my friend's machine.
Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
He sounds swell.
Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back-  come here, Marcel-
Yeah. What are we gonna do?
Get away!
Hello.  Hi sweetie.  Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it.  So will you come to New York?
No! No! Oh my God. Did she get off the plane? Did she get off the plane?
All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn 't mean you have unagi.
Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
Please.
Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new  old sheet?
Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
Your ex-boyfriend?
Look, I didn 't think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.
Okay, I-I 'll see you tonight.
And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities.
Yeah, I guess we don 't have a choice.  Help us! Please help us! We're stuck up on the roof and we can't get down!!!
What?  Why not?
Mornin '
Here we come, walkin' down the -this doesn't smell like Mom's.
Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.
Yeah?
Yes, I do.
Well... not in the same way...
Yeah, you 're right.
Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
Ohh, here's that Macadamia nut!
No thanks.
No-no, we talked about it. We don't want to know. All we care about is that it's happy and healthy.
Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
Oh, see I-I don 't know if we're gonna be hungry at three.
You may want to lose the foam finger!
And, I don 't know, if it starts to rain
Correct, his profession was?
Okay, it 's second down.  Take all the second downs you need.
Hey, hello! mmwa!  I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna.
Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.
What?
Okay... okay, maybe I will...
Y 'know, she tried to undress me too.
No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
Wha, what?
Ewwww!!
We said it was only going to be two weeks, y 'know?
I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.
Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki.
Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.
Yep.  Okay.
You still on that?
Oh, that 's right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that's gotta be embarrassing!
No.
With you?! Yeah right!
M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.
You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
No, but ah, there 's coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.
Look -Okay, I'm just gonna-I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
Oh my god. You are pure evil.
Is there a hopping bonus?
So why don 't you quit?
Oh sure.
People ask me why we 're not together, I just don't know what to tell them.
No really, I-I am! I feel bad!
Good.
Wait a minute! No! I 'm the nice one! I'm the one who danced with the kids all night! How How small are your feet?!
At the coffeehouse, right.
Sure, okay.
Oh, it's not over!
Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together.
What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.
What?
Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before, and you know what? You should be. It's a big deal!
Oh, man!
Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.
Oh! Y'know, I 've got an extra futon.
Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and...
So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?
That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
I'm never gonna find love again.
Yeeeeeep Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad 's boat she wouldn't let me help at all.
A date?
What?!
There are naked ladies there too.
And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little
Yes, and that's why we're here.
Well, I... I am having a good hair day.
I guess it could.
Rachel! I'll just call her back.
Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free.
I whitened them.
Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?
You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?
Oh please, hit by a blimp?
I am the guy who's taking care of our baby while you're out at bars meeting guys!
What do you think you 're doing?!
Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we 'll be able to find a new place for the wedding.
Calm down, I'm blow drying.
Does it always, uh--?
I don 't know why you can't admit that you need me.
No. No.
Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than,  "Spring break!"  All right? I mean she's taken my class!
Oh!
That's... that's classic.
ÃÃ¡Lo que sucedio es que no le gusta la tele!
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.
Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we 're gonna have younger looking skin!
When did I say you were boring?!
Rach, Rach, we'll be fine, all right? You go have fun.
Well, it needs to be plicit.
Fine! It 's your life!  I just don't want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together,  but that 's what you want, there's nothing I can do.  DON 'T DO IT!!!!!
No but, no but.
Who?
Are you not seeing him anymore?
Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
Yeah. He could row like a viking.
Can we, can we just stop for a second? Who said something better would come along, huh? You didn't believe me. I told you everything was gonna work out.  You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
That's not advice!
Oh, come in.
I gave him an extremely professional massage!
Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
Here you go.
Wow! What a pleasure.
Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater.
What?
What happened?
Nevermind!
You're bleeding.
Oh! Oh my God oh! Oh my God she 's here.
All right!!
And what did he ask you not to call him?
No.
Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that 's-that's when I really found my sound.
Y 'know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!
Ohh.
That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.
Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
Man! They cannot get enough!
Yeah. Look if-if she 's gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn't find a better guy. So
Yeah and he didn 't really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.
You've never said that in your life, have you?
She 's fine. She doesn't know you're gone. And she doesn't have to know, okay? Now come on, we're going home.
As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married?
I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...
God no!
Grazie.
Hey!
Hi Amy!
Yeah!
Wow, that 's-that's-that's incredible.
No, it 's my joke, it's mine. You can call them, they'll tell you.
And why exactly would I do that?
One.
Yeah.
Hey!  So, how was Atlantic City?
Step back.
Yeah, and it was uhm... it was like a real little person laugh too. It was... it was like uhm...  Only... only not creepy.
When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
Still thinking about it huh?
Yay!
Okay, she can 't go.
Did you just wink at me?
No one got me an engagement present.
Yeah, but wait...
Uh, hello, it 's third down.
Rachel! Rachel Green!
Well, she'll call back, don't be such a baby.
Hi.
I bet two dollars.
Really?! Wow! That 's-that's so nice, what are you gonna get me?
And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!
Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can't... I can't go through with this.
Yeah?

No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I mean, really happy. I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know.
What's the matter?
Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!
Mm.
No, I 'm serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if she's not where you are, then you can start to move past this.
Something could 've happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
If you wanna call that a reason.
Yeah!
I don 't think you have much choice.
Yeah, take your time.
E-except, except that what?
Hey Chandler, there 's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then.
200 dollars.
No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.
Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,
Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.
I don 't know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
Yeah! We 'd meet, we'd meet total strangers, and hang out with them!
God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.
Okay.
That would be great.
We're not done.
Rach, you don't have to call whenever you have a little question, okay? Trust me, I know this.
It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
Look at you! You 're up!
That sounds fair.
Whoooaa!
I 'm sorry I'm late, did I miss anything?
Hey! How 'd the ah, basketball go?
Yeah, cheerie-o!
Look, I took it too far!
No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden.  No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye.
Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.
Oh, thank you.  Hey, hey.  Rachel!!!!
Oh.
Well, uh, does she like you?
Hey.
Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?
You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but- but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
I don 't know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I'll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!
Thanks to a little something called "Helvetica Bold 24 point"!
Aww, come on.
He 's taking her purse!
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
Yeah, all right, it 's a date.
Shake it!
Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
Y 'know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
Well, there goes my whole belief system.
Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
Thank you.
I 'm sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.
Uh, unless! Unless, uh this lady wouldn 't mind letting you go first.
No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car!  Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now!
Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.
Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
But, won't she notice I have makeup on?
Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-one 's turned them.
That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?
Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?
Hello!
Yeah, well nah.
In the hospital.
Come on Rach, you don 't have what, ten minutes?
Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh,  "Keep your mitts off my grub?"
Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I 'll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.
Pheebs, I think she 's great. Okay? We're going out again.
Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water?
Hey!
Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.
Why?
Can I have everyone 's attention please? I'm uh; I'm Ross Geller.
Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
No, no, no, but...
Burt!
What are you doing?
Hey, y 'know what? This is your fault! You're the one that didn't move his-his appointment.
What?!
What?
Okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great.
Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I 've been married and how I have a son.
What? I can 't cancel on Joan!
Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?
Ok, ok. I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you, I mean, you can't be alone right now.
Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship.
Great. Great.
Momentary lapse. Don't-don't you have any self-control?
I prefer not to answer that right now, I 'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
Yeah.
Yeah, it 's hard okay, I only have two spots left.
Hi!
I don 't know! I guess I just can't believe any of this is happening.
No! No it 's not. Joey, this is a smart idea.
Okay, okay, we 'll just get everyone to act like they like it. That- that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie!
So what do you want me to do?
Hey, y 'know, y'know what would make me really happy?
But...
No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.
Good.
Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she 's right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.
Oh, sure! I 'm sure.
Well I 'm jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won't have a father if-if I die!
I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?
No, I 'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
No. Did you?
What, what is it?
Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'
It's too cold.
I'm sorry, my pie was, was in your hood. Now I just have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants and I'll be back in the hospital by 7.
Hey.
Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.
Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now?
The kid...?  Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.
Huh.
Hi.
The one with the cat. I gotta go, I 've got another date.
Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
What 's up with the greed Joe?
Do not give him any money!
What 's the matter?
I can 't believe it.  Can I tell you something? I'm a little mad at him now.
I don't know, probably just invest it.
No see now, now I can't because uh, I'm feeling too self conscious.
Oh, I don 't, I don't, I don't know
You know, I really don't want to get involved in you guy's relationship.
I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we 're face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we're-we're butt to face.
Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!
Yeah! They 're putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel 's gonna film it!
Oh, no!
Oh.
Umm, say you 're gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?
I do.
Okay, here I go.
It 's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.
You ate my sandwich?
Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in  the laundry room.
I made fun of his accent.
Right.
Okay, Jasmine, please, please don 't. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?
Okay.  Wow, it 's-it's 5
Oh my God!
I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff-
That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
I fell asleep!
What?
So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?
Thanks.
I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
Hey-hey Pheebs!
So, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared, or  did he cry?  Yeah, big surprise, I like proposals!
No! Stop!
Look I told you
Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?
It went great! And I didn 't need any jokes or naked chicks either!
Oh...
Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, I 'm sure I can make it this time. I just I just can't be afraid to get a little bit hit by cars.
Uhh, okay, it 's uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.
No!
Ahhh.
Hey.
Hey!
Oh.
Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines!    'Sup?
Joey proposed to you?
Oh I 'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due.
Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?
Yes! Please!
O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she 's really upset we're just talking.
All right, that 's it, I'm getting out of here.
Hey!
And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.
Rach, come on, if you think about it, it 's actually kinda funny.  Okay, maybe it's best not to think about it.
Okay. Well, apparently Chandler 's angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
You don't, you don't know what your wearing?
According to Chandler, what phenomenon scares the bejeezus out of him?
Huh? So? We have a deal?
No the man 's right, that's what I had with Rachel.
Are you're hands still wet?
Oh!  Ah.  Aw!
No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's
Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?
Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?
The judge wouldn 't let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?
Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing guy.
Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today.
All right!
Well, that makes sense.
No! No, I won 't! I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.
Okay Rach, but
Rach you did not leave the water running. Please, just pull yourself together, okay?
Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I 'm gonna kill myself, I swear. I can't, I can't watch this.  Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she's going in.
Look, it's just a little more complicated...
Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I 'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth--Nothing!!
I don 't care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
Yes!!
I 'm sorry man.  Here's a thought. This is the same ballroom. There's a band. There's gonna be plenty of dressed up people.
You were trying to eat it!
Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby 's face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. . That is a weird sentence!
And you 're afraid you won't be able to fill his shoes.
Yeah, that 's our baby.
Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.
Okay, okay, I 'm sorry, it will never happen...  Uh-oh! Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I'm the king.
Really?
Okay, okay! I 'm going. I'm going.
Chandler?  Chandler?
Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.
What disposable cameras?
Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?
Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, she 's more.. y'know, and you're more
Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don 't I have to wait a while?
Good evening officer.
I like that.
Ok.
And I'm fine never having heard it...  Rach, can I... can I see you for a sec?
Never?
Hey Mon.
Uh lately, she just likes hanging out here.
Hey!
Yeah right.
She said,  "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she said, "Thank you."
No! Okay! Okay!  Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to you for a second?
You did it, man.
You want me to take some girl I 've never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.
Uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn...
You know the song! Sing along!
Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it.
I fell asleep!
What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even...
Hey! Wha-hoo! What's this?  Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?
Okay,  Fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect two cool points. Yeah.
Remember the Russian satellite, Sputnik?  Well, I 'm a potato or a spud. And these are my antennae.  So Sputnik, becomes  Spud-nik. Spudnik!
I like it, and Emily likes it, and that 's what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?
Hi!
Who?
Noooo!!! Every time!!!
Hi!
Phoebs, It's open! It's open!
I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.
Uh-huh.
Is this what you had in mind?
Meth-methane smells
Oh, just this woman I've been seeing.
We fell asleep! That is all.
I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy!
Yeah I-I don 't-I don't think I'm quite there yet, but I could say I looove spending time with you.
No need to point, she knows who Ross is.
Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way.
What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.
Here she is!
Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?
Yes I am.
Oh. Crab cake?
Would it matter?
Yeah.
Wow! Great!  Wait, dad who-who 's cigarettes are these?
I know, and with the baby coming?
There's something new in the bowl.
Hey, hey. I know you love me. I know you do.
Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.
Okay, 'you' can't, or  you can't?  Okay, that's my finger.  That's, that's my knee.  Still doing the play. Aaah!
Yeah.
OH!
I don 't want to do that.
Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan
Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.
I can 't think of anything.
I don 't know. A month?
She said what?
Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the-  -the bus stop... I'm fine.
Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me "Daddy" too.
Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
Well, we 're all here! I guess we should get going!
Hey there you go!
Okay, wish me luck.
Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock 's a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
Carol?
Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application.
So, we 're off.
Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time.
Uh, huh. Yeah, right after I thank everyone for giving money to the museum, I sing a song about the wonder that is Joey.
So what, we just sit?
Look, G. I. Joe 's in, Barbi 's out. And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'
I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
Yeah but still, I mean it should 've been me. I'm the dad.
I can't believe you guys are moving in together. That's, that's great! I mean...I'm happy for you guys..
Only way to fly.
I cannot sleep in a public place.
I can.
Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine's Day? What's going on, huh? Girl trouble?
Really?! We are?
I really think they 're out of rooms.
Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.
Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her?
Hey.
Well I, that 's the thing, I don't know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said,  "This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let's just enjoy "
Hey.
Dad, dad I don 't want to hear about it.
Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?
Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.
Oh, I missed you too.
Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
Are you wearing two belts?
No, I fold.
Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...
I 'll try to control myself.
Oh.
Okay.   So uh, well, this-this is uh, this is awkward.
Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out.
Man... I... I'm sorry.
Uh yeah, I guess -Yeah! I guess so.
Hey man.
Hey, I know what 'll get us up on a platform!
It 's Gandolf, and he's not coming.
Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?
Right.
Yay!
This is insane, I 'm not gonna make love to you just so that you'll go into labor.
O-ok. Just relax, Phoene, just stay calm. . Oh my god, I can't find my wallet.
You kissed her.
No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people.
Do you like it?
Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...
Uh, double latte, extra foam.
All right, show's over. Nothing to see here.  Ok, let's do laundry.
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!!
...Yeah.
Hey.
Yeah.
Come here, here, come here, come here,  Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend 's mother.
Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.
Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.
I go back there with lawn ornaments, he's going to laugh in my face.
No.
Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.
No, you started it.
Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone 's name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
Oh.
It 's okay man, be strong.
Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village.  And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.
Baby got back
Yeah! I don 't know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of sexy professor vibe?
Sure, because women never like Joey. Y 'know, I think he's a virgin.
Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay.
Hey! High-five!
Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
You were at the coffee house!
What happened? Joey?
I'm in.
Okay, okay, okay.  I 'll get the bagels.
And you told Phoebe you were engaged.
Oh, come on, you know it's a girl!
You're kidding. Oh my God.
Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived!  Here.
Yay!!
Yeah!
See, I would never snap at you like that.
Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!
That's great! That's wonderful!
So, how dark is it gonna get?
Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom!
Well what is it? Is it a mole?
Get married.
That's okay. We'll talk about  something else.
Oh, come on!
I know it is pretty unbelievaaaaah.
Yeah, a lot of my students do that.
You gotta be at least bi...
True, but you 're allowed to be unreasonable. You're having our baby.
Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.
I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens.
Why did you do that?
Please be kidding.
Funny story!
Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
I am not doing this over the phone.
Okay.
It 's okay. Come, come on in.
Okay.
I'm good, I have dinner plans .
Phoebe!
No! But we-we didn 't have sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don't remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
What? What? What? What is it?
Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom
Hey. How did you sleep?

No no no!
So soon?
Second date!
Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything.
No, 10 is the highest.
Uh, y 'know what? I'll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal's office wearing nothing but a catcher's mitt!
Yeah, that 's okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I 'm alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.
Yes, you can, very much.
D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
Oh, please...
What?
What?! The guys against the girls? See, that 's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns.
So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?
Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd 's Pie!
Then you are neither of your parents!
Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?
It 's still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!
Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.
Yeah, didn't I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we haven't being going out for too long, but rather there is this
What?!
I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
It 's okay, I'm ready.
Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.
That 's okay Rach, we're not liking Ross right now.
Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!
Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
Hey!
Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...
Alright.
Well, howdya feel?
Ok, use it in a sentence.
Well, I 'll-I'll be there. I mean I have to wear a costume to all my classes that day anyway so
I would, but I bruise like a peach. Besides, y you know, everything is gonna be fine. The baby's sleeping.
Well, not really. I mean technically it 's-it's not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.
All right, there you go!
Keep pushing!
This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
Would you excuse us for a second?  Umm . what are you doing?
Um, you know, just out of curiosity...
What?
Done! With time a-to-spare.
That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.
You look pretty tonight.
I guess it 's worth a try.
What a pity stay?
Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women don 't even feel them.
My hands?
You're not going to go.
Your good friend?
Look at that, they won't even turn their heads.
Uh huh.
Joey!
Well good, okay. I-I, kind of think y 'know if we if You're wearing the ring.
Yeah.
Y 'know-thanks!
Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees.
Par-tay!
No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby. Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming.  Hey! My sweater! I 've been looking for this for like a month!
Pretty amazing huh?
Yeah!
No anchovies.
With mealworms.
Ohhh.
What?
Sure. Why not?
Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?
I was hugging her as a friend. It 's not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she's got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh coconutty.  What?! Oh, that doesn't mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!
What kind of problem?
Oh-oh really?
Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
You sure?
Together? Like-like to people?
Huh. That's a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.
Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we 're gonna break-up instead.
But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?
So, are you gonna see him again?
Okay.
Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.
That depends, how much did you hear?
Well you need 60% to pass
Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.
Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered
Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.
Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of MASH and half the hostages coming home?
Still me.
What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?
See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
Why don 't they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that's a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That's fun too! Whew!!
Yeah?
Oh.. you don't get it!
Come here, come here. Uh,  ow! Emily, will you marry me?
Oh, well, er, I already ate, but sure...!  Guess what happened at work today...
Yes! That 's where we realized we were both super cool people!
What did you do?
Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like  ten minutes left!
Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?
Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
Oh yeah, why not?
Hi!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait-wait!
This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half!
Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh...
If only he were a woman.
this summer?
You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that 's not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there's a concept you should really be familiar with. It's what the Japanese call  unagi.
Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.
What was, what was that?
They published my paper.
Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you 're obsessed with her. It's always, "Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?" "Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel?" "When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?" You want her!
Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.
Just a second!
Right.
Yeah...
Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.
Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby.
Thread!
Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?
Two, I think a two.
Wow! Thanks, you guys. That 's uh-ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I'll be right back! Okay?  This is so nice, I'm-I am so
Hot dog?
Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?
No, you let me fini...
Or that.
Hey!
Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!
That would be me.
Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.
Oh Rach that 's great. That's great.
Okay. Well, thanks, ah, thanks for the beer.
What?!!!
Oh that 's not pretty.
It was 5
Yes. And another time after that. Boy I 'm getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?
It really was.
Fine, y 'know what, that's it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.
What the hell are you doing?
Good for you.
Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog! Y'know Monica couldn't get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.
Hi, Julie.
Get to the problem!
Amazing... amazing.
Gunther.  Hey-hey! Why don 't we put them on? Y'know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.
Well, actually it 's been great. She's 20 so she's not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.
Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six.
Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.
I'll get it! I will get that!
Call me!
That's okay, Joe.
Gimme the bottle.  Gimme the towel.
Tuesday right. Ok, bye you guys.
Sweet!
What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.
No, no, no, I'm sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney's?
Way to go guys. Y 'know, you-you were really good at the stuff too.
How hot is this?!

Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.
Shh. Do you want cran-apple or cran-grape?
What?
Hi! Hi, I 'm uh Ross. I'm here to ruin this magical day for you.
No! No, I don 't don't want to.
Uh, no... no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.
Playpen?! Ben 's seven!
Oh what 's the big deal?! I wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y'know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we'll-we'll leave early as a sign of protest.
What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!
The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we 're getting married.
Yes.
Well, yeah!
Won't you dance around with me.
No, not since I lost her at the airport.
It 's all right! Everything's gonna be all right.
Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...
Ranion's theory of species variegation?
'Why don't you call him?!' Well, thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!
How could I forget?
Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?
Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . .
Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush.
Oh really! Why is that?
College?
Well, I'm so excited about this.
I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it.
Hey, uhm, Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that
"... Sarah. I dig you ", Uh? "Doctor Ross Geller".
I have been working out.
Uh-oh, saved by the bell.  Hello?
Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby 's ears!
All right, gentlemen, you 're up first.
Happy Thanksgiving!
What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.
What about the guy from the bar?
Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.
Wow Monica! Hey, just so you know I had my uh, older brother chat with Chandler.
Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
So uh... I guess I wanna take off.
Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want Monica and Chandler.
Oh, hello.
Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.
Yeah.
Uh well umm we're just not in that place, y'know? But we're very excited about this.
This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks.
And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me.
What?!
Great!
Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
Cassie?
No.
Really. It's always been you, Rach.
... finally...
All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.
Yeah.
Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!
Really? I 've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
Until we start to look very small.
That 's right, and that's why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.
No.
And it works both ways.
What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
Halftime.
Well, let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the pediatrician's office.
No you didn 't.
Oh, you 're nice to her.
Oh, that's great, that is great!
Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
Well, okay, what-what did she say?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?
What?! What?!
You hated me when we were kids?
Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first.
Monica, what is the matter with you?
What?  That 's great. That is great.  What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
Joey, get out of the fridge.
Well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi ..  no I can't.
Hey!
Well we just wanted to stop by and uh, say goodnight.
You 're moving?
Well, we-we haven 't said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay to say it to other people.
Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out?
He-he was with me umm, we 're playing a little game, y'know? Hide and seek.
Joey, you owe $1100 at I Love Lucite.
Okay,  if you 'll excuse me, I-I'm gonna go hang out with some people who don't know the Space Mountain story.

No, I will not!
I don't even wanna hear it, you're just...
Great! Great!  You 're making the bike very happy.
Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well.
Great.
Okay.  Uh, huh. Excuse me, I 'm sorry, I-I think you may be in our seats.
Oh my god...
Yeah, I 'm just gonna grab my coat. And uh, and my whip.  Y'know because of the Indiana Jones?  Not-not because I'm-I'm into S&M.  I'm not-I'm not into anything weird. Y'know? Just-just normal sex.  So, I'm gonna grab my coat.
Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
Emily's cousin kicked me out!
What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?
Save it.
Yeah.
Uh fellas,
Thanks.
What?! What?!
She's not- past, she's present, she's back.
Divorced men 's club.
C'mon Rachel.
Was I talking to her about gas?
Oh my God! What happened to the door?!
Y 'know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that's half human and half pure evil!
Yeah.
I guess so.
Yeah he was wasn't he.
Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
So he hasn't called?
Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means...
...How long was I in there?
Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think?  Two days of darts, it 'll be great!
Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
What?!
Nothing, nothing. Everything's under control.
What do you mean?
Oh, it was, nah, well....
Ok.
Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store!  Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.
Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.
Uh, middle balcony.
Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
That 's it. That's it.
Okay. Okay. If uh, if you 're gonna do this, then I'm gonna do that.  So
Okay. I can, I can see that. Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind.
Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn 't invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?
That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!
That's great!
What?  Ow!
No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?
Hey-hey, what are those?
Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah. Will uh, will this help with the knob getting?
Much better.
Thanks.
I always knew I was havin' a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me.
Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?
I uhm... Well, I sang...  well actually I rapped... Baby Got Back...
See?
Oh-ho, whoa! Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled this hot coffee on you.
oh boy you got mad at that part. I went over there to tell him how great you are but you know me BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, and I ended up telling him that.
Tony?
What happened?
Yeah.
Are you into crafts at all?
It was totally flirting.  "Somebody got a haircut "
150 dollars.
I'm serious. C'mon, you should go. Here.  No, uh-uh, just go.
Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
Aw, he's gonna be so happy.
I don 't want people to see it for your sake.
It 's-it's hot
Well I, I don't know. Why?
Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movieÃ¢ÃÃ¦
And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.
Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together.
Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe, you just said it!
Ohh, it's Joey! I love Joey!
Well this uh, this may be a little awkward.
Phoebe, you can 't force kids to be friends.
You think?! God, I, ah, I 'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all like, 'I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, 'What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did.
So how many more do you have tomorrow?
Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?
Oh, really!
Yeah, come on in. Molly?
Well, Monica keeps changin' the channel.
The small one.
Fine.
NO!
That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...  It's not funny!!
No, no, don't, don't, rub it! Don't!  What gets out hummus?! What gets out hummus?!
And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!
I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she 's like OLD NEWS!
Fine! Fine! Y 'know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You're the mommy.
Bye-bye!
What?
Yeah, I-I really do.  Hey! This-this was a gift?!
Don't go.
And it can't be Joey.
Okay, so it wasn 't uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.
Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn 't get messed up?
Monica!
Hey, I was looking out for you.
Thank you, thanks.  Yeah, I lost it. Y 'know, I'm not gonna play anymore,  would you, can you finish my set?
1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon 's party. I played you one of my songs, y'know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.
The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn 't realized she was a lesbian.
Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
I'm going to the bathroom.
You 're great. And I-I know someday this will happen for you too. You just hang in there.
Well, I have a PhD, so...
What kind of research?
Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars?
Y 'know I would it's just painful.
Sometimes, you should come over  sometime! I 'll play you one of my other
Yeah.  Anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best.
Uh, yeah! I still can 't believe she hates Pottery Barn!
No. No, I gotta go home sometime.
What woman?
What's wrong?
Please take your time, it 's an important decision. Not like, say, I know! deciding to marry someone, this is about a muffin.
Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
I know I am!  ...And when it's summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?
Action.
Hi!
Well uh, it's cause he had a thing with, wi-, with the thing.
He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!
Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.
No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?
Yeah?
So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!
Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! I 'm the teacher!!
What happened?
yeah I really, really need to talk to you about something.
Look at me!
Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, I-I-I think she 's cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!
Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she 's-she's sweet and pretty and
Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that.
I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.
Wait hold on Tony, hold on.
So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I 'm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
Hey!
Oh, yeah! Right!
Hey, there is uncle Joey!
Yah, because Phoebe knew the mugger!
What big thing?
Uh Mona just dumped me.
What? Where?
Now, hold on! Hold on!  Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I 'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all!  That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
Tough noogies, we're watching Predators of the Serengetti.
Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know.  But, uh... look how happy she is.
You bought Shawn Cassidy!
And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.
Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!
No-no-no, I-I wanna play.
Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date?
Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that- that... that's not why we bought the ticket.
All right.
Well I I told him that if he ever hurt you I would hunt him down and kick his ass!  What?! What?! What is the matter with everybody?! I am serious! I would kick his ass!
Calm down. There 's no reason to get testy.
Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!
Well, we-we said we 'd just do it that one time but, but now I think she may wanna start things up again.
FINE BY ME!!
wow, are you still going to move in with him?
Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
oh yea now um how is that going, is it getting serious?
Oh. Can I... can I ask who?
Oh yeah!
What was Monica's nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don 't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
Oh my god.
Sid you lucky deaf bastard.
Fine! Y 'know what? It doesn't matter, because, if I remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.
I 'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
Ahh.
I 'm telling you, just a little bit at a time.
Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!
All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
It 's winter, they are fewer people on the street.
Cat!
Eeaagh!
Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?
Anyone else? Huh? Bring  'em on!
Yes I would.
I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.
Good.
no, no, no there's nothing wrong with you I mean you don't strike me as the type of person that wants to get married anyway.
All right.
I told you there was going to be sub-titles.
Oh, veto. How about-Ooh, I like Ruth! What about Ruth?
Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
Here, go nuts.
Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you- you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.
Scotch. Alright, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass.
I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone 's all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I'm gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.
I'll get it.
So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.
Really?
No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors.
Who's laughing now?
What?
Hey, how 's it going?
No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn 't heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandler's parents again!
Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?
Oh! God! Wow!
Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...
Oh no.
Woah.
Yeah.
Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel , yeah! About jellyfish and how if you...  Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?
And thank you, for that.
My marriage is over.
Oh thank you. Thanks very much.  Ow!
Well, he had gravity boots.
I 'm sweeping...
Come on, seriously.
Hey! She didn 't look 50!
Well, Chandler 's my oldest friend, but Joey's my-No! Ah!
Hey!
Oh my God!
Yes it is too slutty!
Yeah.
So, how was the honeymoon?
The paper.
You made it!
Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin ' guy.
So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty cool.
So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even.
No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
Well l-look okay, it 's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
Is that what I want?
What 's that on the bottom?
I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.
Do you feel better?
Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.
I did.
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
I do too! I do too!
Hi!
Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils...
That 's what you said last night.
No. No, y'know you don 't, you don't wear enough of this.  What?
No-no, that 's-that's not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!
Look let 's not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn 't even matter!
Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home alone.
Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean 's office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?
Crazy.
Books?
I want my turkey now!
Oh great! That means I 'm stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there  and you were sittin' right here! Whoa!"
Night.
Oh, yumm!
Did the TV wake you?
Here she comes. Don 't say a word, okay? Just be cool, don't be y'know you.
Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...
Come on!
Jen, I know this may sound a little  But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or
The lie you just told.
Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing. And you know what I did?
No! I balanced my checkbook.
Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the history.
Uh actually, sorry I can 't even make it. I'm seeing Mona again tonight.
Okay. All right. So let 's see, let's play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we'll kick off.
All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!
That is so made up!
Hey.
Hey!
But it absolutely didn 't.  It didn't!! It didn't!!
Ohh.
What difference does that make?!
well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in a serious relationship.
Well, yeah, of-of course I 'm okay! What? I'm just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and  what-what is uh, what's this?
Still?!
Come on, show them to me.
Well, then who was on my bed?
Please don 't say naked chicks.
Oh yeah, no no no...that's great!
No! No I can 't. I mean Rachel's out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.
Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
Well, if he 's angry, he really shouldn't just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.
Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...
GIVE ME MY PUCK!!
You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.
Hmm.
Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
I don 't know, aheh, your's was the first name that-that popped into my head, I'm I'm sorry. I-I didn't think it would matter.
Oh, hey...
Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?
Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?
Hey.
The physical act of love.
No, just give me another minute.
Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand
Okay.
You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
Hey, what are you guys doing?
No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.
Rach!
No thanks!
Yeah, I want my money back.
All right then.  Rachel Green! Let's play Bamboozled!  How do you test the temperature of the baby's bath water?
Yeah, yeah, what is it?
Oh, yeah.
Helen Geller? I don't think so.
What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?
Well? Isn't that amazing?
Great!
I have a bone to pick with you.
Lift!! And slide!
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
I just -I-I can't believe she's-she's dating?!
You got it.
Thank you!
That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.
Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.
Yeah!! Yeah!
Listen, I 'm ah, I'm sorry I've been so crazy and jealous and, it's just that I like you a lot, so...
Okay. Well, you be careful.
You 're welcome.
L!
Well, let's just go in there and face them.
So?
Hey!
What?  Oh my God! She- she thinks we 're engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we're engaged?!
Twice.
Hey!  Well...?
No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
I can't believe Chandler is missing this!
Oh please, can 't I come to your special, magical cabin?
Yeah!
Blueberry it is.
Nuh-uh.
Shh!  Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey!  Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
Celebrities I 'm allowed to sleep with.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.
So then if-if -I mean if you think about it, this is all  your fault.
Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?
And I too am just a love machine.
Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!
It was ok...
Ohh! Thank you.
Oh yeah, it's a good idea!
The test is ready.
That 's what?!
Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, you 've been a little short with me lately. I'm not trying to irritate you.
Excuse me sir, you've got a little something right here.
Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.
Nice, put it with the others.
Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.
Oh-oh, wait, my mother is gonna be here any minute. And she has the keys.
Well, umm, why don 't you give him a call?
I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
I didn 't get the annulment.
I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so... normal.
Sweetie, don 't worry you'll get picked. Chandler.
Don 't be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it's too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.
Nice to see you again Dr. Green.
Yes! Yes, you 're gonna be so missed.
I do not always have to be -okay, okay.
There isn't that's what I'm saying.
Sure. Sure. Look I don 't, I don't know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.
You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!
So you do know a little English.
You don 't have a valid driver 's license-Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
Hey Rach!
Are you jealous?
So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about, Ernie 's at 9 o'clock?
Why? What-what else could it be?
You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp!  Ah!! That thing gets hot!!
Really girls, not cool.
Okay?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn 't count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.
Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn 't work past it together...
An egg?
Ma, you 're asking me to marry you?
Please hurry.
Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space.
No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
That only took me an hour.
Yeah, yeah. You should come check us out. We're called "Way! No Way!".
Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.
So what are you gonna do?
We're not alone.
Let 's do the card!
We need more cards.
Uh-hmm -Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona.
You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.
Hello!
I know-
Really.
Do you say this stuff to girls?
Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said,  "No." I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, "No." I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, "No." So, he's sweeping.
I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out.
What did you do to my mom?
Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister 's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?  This isn't right.
Yeah. She -Well, she's one crazy lady?
Yeah, but I 'm your brother. We're family. That's the most important thing in the world.
Also an island.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily,  honey, okay?
Why 'd you say no?
Practical jokes.
That 's correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when the baby makes this sound?
Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you.
Uh we-we need to talk.
I'm ok.
Okay! Okay! Okay! It 's okay.  It's okay. Hey, it's too weird for you, I won't see her again.
She doesn't know what to say!
Huh.
Same difference.
Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasn 't true?!
You 've seen it, the Geller Yeller.
Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!
Why are you mad at me?
Is this about Mark?
That 's not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.
Why not? It 's built into the price of the room.
Uh, oh-oh, no you didn 't. I did.
Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides.  I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight.  I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.  I would make a good cowboy.
Hey!
So we're a little late.
But you know what, if you think about it, it actually promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... juicy doubles.
There 's this kid in my class who said he's in love with me.
I'll have whatever Christine is having.
Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah.
Carol, what's the matter? What happened?
And why do you care so much?
I 'm not gonna hit you.
When Monica was a little girl, I remember that --Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
Oh, do you, do you really?
That 's a little clearer.
Stupid balls are in the way.
What?
Okay.
Sorry.
Hey, how was the Met?
Hey!
Oh, that's right!  Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?
Great! Because Emily and I are getting married in a month!
Oh yeah! Then how come you didn 't get the Geller Cup?
Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes.
Damn, I forgot you were here.
Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler  brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.
You don 't know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!
Not for the next few minutes.
Hi!
Can I use.. either thumb?
Wow! I could've died tonight.
Who is he?
Hungry monkey!  Haaa!  I 'd like a Wicked Wango card!
I don't see why not.
I was thinking more like a hundred.
I am, uh, I am...
Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.
Hey everybody!
I could, yeah, I can do that.
It 's a little early to be drinkin'.
This is it. Unless we're on a break.
Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
Okay, good luck
Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another.
Yes.
Well umm, y 'know, I used to play.
You're really not coming back?
What?
Yeah, yeah I mean, you get your money and you learn a little something, what's wrong with that?
Well hey! What's going on? Ooh, cool boat--Oh, no.   Hey, did you, did you tell them?
Put it back exactly where you found it?
Yeah, but, but look what I'm...
I take it.
Okay.
What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.
Hey, what 's going on?
Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it!
Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride.
Uh, uh... Sure! Uhm...  "Dear..."
Gentlemen, you 're pick.
Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.
What 's up?
Dude, I wanted him to guess.
OK, turn around.  I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.
Who cares, AND?
You really thought "Science Boy" was worth saving!
No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?
Sorry-sorry Jill.
Hey.
Well, I 'm-I'm just glad I could, y'know, help you out.
Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a good idea. In fact, I think he's dead.
Hey! Uh, Phoebe 's not here is she?
Yes, second in two years. Third overall.
Yeah!
That was me.
Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.
Yeah, I'm gonna go after her.
Good luck!
Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.
No, it 's a concept!
Yes.
Yeah.
To wear in front of people?
Well that I can believe.
Excuse me, what?
Hi.
Uh Dad, Emma 's in the nursery. I'll take you now. If you want, but  I really want to talk to you.
Excellent!
Well uh, y 'know what? Even if she doesn't know anything, I do! I have a son. And his mother and I didn't live together, and whenever he was with me I took care of him all the time, by myself.
Well, technically it seven billion years ago
Umm, Delilah.
No.
Thank you.
You're gonna be an aunt.
Well now let 's-let's look at this objectively, I think I should date her
Okay.
No.
Does she.
Pheebs!
Then where the hell have you been?!
Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?
It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!
So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?
No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!
Oh, she isn 't home.
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.
Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
Really? That okay, that 's great.
He left that.
Excellent!
If you have to call me name, I prefer  "Ross the Divorcer". It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry.
I don 't have too. I can just look at you.
Hi?
Me? No.
No!
So I guess we 're back to uh, Baby Girl.
Wait, wait, wait.
What?
Oh, but-but it is, uh, it 's just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
Open with a joke? It 's a university, not a comedy club!
Well, these. These are yours right here.
Yes let 's. Y'know what? Uh, it's-it's not important. What is important is that, is that we're having a baby. And it's not-Doesn't matter who came on to who.
Bye, Nana.
I was talking to myself! You 're going down!
So I don 't wanna be just anybody.
Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out.  We will, we will, call you back!
Hi.
What?
All right, see you guys.
Who 's that?
What 's-what's going on?
It-it 's great to meet you Paul.
Yeah, they don 't like you.
Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?
Who isn't?
Oh, whatever.
Wow, hello! You look great!
Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
The sex?  Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya , yaw...
Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.
Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency.
Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know what's going on.
Oh.
Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!
Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn 't actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
Hi! Hello!
Hello!!
Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are
She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.
Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it.  Okay Rach,  that's you. That's the couch.
Good, good, good. So, is uh, was your moustache, did, used to be different?
Woah, ho-ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon?
How rude.
You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising.
Yeah, which was nice.
It's not bad.
Oh, forget it, okay?
We 're just gonna be friends.
Hey guys.
Oh, that's not cool.
Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?
No.
I can 't believe in four weeks they're gonna be married!
You're livin' the dream.
I'm sorry... we... we can't.
C'mon! This looks good!
Ya know, maybe, maybe I should just go.
What's - what's going on?
Who cares? I repel women.
Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it 's not funny!
That 's no problem.
Joey, I 'm not worried about her! I'm worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this  actor taking them?
So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?
Oh.
I 'm a professor here uh, Ross Geller.
Why does she keep making that noise?
Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
She wants me to move to London.
Joshua guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kinda y'know.
A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!
Oh, I-I don 't think there's any trail.
Can I ask you somethin'?
Yeah, if you 're really hungry.  It was a joke, I made a joke.
No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. It 's how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.
I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe!
Mon?
She's gone.
Look, it 's just did, did you ever go to a party and think, "Would really anyone miss me if I weren 't here?"
If you want to check your email, just ask!
I-I-I...
Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again.
Yeah. Uh, uh we promised we weren 't gonna tell anybody this but uh, about a month ago Rachel and I slept together.
She's talking.
Yeah.
Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff.  But who cares?! Because it's all on me!   That is, one big drink!
What?
Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...
You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round begins -stop it -now. What was Monica's nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
I had a problem.
Yeah. It would 've been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily.
Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
Ohhh.
Yeah?
We're late too!
Space is filled with orbiting children.  Look, please, just come on, you know, when you 'll see the look on Emma's face, I swear you won't regret it.
No!
The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it 's time to light the Hanukkah candles!
Some days it's all I can think about.
Her date tipped me ten dollars.
Long story, honey.
No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I 'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore.
Oh my God.
Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.
Mary-Angela.
Right.
Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?
I see. You didn't happen to tell
Fine.
Gandolf the wizard.  Hello! Didn 't you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?
Exactly, it 'll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.
Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...
No, they're not.
What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me signals all over the place!
It could happen.
Oh yeah, I 'd love that.
That's worse than no food.
My wife 's a lesbian.
Nope! Something else.
Okay.   I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay?
And that 's not against your oath?!
I thought that was just a rumour.
It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!
Perhaps. Now I 'm curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?
Okay, it 's not, it's not.
Uh, before we do uh, are any of Joey 's special romance magazines in there?
Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance!
It 's a girl! Anyway, it wou-it wouldn't matter. Okay? Because I'm a teacher and she 's a student.
Ok, cut! Great. That was... that was just... yeah!
What? Are you going back to work?
All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.
Uh, Eddie something. He just met him.
that you actually
And, I love you!!
Look, I 'm sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don 't want to be divorced three times.
No tongue.
Yeah?
It's the only possibility, Phoebe.
All right.
I, I know it's big, I just didn't know it was uh, ha-ha big.
Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
What?
Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm, I 've been thinking, I'm just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.
I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Yes!
Oh stop.
Be-caaauuuse...
What?  So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It 's been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.
See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said.
I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.
Ok.
Ooooohhh.
Order a pizza like,  'I forgive you?'
I chose those, I 'm a paleontologist.
Chandler-
King?
Why don't you use your Thesaurus?
Oh yeah!
Dude. You're married to my sister.
No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.
Well let there -what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, "You ride this bike or I'll sh I'll shoot you."
So, um... where did Paolo come from?
Hey! It 's starting to snow.
Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area,  'cause if you are I'd love to show you around sometime.
B, B, B, B, B!
Absolutely.  So, twins... hah! That's like two births.  Ouch.
How could you not tell us?
Okey-dokey!
So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn 't a mistake. Ahh, there's-there's limited seating in the hall.
I need juice! People need juice!!
Get out!
Okay.  Hop on Gert.
Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time for this.
Hi.
A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that?
How, how, um how can you not be going?
Is everything okay?
Mind if I mute?
It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.
Right.
Well then a small one!! Listen, let 's, we kinda have to get going!
What?
Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn 't go well but it really did go well?
Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!
Phoebe, forget it, okay? Newark is - is like an hour away. There's no way we're gonna make it in time.
No, I, I only know Lipson.
Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room.
Yes!
Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They 're mean and they're stupid and-and I don't want my son learning them!
Yeah.
Mm-Hmm.
Yeah, okay.
But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?
Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.
Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.
Eh-wh -Excuse me?
So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh is he still in love with her?
I'm smarter than him!
How did you know she would buy scotch tape?
How do you know? You don't have a watch.
Me too. So much for my dinosaur/Amelia Earhart theme park.
It 's not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I
Yeah?
I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what, she- she happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um, whole head shaving idea, and now, who was it? Oh, that 's right, that's right, it was you!
Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.
Yeah, I 'll get right on that.
Hi!  What... . Please tell me those are clip-ons.
Oh, so sorry man! Sorry!
Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.
Hey, Missy...
Get out.
Hey!
No, hey-hey, come on,  Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!
It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!
Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!
Fine.
Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!
Yeah... I guess. I don't -I don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK?
The woman just vanished!
Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.
Uh, just a sec dad.
Oh, why don 't you make her one of your little jokes.
Yeah.
Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.
Nothing, it 's just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one.
I don't know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy!
Okay, have fun! Wooo!!
No, not a problem.
Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!
Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.
Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
Yeah, losers talk!
I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
Hey.
That must be our alcohol and beers!
Oh great, I live on the street.

And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
Here we go.  Y 'know, I've-I've never played my stuff for anyone before, so it's important that-that you understand it's about communicating very private emotions.  Y'know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That's what I'm
No!  No!
Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?
Okay!   Hey!
Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
Because you sent away the dog!
Yeah, like I could lose it.
Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I?
Ross!
Okay, that 's it, I can't take it anymore.
Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...
Look, I do not re-love her.
I just, I don 't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?
How can you not believe in evolution?
Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out.
Oh my God!
Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?
Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal.
Oh, you and me?
Hey. We-we look we look pretty good.
Ok...
Oh-ooh!
Your not going.
Heavy thing, not getting lighter!
The one that always stares at me when I come in?
Okay.
Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.
Dad, you really don't want to do that.
Thank you!
Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!
Hey -Ooh! What's-what's that, dinner stuff? You making dinner?
Oh my God, wh-what happened?
So Joey, you okay?
No-no-no-no-no.
Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?
You are way off, pal.
Hey Janice!
It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize.
Rachel?
Come on that 's not fair! I mean you haven't even heard me play!
Oh come on!!
The big deal is I don 't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle-beer! Cold beer.
It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.
Oh, you could just go uh,  " greatest of ease  BAH-bah-bha-bhannn. " Then go right into it.
Hold on.
Oh damn!
Oh my God, we did it!
Why? Did you write it?
It 's nothing, I just gave her a hug.
Yeah! I know! It was. Oh the only sad thing is I wasn't around when it happened for the first time.
You want me to call her right now?
Hey!
That-that-that 's all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I'll be right out here.  She's just fixing her makeup.
We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it 's almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?
Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera.
Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad,  Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym  Oooh, my rock polisher!
Yes you did, gleba is a word!
Yeah. You, uh, you want some?
Howard?
Aww, Pheeb, come on isn 't there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?
Hey! What 's up?
Yeah.
Hey!
Sorry, I 'm sorry. Close, close, close...
Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher?
Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.
C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...
Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best.
And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is life without love?
No! Pick me! I don 't want to end up an old maid!
Hey, Pheebs.
Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
You got ink on your lip.
Yeah.
Nu-uh!
Hi!
I got it.   So hi, I 'm uh, I'm Ross and this is my friend Chandler.
Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer.
Look Rach I-I 'm sorry, okay? I I was a stupid kid, okay? The only reason I joined
Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you guys.
Hey, Pheebs! Hi!
You too! What are the odds?
It's the dog.
I gotta go make a fake Ben.
Sure, do whatever you want.
I'm getting married, to..day!!
Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone   when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says
Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one 's not really our fault.
Hey!  Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner.  Uh, yeah, sure uh hold on.  She wants to say hi.  Hold on.
Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits for you to give up and then
Absolutely.
Not nice enough.
What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
O is for "oh, wow!" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.
We're good.
What do you mean "no"? I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay.
Hey!
Hey, hi, hi!
What?
Because it's a special hat.
Oh, yeah, no problems. It 's all taken care of.
No, 19.
This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?
Pepper?
There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired.
I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.
Sure.
Nah.
Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
It's my joke.
Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? 'Cause if are please, tell me what it is I did!
You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie.  Was there a second of all?
Maybe I should open a divorced men 's club.
OH! SON OF A BITCH!
Yeah, it kinda grows on you.  Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.
Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!
Hey!
Nope, nope, that's it.
Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.
You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!
You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
Yeah?
Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!
Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do. I mean I wish I were a seahorse.  Because with seahorses it 's the male, they carry the babies. And then also umm, I'd be far away in the sea.
Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we 'd be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn't meant to be.
Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?
Not there.
Are you kidding?!
Hey, y 'know what and if you're looking for a place? I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.
Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone?
After one class? I don 't think so.
Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?
Y'know, hey! You 're the one who ended it, remember?
What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?
I know what you mean, I 've always wondered how different my life would be if-if I'd never gotten divorced.
Joey, had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
So let 's decide on the spending limit
Hi Gunther.
What?
Emma.
Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel?  Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? It 's not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!!
And have you .. ed?
Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
Hey, hey, it's me. Why can't you tell me?
Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
I went to Egypt with my dad.
What? What?
Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want.
Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin.
Wow.
My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance -karate lessons.
Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.
No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?
I'm an eight!
Look...
Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I 'm gonna be out with her all night.
I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it.
That cup is mine!
Here  So this was fun!
I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.
Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Okay, it 's coffee.
What?!
Yeah, right!
Hi!
Uh actually Joey, it 's the Cretasous period.
Twice.
Is it? Feels like two.
Get out of the cab!
What time?
I'll make some calls.
Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way. You 'll-you're gonna pick it up.  Hey! You will! Uh look, y'know when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddy's credit card. Do you remember?
I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.
Yeah? Sometimes it's
No. I 'm saying it's now.
Yes!! Yes!!!
Women really want this?
We uh, we just cooked it up.
That 's correct. Ladies?
Ohh, you can see them, huh?
What?
Oh, okay.
Is there somebody else?
We are having a baby together, but we 're not involved.  I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while ago, but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night.  Or, yes stranger, we'd like this delivered please.
Ahh, whoo-hoo!!(He runs back out the door.
I knew it. So, is she someone from work?
You know my birthday.
Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?
Umm
Linen closet.
I don 't know what to say, I'm sorry. Though, you're not supposed to take these.  It's like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?
So listen uh, I know you and I haven 't really had a chance to talk since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were.
I think it means he freaked out and left!
This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole  "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?
I'm dead and no one cares?

Forget it. I-I -Y'know what? I'll just have the conversation. I'll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best. What do you think Rach?
Y!
God, do you realize in ten years we 're gonna be 40?
You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You...you break the
Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
Not like this!
Hey, if that 's what you want to do I'm not gonna say no.
What, that wasn 't the great news?
No, she was definitely on my bed.

....and....
Nooo!
Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.
You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.
Who 's this little guy?
O-kay... I mean, don't I deserve anything? I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug?  NOT FROM YOU!
Yeah! Rach?
Well, I'm off to Carol's.
Thanks guys!  I really appreciate this, y 'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.
Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about
Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!
Yeah?
All right, here 's the ring.
Oh!
Always a great way to get in a man 's pants.
I don't get a goodbye?
Rach, he 's not an ex-con.
Yeah, you didn 't expect her to live there with a baby did you?
Show me where?
Hi roomie!
Good night.
Hero, I uh, I don 't know-well, all right.
Man, look at all those stars!  Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesn 't it?
I am so gonna score.
Umm say, I-I opened this earlier  but let me give you guys some privacy.
Fine, then why didn't you say something?
I'm pretty sure that it is...
Is uh, is Monica here?
Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
Oh! Yeah.
You don 't think it's a little crazy that you get all my points just 'cause you
So you took off my pants and shoes?
I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
Yes, but also  Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
You're nose is bleeding!
Green. To the green.
Dr. Green. How are you?
No, we 're not!!
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!
Good! That 's good!
Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.
Oh come on, not again.
You don 't-you don't want to hear about my dream Officer Pretty?
Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I really wish that you wouldn 't.
Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!
OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
Joey-
Just ah just put roommate.
Well, I said it loud.
Right, they are scary.  Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
Thanks!
Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?
It's what you want. You should go.
What?
Yeah?
Yes!
Ohh. . . Thanks Rach, goodnight.
What? Hey, hey, listen..
I would say that.
Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.
Oh my god.
I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in  Actually, thanks!
...I hate waste.
You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.
This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then
Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews  And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with.
Hi.
Hey, what's goin' on?
I'm sorry, I was an idiot.
That's romantic.
Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
Uh Rach
Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air
Is everything okay?
Yeah. Why?
Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? It 's a button down, like a, like a faded salmon?
Well then we 'd be in a lot of trouble, you don't know where any countries are.  Okay.  Uh, say would you umm Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have  opened up?
Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.
No, no, we want to wait, right?
It 's a legitimate learning technique.  Wow!
Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.
What, you didn 't get it? The doctor is a monkey.
Ow! Ow! Oh, no-no-no!
Ah, we 're out. I sold them all.
You got me a cola drink?
What?! Look, we 're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
Thank you.
Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.
I 'm good. I'm good.
Rachel!
Okay, okay, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two, right?
Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
Hey! So what's the big news you had us rush all the way over here for?
And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
Is that Mark?
Why does everyone keep saying that?
"A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet." -- How did you know?
Let me see! Show them!
Oh.
Yeah, what, what was I thinking?
Pop it in.
What?! Why?
Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.
Yeah.
Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow.
So I 'm gonna take off then!
Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.
Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
Oh my God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!
Hey!
What thing?
Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.
In-in three minutes.
I'm gonna get some more coffee.
Totally.
Doorknob! Doorknob!
Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out.
Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.
There 's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
Is-isn 't it the best?
So?
Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?
No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?
Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK?
Okay. Um is he a good guy?
Monica 's pregnant!
Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to know that I 'm changing your grade back.
Wow. Umm Huh I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up?
With my child.
What about the chairs?
Nothing I do means anything, really.
Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!
Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe-  ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.
Hey.
Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh,   "Dude, don't you ever was your face?"
Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people.
Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or... Oh, oh. . No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea.
Hey! You were so right!
I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!
co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love with you. Obviously I didn't handle it very well. But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.
Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily.  My God, think of the massacre.
For what?
Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?
Oh no! Hey-hey, I 'm the guy! I'll get it.
Not since my cop-show got cancelled.
Yeah, see, I don 't think it's gonna that difficult considering this one won 't be taking place in the basement of a Pizza Hut.
You chipped in?!
Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I didn 't even watch it! Anyway, here.  I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself.
What, the word hi?
Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.
Anyway. That 's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.
Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
What's she look like?
Okay,  this play, I want you to do a down and out to the right. Okay. Break!
I swear to God...!
Shut up! I Dream of Genie!
Ok.
Oh yeah -No-You're welcome. We'll talk about it later.
I think it's insane.
My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.
Uh, in her defense, she 's right. I am stronger. I would destroy you.
Uh, what?
That's ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!
Oh, come on! Come on!
Oh my God. I mean
No, Susan's gonna be there too. We've got dads, we've got lesbians, the whole parenting team.
Okay.  You can feel all the bones in your skull.
Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16.  I 'm okay.
Okay!! Okay!!
Oh fine.
Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit.
Oh! Oh-oh, the band 's ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says-I don't care about the stupid band!!
What?!
Yeah.
Monica!
Yes. Yes. Don 't worry. Everything's fine. We'll uh, we'll see you tomorrow at the wedding.
I'm up for tenure.
Yeah! Good for you Joe!
And yet somehow it 's true!
No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.
Really, it would be good for you and in fact, why don't you, why don't you go ahead to the restaurant and I will wait for my mom and then I'll meet you there.
And on your anniversary, for shame!
The eyes did still sparkle.
That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.
You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat.
Oh yeah! Wasn 't she uh
Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
Why not?
Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.
Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven 't gotten it.
2 hours, 27 minutes.
Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?
Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is
Okay.
You know what I like most about him, though?
Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you  'til you cried?  We're probably too old to do that now.
We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?
Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
Rach, we gotta go.
WHAT? WHERE? WHERE?
So, I 'll umm...
Probably shouldn 't touch me.
You know what, I think we've had all the bad luck we're going to have.
Here it comes.
You've had feelings for me?
I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
Who needs a lease when it's family!
I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!
Phoebe? Phoebe?
I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.
I don 't know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.
Ah, Rachel I guess.
Oh, no, I didn 't mean, uh
Maybe it 's uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more!
Really?! I mean, really?!!
Hi!
Is that supposed to be an insult?
Yeah? Hop on.  Is the pretty lady looking?
Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
Okay.
She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.
Are you trying to get me to bribe you?
So, uh, how's she doing?
Hey.
Where's Rach?
Know what -If somebody doesn't tell me what's going on right now
Eh, you got a spray-on tan?
He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I 'm stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I've got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.
Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.
Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.
Yeah, and I was really hoping that I could hang out. What do you feel like doing?
I-I, did that for you.
No I don 't.
Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex- husband 's gonna say that stuff. Now, if you'll excuse me
Yeah, Susan.
Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
What?
No, it 's really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.
Hey!
Ohh
Come on, it's fun!

Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.
A basket of mini-muffins.
Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?
You-you 're gonna get married?! I mean We're gonna be brothers-in- law!
What-what do you mean?
Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.
Bodington's! Woohoo!
All right.
Oh! No-n-
Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one.
I can't get enough dinosaurs!
Monica? You're Mom.
It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?
Hi.
We can still catch that Ukrainian film.
Good.
Ahh, no.
We 're still married! Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
Hey.
Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?
I got it.
Oh, I 'll have some!
Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?
Thirty seconds, all the questions you can answer.
Pretty soon I guess.
well then I didn't need to bother you or the four other Mike Hanagens I bothered.
So five of us is, $33.50 apiece.
Okay. You know that I-I have to go.
No, no.  I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I'm pretty comfortable with the whole situation.
I did not freak out.
Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.
Yes, exactly!
Gunther?!
Come on, don't do this.
Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
Okay.
It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?
Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor 's appointment.
Huh?
I'm, I'm okay.
Give me the bag.
Well, you have fun tonight.
No, she kept kicking me away!
Umm
Yeah, oh and Sarah... I'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, Professor Wheeler, a-and this is Joey Tribbiani.
Oh, no no, I am.
Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils?
Y'know what I didn 't wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You're not my girlfriend anymore so...
You like that do ya?
It 's not a club.
Give me the bag.
Yeah?
Hello.
But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.
Look, I 'm sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs.
No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?
Toilet paper?
You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.
Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together.
How 'bout from now on we just call it the 'unfortunate incident'?
Oh! Oh my God! I didn 't even see you!
Sweetie that 's it.
Who is Maria?
I 'm telling you. I'm telling you. That's what it is. No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn't say anything to you?
Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.
No! No! It 's wrong! It's-it's-it's naughty. It's taboo.
FOOTBALL!
So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?
The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.
Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
Oh, okay. What-what about?
So, uh, he's back.
Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.
Uh sure, sure.
It does not!
I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now, Joe!
It 's just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around.
So, what's going on now?
All right, that 's it!  Come-you-no! You are in big trouble young man!
Yeah!!
I 'm gonna call after you!
I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it.
Are you kidding?
And I 'm sure you're gonna make a big impression. Hi! I'm Rachel Green. It's nice to meet you.  Come on, you probably have a broken rib!
It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
You do Pheebs?
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? It 's Rachel's tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.
Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl 's bodies, waking up next to people you don't even know
What? Of course you can! Hop on!
Come on, come on, we 're-we're-we're lighting the candles!
Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
It is! It is!
Easy.
Who 's that?
Not on the ones we sent out.
Just three?! I 'm dilated three!
Okay, bye-bye.
Ross.
Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven 't done that since I was four and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.
Yeah, I 'll take some.
No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .
Yes.
You mean, we -you and me?
And; people thinking it 's huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.  Which we are not!
The actress!
What?
I 'm gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!
Mrs. Bing.
Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
Well, I tell you what. Why don 't we uh, why don't we just stay here? Let's not see a movie, we'll just hang.
Chandler!!! Chandler!!!  Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing.
Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?
Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!
Yeah, you didn 't get one.
It 's not a library...
Respectfully, professor R. Geller.  Hey!
I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There 's a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.
So you two are really serious?!
Forget it, she 's destroying it.
You got it! . All right, she's right, we gotta get serious.  Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!
Ohh.  Hi!
Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
Hey Mon!
I'm here.
I will, I will find him.
No.
Got me.
You really serve people sneezers?
Who wants to make some long distance calls?
Well, they painted over the word  'Sapien' for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let's just leave it at that.
Yeah, me too.
I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
Yeah.
What's going on?
Hi!
No, but it 's-it's-it's hot!
Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.
Oh no.
Hi Jill.
Who am I?
Okay.
What?! What is with everybody? It 's Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!
What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco.
Those are the pacts!
Look, Chandler, it 's my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don't print the name, so it doesn't really matter who gets credit, right?
You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?
What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?
Good luck!
I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn 't tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend.
What-what-what the -how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the  "Paleontology Review"! Yeah! That'll be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious questions about my work!
Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
Hmm? Oh, yeah.
Okay! All clear!
You were backpacking across Western Europe?
Y 'know what? I-I-I I-I have had enough of this! Y'know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you've got a problem with me, frankly
We know!
Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?
Because , it's weird!
Yes it is. See.
Actually, no, we 're not.
Okay look, there 's nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time. There's a great baby furniture store on west 10th. Tomorrow, we will go there and we will get you everything that you need. Okay?
Why-why can 't you take a couple of days off?
Pride.
My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I 'm sorry.
Oh, you have to call the police! That 's what I did to the kids in my building!
Ok, odd thing to get excited about!
Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling,  "I'm gay! I'm gay!" Can I bring her in?
I know.
Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.
Sorry.
None.
I 'm sorry, I've got plans with my sister.
I'm Ross, Phoebe's friend from the coffeehouse.
I won 't date. I'll uh, I'll be here, with you, all the time.
I love this.
You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.
Phoebe.
Yeah, the phone was facing the other way.  And that goes back up there.
Okay, I 'll just wait for him in here!
Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there 's a bug in my food.
Either that or my mouth is getting smaller.
Phoebe that 's not true.
Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma.
You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.
Yeah, but it didn 't fit. Well, luckily there's a store here that has one left in her size, but I'm the groom, I'm not supposed to see the dress
The bathroom?
Come on, who are we kidding? I 'm doody. Please? She's watchin'.
Oh, right, because he's a scientist!
Hey, wanna wanna a little cheering up?
No, no, with him.  I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.
No, no you don't understand the animal hospital is way across town he's choking I don't know what else to do.
Oh.
Thanks again, Dr. Green.
See? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. I've met him before?
I 'm not proving anything. Okay, I'm done listening to you. If I hadn't let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would've put my fist through the wall!
Happy too.
That money is mine, Green!
Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I 'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.
Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?
It hurts my teeth.
Yeah.
We 're not gonna do that.
Well, if what 's in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it's-it's get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it's just milk.
Oh yeah, yeah we 're moving forward. You'll be getting our card!
I don 't know what to say.
Like  'em, like 'em? Or, I'd like to get store credit for that amount like 'em?
What, that we had a baby? Come on let 's give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.
When you put a  'D' at the end of 'Fine' you're not fine.
Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!
How sad are we?
Fine, you go.
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
No, no!
Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
I can 't believe he didn't come!
Way to go, Phoebe!
Hey everyone!
Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?
Oh it 's okay. They're just-they're just wrapping her up.
What?
Huh?
Ever?!
Yes. Yes. Yes.
They 're not listening too me?
You got it.
I can 't believe someone would do that for a grade.
Ok.
Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay, clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?
Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean... uh, did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me?
Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision?  I'm actually asking you!
Hello?
Okay, I think I got it.
What?
Hey, you guys... I have great news.
Ohh, I just like the smell.  Mmmm.
Yeah, yeah, it 'll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?
All right, look, look, you 've got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
Hey Chandler.  Monica!
Rachel, this is your apartment.
Well, yeah.
Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
Yeah.
I am a good kisser.
We are even, right?
Aaawwwwww!!
Okay!
Hey.
Hey, you ok?
That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!
Look, don 't worry. Okay? You're gonna be fine.
Okay, okay, what's going on?
Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?

Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
Okay!
Chandler 's gonna ask Monica to marry him!
I know!  Don't switch hands, okay?
It's me. Ron.  Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back.
That was different!
Because! Because, it-it-it 's It'd be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don 't ride it you-you're-you're killing its spirit!  The bike is dying.
Yeah?
Y 'know what would cheer you up?
Come here.  Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee.
No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, I 'm sure we won't get arrested for this.
Well yeah!
I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we 've been through, I just-y'know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.
Ehm... Her name is Emma.
I'm still hungry!
I don't know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?
That bad?
.....Hi.
You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.
No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn 't work either, I can't tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...
Why- why are you here, Carol?
It's not the same.
Don 't ask me, I had it and I blew it!
That 's my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!
Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?
What?
Emily is incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it, I mean the whole weekend was like a dream.  Oh! And you! Rach!
Well I don 't know, but how-how great would that be huh? You living in my building. I could help take care of the baby. I can come over whenever I want.  With your permission.
No
Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
Yeah!
Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!
Yes!! I knew it!!  Bye-bye! So long! Later!
I don't know. It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right. When I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go. You know what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together.
Yeah, but I got cous-cous!
All right here. Watch me execute the three  'P's of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache.
Thanks you guys.
No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would 've just stepped aside.
No they don 't!!!  Well they should put it in huge black letters!!!!
I don't know what... you're talking about.
I can 't believe this!!
Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch.  Okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail isn't going around any more.  What time is it? It's 7
What the hell are doing?!!
I know if you were getting married I 'd feel, kinda .. y'know.
Well, what happened?
Of course he is! What, do you think I 'd just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can 't date. It's against the rules. It's forbidden.
No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.
I'm going to uh I'm going to, um, put the bourbon in it at home.
Oh, I 'm sorry you've been Bamboozled! You're gonna be a terrible mother!  I've lost sight of why we're doing this!
Okay.
Hey Pheebs, you know I'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the other day and I hope I was a little helpful.
All right, let 's not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.
Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.
Okay here, have one of these peppers. Oh ha Oh God! So so hot!  Oh my- By the way, you don't want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye.
Yeah!!!
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Bye, Richard.
Pheebs you uh you do know how to ride a bike don't you?
And then Rachel wasn't sure she could leave the baby.
Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it 's a sickness really.
What?!
Well, start looking.
Oh my God!
Well we-we don 't know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this.  Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that's uh, that's all for today.  Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?
Ok, good night!
Hey.
Oh thank God, I thought she had two heads.
On account of my rage.
Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I 'm not invited to sleep-overs.
I 'm sorry.
No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?
I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?
That 's okay.
Monday?!
Then what am I supposed to do?
In the death seat?!!
Hey!
And somebody took a shot at me!
Oh no! It could be better, but it 's gonna be okay, right?
What a weird way to kick me when I 'm down.
E!
He hasn 't gotten out of that chair in two days.
Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the... Okay, you're dialing, you are dialing.
What?
I don't know.
Great! Well umm
Again, very sorry.
Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..
I don 't know what you're talking about.
Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!
What's the part, Anti-man?
Uh, I actually haven 't even met him.
Phoebe, you can 't get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!
Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right!  This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.
Oh, I 'm sure.
Probably around gonorrhea.
It-it -The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
Okay! You take care!
I 'm sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I-look, I just want you guys to be safe.  DANGER!!!!!  Ahhh, huh? Unagi.
Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.
Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract  Well, why are you laughing?
Rachel...
Joe I 'm not kidding
This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way.
I don 't know if it's true.
Hey.
Right, is it painful?
Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....
What guys? Oh, yeah.
My first time with Carol was...
Yeah, we 're done.
Look, I-I know it 's not a proposal and I don't know where you are, but with everything that's been going on and with Emma and I've been feeling
Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh?
Hi, Alan.
I 'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
It 's not something you are! It's something you have!
Ezels!!
No, that 's, no, as long as you're okay. So I'll ah, I'll see you tomorrow.
Now I cannot wait to see this.
Okay.
A pigeon, a pigeon.  No, no wait, no-no, an eagle flew in. Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird's aid. The eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon. Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still up lays  are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the apartment.
Why no, it 's the opposite of weird. It's-it's uh, regular. It's-it's uh, it's mundane. It's actually uh, a little dull.
Bye.
Aw come on, Mona Lisa?
So does-does Joey know you 're moving?
Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
Great! Uh, let me take this up for you.
Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y 'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles
No, I 'm not gonna pick them up.
Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer?  I'm fine, I'm fine.
We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.
No-no-no, I 'm saying we-we buy more of this  at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else's faces.
So you were right?
What the hell are doing?!!
I love you.
Why?
Veto.
Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.
Wow!!
What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.
Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn 't as bad as-as
Oh,  Believe me, the ladies, they love it!
What are you doing here?!
No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing, okay? And
I don't know.
No! That's-that's my arm!
Hey!
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's just stupid.
I 'm just saying if you can't eat by yourself, how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?
You told her!
' My scones.'
Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this  genuine pterodactyl egg  replica.
I wasn't- I mean, I-
Oh, absolutely!
You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.
Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
Joey!!
She brought them up!  I didn't realize you were coming back so soon!
'Cause otherwise they'd have to call it the room room.
We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.
I Ross...
I guess so.
Oh-oh, absolutely!
Thanks!  Ugh, I can 't believe you're not gonna be there!
Hmm.
No.
The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
Oh. Okay, just breathe.
I 'm sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody's off the phone, how 'bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.
No-no, I 'm I'm sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy.
'Cause I know what you're trying to pull here. Okay? It's not gonna work.
Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!
What? I don't get a goodbye?
You really didn't know?
Right? And this!  She-she could 've won this!
I 'm gonna, I'm gonna go to London and I'm going to fight for her.
Get out!
Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.
So! Poetry? Susan 's gay! They're being gay together!
But...
Okay, I 'm sorry, this is insane! I-I-I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I 'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!
Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya.
Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?
No, I mean, look I don 't know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don't want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight.
Ah, it 's good. It's going good. I mean, we get along great. She's, she's so
Dad so what we have to pretend that we 're married?
Oh God.
Oh! You are gonna love it!  and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this.
Hey, at least you have a wife! I-I keep getting divorces and knockin ' people up! And I'm dressed as doody.
Oh my God.  Congratulations.
Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.
Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.
Okay.
Umm. Umm, I 'm-I'm just gonna-
Answer better, answer better!
Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.
Shhh.
What are you doing?
Well, I don't know....  huh-huh.... but I'm hoping  huh-huh.
First of all, I'm not losing...
I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!!
Ah, somebody 's at the door on the ceiling.
Ah yeah. Good times.
No, because that 's the right thing to do.
No, I don't think so.
You-you-you-you  threw my sandwich away!
Whip it out, whip it out.
Okay, listen I am not a pervert!
Yeah.
Hey!
Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.'
Hello! Hello!
Thank you!
Okay, I 'm going to start climb down you now.
Me neither.
Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.
You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called  "a globe?" Hmm?
is for me not to see you anymore.
No, it's just...you know the whole  "getting on with your life" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.
What-what is love really?
You know how close women can get.
No!!
So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
No-no. No.
Oh.  Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me- give me a second!
Yeah.
Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line.
Oh, you're...
Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.
Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?
All right, bye!
Rach, c'mon, Emma is fine. You're turning into an obsessive mother. Okay, you need to stop.
Oh, nothing, it 's just, it's close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?
Like uh y 'know like this! This!  She-she could've made this!
Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who...
Ohh! Ew!
Wha, OK, I'm sorry, let's uh, why don't we find someplace else.
Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.
Uh yes! Thank you.
I 'm sorry about your date.

Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.
Yeah.
What's with her?
If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
I 'm not going to do that.
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh
Hello?  Oh no! What happened?  Ok ok, where are you? . Ok, I'll be right there.
Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I 'll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
Okay. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Can I, can I help you with something?
Yeah. Yeah, it really was. But we we gotta be careful. We we can't let that happen again, y'know?
Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take  'em off and we'll have some fun.
What?
You 're good.  These are not.
Monica!
Hey.
Still sharp as a tack!
Thanks. Did you stay here all night?
Uh-huh.
Why, why would you open it?
Joey, it's worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.
I told you about my daughter.
Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.
Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.
You-you had what?
Wow! I 'm honored! And y'know what I'm gonna do as my first act as your best friend?
What?
Go over there and tell that woman the truth.
Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked.
How 's my little boy?
Oh, who? Me?
Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn 't really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it's gonna make a difference
Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!
So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.
Well, well to sum up, we 're having fun, you look young.
I just wanna clarify this
Can you say Barbados?
No!
Yeah, get out! Now!
I 'm gonna be on TV!!
That 's funny. Yeah. Y'know you're the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.

Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!
You're looking!
I'm not getting you a muffin!
Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh!
Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
I don't think so.
Happy for you.
How did he do this?
Yeah, I still don't know.  I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says,  "Kids welcome here." But that also says,  "Come here to me!"
I swear!
Go ahead.
We don't. But I thought it would be nice to get to know him. You know, maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.
Yeah, make that three.
Hey, what's wrong?
What do you mean?
Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
Okay, come on!  Daddy needs a new pair of electromagnetic microscopes for the Prehistoric Forensics Department!   Okay.  Take Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point, collect three cool points!! Yeah! Which gives me five, and let 's see who is gonna lose their clothes. Ummmm, I think I pick our strip poker sponsor Mr. Joey Tribianni.
It's breast milk.
You're kidding.
Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?
We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
Yeah. What do you think.
Is this about Mark?
No, NO!  Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it.
Bye Ryan.
Thanks, I put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift.
We'll see.
Hi!  Hey mom.
Y 'know, you're right. Thank you.
Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
Oh, thank you.  Hey, hey.  Rachel!!!!
Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.
I don't feel like having sex. Maybe we can watch a movie or something.
Stop going through my stuff !
I am good. Okay! Okay! Uh, I got the pillow! I got the bag! You got the keys?
Huh? Oh, I got this --this!
That 's funny. Umm .  It's not funny.
I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?!
I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
You talked to her?
I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.
Uh, yeah, I ah, I also need two.
Not all bad.
What should I wear, now I 'm all nervous.
Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?
N No! We took a cab too, but I did test runs!

What?
I 'm the ring bearer.
Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.
No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.
A loser you did it with  298 times!
Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.
That 's right.
Okay, hold my crawler.
Rach! Come on! Rach!
Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,
There it is...
Yeah, sure.
Look this is starting to look really bad for me. Okay? Mona, Mona 's standing right over there.  Oh God, she's talking to Joey! You gotta let me win!
Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?
What? Your-your list?
Come on, she's gonna love you guys!
I can do that.
I... I don't know..
Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.
Hi.
I find Marion 's views far to progressionist.
You wanna know how she knew him?  Because Phoebe used to mug people.
Come on, they're gonna love you.
What?
I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?
Hey, you guys! Guess what?
And!! Isabella Rosselini.
No, 19.
Yeah -No!!
Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?
Le Poo's still alive?!
Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she?
Why are they here?
I 'm understanding, but let's not get carried away.
Are we off the bridge?
All right, try pedaling.
I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.
Correct! What is Chandler Bing's job?
...Chandler!
Oh, I promise, what.
Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actually -I-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.
You know what, it 's, it's better this way anyway. I mean I don't know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. It's just much easier if we're just friends who have a kid.
What?
I do. I do. Although, it's actually a lager.
Hey!
I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's...
Yeah.
Monica knows.
Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and -Hey! I'll hold you up and-and push you. Okay?
Yeah. Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesn 't matter. I mean, I think it would've happened either way. I mean if you hadn't initiated it I-I-I know I would've.
Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
Looking up?
Oh, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry sweetie, I was just trying to ah, I'm dialing another number.
Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
Mon, look who I ran into!
I don 't know, I-I was all high.
So . . . Welcome.
Hey you.
Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.
I'm having a son. Um...
Don't make jokes now.
Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
The red one.
Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one.
And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn 't know he was in there.
Nothing, I 'm-I'm just, I'm so comfortable with you!
You don't want my opinion?
I know.
Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!
None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That's not the point. Ok? The point is you...you are the one
Thank you.
I hear ya.
Oh my god, crap from the street?
Nothing! There 's nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she'd have to uh, move here. She should move here!
What?
What?
Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we-  Sorry. Sorry.
She's doing her laundry.
Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
Alright, alright, let's do this!
Well yeah, I think we should get married.
Okay.
Uh, hi.
There's nothing you can say. That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me.
Joey, we just saw it!
Here 's your girlfriend's button.
Oohh, 23.  Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars!
Mmm-Hmm.
Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it 's going to be torn down, so I mean, I-I know it's crazy, but everything up 'til now has been so crazy, and I don't know, this just feels right. Y'know?
Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!
Permission to veto.
Why? What was wrong with her?
Y 'know, okay. You're right. It is huge. So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
Hey
It was, it was okay.
Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?
Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.
Look, they must be stopped!
That 's okay, I'll just pick 'em off.
Um, Monica and I aren 't supposed to play football.
Joey, the guy 's your best friend.
Yeah.
Who just lost the respect of her unborn child.
She doesn 't know she was fired yet, does she?
Chandler. I sensed it was you.
My son? Pretty serious.  Oh hey Katie!  What uh, what are you doing here?
What -You're not serious. I mean she's a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. She'll drive us totally crazy.
No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!
Just, just say what you feel.
Well you sure used a large font.
Mmm.
Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.
Okay, shoot!
I feel terrible.
Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What?  Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three.  Well you didn't hang up either.
No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.
Oh hey, right back at ya.
I don't think tho.
Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I 've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
Oh.
You still love me.
Uh, bigger than that.
Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I'm afraid it's not working out.
J-j-just relax, nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that you were getting better.
Okay. This stuff?
Eh? We 'll show him!
Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!
Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
Oh thanks. Although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there a little.
Rach, she 's got like three hairs!
Just Ross!
That! Let 's talk about that.
Hey!
Yeah, that 's the one. Listen, I don't want to hurt her.
This is the single greatest day of my professional career. Gunther, six glasses!
Monica. Whaddya think?
Hey roomies!
Woooo!!!
I-I know. Well if something comes up...
Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
Shhhh!
Okay.
Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
What are you doing here, Santa?
You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
Aw -oh, that's right. Are-are you gonna be okay?
Let her off the plane!
Thank God.
Yes, you can, very much.
Hey, come on in.
Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!
Well, I 'm sorry, but ah, look if you're not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?
Oh I 'll prove it! I'll prove it like a theorem!!
Umm, I don 't some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later.
Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to work. I -What?  No! Wh What are you doing?!!  GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Rachel who 's carrying my baby? Rachel?
I know nothing! Mike's a great guy, it was hypothetical!
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don 't know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?
Okay.
Awww.
Yeah?
Unless   You anticipated that I would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named Ruth! Well, I'm not falling for that! Okay? Ruth is off the table!
Okay, can we just sign please?
Wow!
All right, I 'll do it.
Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell...  Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?
I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross.
Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in Europe? Here's a question
Hi.
I think Chandler 's gone.
I 'm afraid the TV Guide comes to Chinandolor Bong.
You will?!
Okay.
See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.
My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.
Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....
That's right. The student has become the master.
What can I do, she doesn 't listen to me about renter's insurance either.
What?! No! No! Wait! You 're right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There's nothing wrong with that. Come on.  Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.
So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend.
Oh, I got it.
So you wanna watch uh, Entertainment Tonight?
Oh no!
Look, you guys, you guys should go.  No, I 'm, you, you planned this all out, and I don't want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.
Sorry. . You ok?
She already lives in London.
I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
Y 'know what? Y'know what? Rachel, just-just drop it.
Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?
I am a single parent.
Ahh, oh that's OK, I mean, he's probably got, you know, parties to go to and stuff. But, ya know, he's moved on. Hey, that, that's the way it goes right.
OK, here goes.
What?!
Help!
She hates Pottery Barn?!!
Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind.
No, no way. You've got it totally the other way around my friend. John Voit was...
Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able.  How much are the boxes?
Oh, no! No!
Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
Bye.
Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.
Come on.
Joey!
OH NO!
I want to take my tongue... and...
I just I have to find out how it went.
We met at Phoebe 's birthday party, I'm, I'm Ross Geller.
Hey.
You 're right. That's very different. So let's, let's just sign the papers. All right?  What?
I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.
Oh, now you want a favour?
Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!
Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."
Yeah, you too. Man, so-so what are you up to?
Well, they're not mine!
It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!
Look, is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her.
No!
I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life.
Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?
You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OK -if you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble.
Phoebe!
What 's up?
Ooohhhh!!
Oh, actually I haven't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages?
Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
Hi!
No one, I'm just saying if...
It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
Whoa! You were down on one knee?
Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her.
Oh, Rachel, I 'm-I'm sorry.
Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper!  Yes we 're surprised!  Who did you leave a message with?
Everyone, this is Julie.
Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.
Pheebs, if you don 't tell him, soon he's gonna be married, and then you're gonna hate yourself.
Cool!
Ugh. Well, we 're just gonna have to jump.  Yeah. Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there you go up to the roof and you let me in.
Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
No.
Where is she?
Thank you so much for that gift!
Oh my God! Those weren 't albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!
Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.
Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.
Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
No.
Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?
Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.
Ohh, these are pretty good.
Hey.
Just, y'know out.
Do they wait for me to do this?
Hi. She said yes.
Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything.
Ahhhh!!
Veto.
Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly . Molly, Chandler, Joey.
Uh no-no, she-she 's out for the night.
Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
Oh, no problem.
Hmm?  Oh, a student I don 't know.
Aw, right.
Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.
Turn.
Thanks doctor.
I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book
Uh, hello!
Tonight.
Y 'know, y'know I'm lookin' and I don't think anyone's home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y'know explain later.
No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was
Okay, I 'm gonna get your coat and then I'll-I'll put you in a cab.
I'm serious. I just don't trust that guy, okay?
That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn 't want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she's going to Florida for spring vacation.
What?!
I 've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
How come? Everybody else does.
Uh, sweetie we've gotta go.
Nobody likes change.
'Scuse us
Goodnight.
Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really would 've wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was.
Well, OK, I uh, I have to. I can't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh, y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm... I'm gonna go get a cat.
Bumpy?
Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?
Come on!
Come on, would you grow up? It 's no big deal.
Bye.
Okay.  You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
Me neither, okay? We are - we're done being stupid.
No! No!  No!  No-no-no-no.
Thank you.
Oh, good!
And the Irish guy wins the joke!
I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
Where ya goin'?
So umm, any word from Susan?
What's up?
That 's it, your doing great.
Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok.
Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon.
No, but. . .
Yeah! Oh, I-I love this babies!
Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty free".
Well it's really. . . sexy. I wouldn't have thought it would be but. . . wow.
Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, "Oh my god I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?
Dude, we are sooo gonna party!
Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don 't want to make it savory.
Hey Erica, welcome back to town!  Wow, look how big you've gotten.
I think, sub-consciously
Ah Ah Get out of here!  Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion's views on evolution?
Em-Emily?  Em-Emily?  Emily!
You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
No.
I know.
I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
No, and I'm not going to.
Oh.  Oh. Well I uh, I brought her some bloemen.
You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.
Don 't yell at me okay, this is the most I've seen you all week.
Ok.  Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
No.
What?
You ever figure out what that thing's for?
It 's been six months! I'm always hot!
I promise you she 's safe! No watch how much she loves this.
Oh, and also, he 's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know...
It really was!
Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I 'm afraid I-I had to fail you.
I 've had better.
I do too! I missed you!
That audition.
I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-
But you left.
Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
It 's just I miss her so much.
Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!
Love you guys.
What?!
Correct, his profession was?
Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something -or should I call it  football?
Focus.
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.
Hi Jill!
Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?
Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!
Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.
Female body inspector? What size is that?
Joey where 's the pipe that was holding the door open?
I mean after tomorrow night.
You wanna wander in the hall?  Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
I-I just thought you were doing so well. I
There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi  What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?
Wow.
Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?
Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you!
A hundred?! Well, I-I guess I 'll take a-Mona, uh I-I'm not sure about the whole uh, card thing.
Well uh, I-I 'm a paleontologist. Umm, I-I live in New York. I have a son Ben. Uh, hi Ben!  And uh
What are you doing?
Is Rachel here?
Hey, where 's uh, where's mom?
Uh-huh. What happened?
Yeah? Okay.
So uh, Emily called last night
No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care -I-I love Rachel.
Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...
Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?
Freaked out? Hey no, I 'm not freaked out! I'm indignant! As a consumer!
Oh, wake up!
But-but, if you don 't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time. Really, it's fine, whatever you want.
Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.
Okay!
C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.
How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that's
Oh!
I mean I I know I wanted to. I just, I just wasn't sure if you wanted to.
So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
Oh God!
Do them!!
Hey!
Fine, just stop thinking about me.
Well, John McLane had plans!
Really?
Wow!
Oh!  Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, it 's supposed to be excellent. The director is the same
It 's a rug.
I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.
There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge!
Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.
Uhh, believe me when he 's older, he'll understand.
Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.
I know, I wasn 't finished.   But don't worry! We're gonna go down the fire escape!!
Right. Good night.
No you do -y'know what, you're not gonna suck me into this.
Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?
Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.
Yeah.
Hello.
What?
I think he can be.
Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
And sexy.
Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
Yeah!!
Mom no, come on! Thank you.
These aren't suede.
You're excited, right?
You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that.
Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
Hey!
C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?
Hi!
No.
Thank you Amy.
Well, there you go.
Well, I do, so let's...  So, Ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?
What?
Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
Okay, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time.
Yep?
Hi!
With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!
What 's wrong with being the Bings?
So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just .
Okay umm, why don 't we all take a seat, y'know? And uh, and I'll get us all some uh some coffees--Yeah, why don't you.  Uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y'know? Whatever pops into your head.
Professor Neuman, the head of the department, so .
We have to stop them before something happens!
Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?
Oh my -Come here! Come here!  It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.
Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are- are my I mean, I 'm lucky to have just one good
So you 're strong enough to face her on your own?
Okay... okay, maybe I will...
If you wanna put a label on it.
And why wouldn't he get it?
Damn! I can 't believe I took her off my list.
Umm, would you like to dance?
Hello?
That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
Oh my God! You did that yourself?
No, no, that won 't be ah, that won't be necessary
Go, go, go!!
Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they 're going to the theatre together! They're going to dinner! They're going horseback riding!
Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I 've ever made.
No!
Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis.   What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me  Cheers.
What?!
Monica!
Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn 't happen!
Wh-haa-haa! Look what  'cha did!
Well sure. But I get married all the time so
No.
Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
Hi.
O-kay. Well, I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast.
Five to be lying, six.
Look, look, look.
You ah, wanted to see me?
Phoebe, I had no idea you were so conventional.
Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants.
Kristen Lang.
Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that 's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people,  so I'm allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it's flattery.
Look at you! What -You're-you're this big executive! You are much more capable than you give yourself credit for. I-I have no doubt you're gonna be an incredible mother.
Okay.
Oh, Rach...oh..."gleba" is not a word.
Well, can you blame her?
Carol our sex life is -it's just not working
Yeah -oh! Hey listen umm, Emily found this wedding dress in London
Hi. Sorry we're late but we were -well, there was touching.
I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
Okay, maybe it wasn 't my best decision. But I just couldn't face another failed marriage.
Helps a little.
Okay, I 'll see you soon buddy.  Be back in an hour.
Mike  "Gandolf" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world.
Oh, I kinda was, wasn 't I?
What?!
Oh!
Help! Help!
Hey!
Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
You 're weird today.   Listen I uh, wanted to talk to you about something.
Say something clever!  Okay, doesn 't have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words.  Any words will do.  Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever!   There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!!   I-I, I uh haven't had sex in a very long time.   Yeah, you really shouldn 't have said anything.
I can handle the stick!!
What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings.
Quack, quack..
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
You uh, you don't believe in gravity?
No, Monica 's restaurant got a horrible review in the Post.  I didn't want her to see it, so I ran around the neighborhood and bought all the copies I could find.
How you doing?
I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.
No-no, it's not that, it's just I-I just moved in.
You're wearing the same shirt.
It wasn 't the best.
So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.
Phoebe, what happened?
No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is.
All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
No. That guy is.
Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
Oh my god.  I never thought I'd see this again.  It's all here. What made you save it all these years?
That 's right! That's right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way , of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.
Uh okay, well there 's-there's wine in the kitchen.
S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?
I 'm getting that baby out of you!
No, these are my pants.
He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
Your make-up!
No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.
You like it?
Come on.
Yeah, were better off without them.
Okay, guys, wish me luck.
Hi.
All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack.
So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.
Hey, I might!
What dog? There-there's no dog here.
Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!
Rach, she's not going to remember this.
Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?
What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?
Well...  Whaa... aaah... aaahhh...
I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?
Mitzi is.....
Everything? Even the TV?
C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!
Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
ON A CAT??!!!!
I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'
What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!
Hello to the rest.
Thank you, thank you.
well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma would go to my parents.
Sweetie you 're doing great.
Oh, hey Aunt Millie.
Excuse me?
Uh Joey...
Yeah?
Yeah.
Why are we in bed together?
Hi.  It 's nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don't anymore.
Oh?
Well, can 't you at least stall her a little? I'll-I'll go back to some of the places I went last night.
Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions.
Really?!
Y 'know what? I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later. Good-bye.  Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you're just using me.
What?
Oh, all right.  Tails!  Can you-can you see what it is?
Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?
Really? That's great!
Oh! Got  'em right here,  check!
I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think.
Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
2
All right, we 're gonna play.
All right then.
Hey, here 's a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?
Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing. OK so you uh, and now wha... and now, now, now you're over me?
Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.
Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily.
Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y 'know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
My apothecary table!!!
Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.
Okay. Hut! Hike!
No! No, you know what?  You
You can totally, totally live on this.
Maybe not.
Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.
You told her before you told us?
What did it say?
Ok, here, here. There we go.
What?
Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.
Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.
Unagi. I 'm always aware.
That said it was my sandwich?!
Thanks.  Hey, I know where this place is! It used to be an X-rated video...  florist.
And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.
Ok.  B - O - S ...
Hey, let's not do this!
I can 't believe this! I shouldn't be the one making her throw up!
Look, I didn 't want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didn't want to either. But I don't, I don't understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?
You complete me kitchen, matey!
No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.
All right! I want my key back!
Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
Dad that won 't matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
What?
Hey, it 'll grow back, right? And she-she's really fun, and she's cool, and-and I'm finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel was so , y'know? Y'know, and I'm finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her, and-and-and it doesn't work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that again?
Ewwww!!
OK. Hold my board.
Damn!
No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.
I played bad on purpose guys.
I gave them to Joey.
Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I 'll-I'll tell her tonight I can't see her anymore.
Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer?  I'm fine, I'm fine.
And so now you guys are gonna be married?
Ok.
A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
Yes, please!  So, what's going on?
No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go.
Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go  "ba dum bum chessh"
Wha, uhh, what?
I sort 've already asked Chandler.
Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
Okay.  Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?
Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so...
You see Amanda and I have a very special...
Excuse me?
Really?! I mean, even with the card?
Hi.
This is my wedding.
Well then, what is it?!
Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.
Here come some more...
What? Oh yeah.  I 'm sorry. I mean I-I think I went a little crazy. I mean I was thinking about myself when I  really-I should have been thinking about you Rach
Yeah, okay.
No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help.
Umm that 's that's a little misleading.
Yeah!
Thanks.
Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?
Well I don 't know umm,  what if we were too tie each other up?  Umm, some people eat stuff off one another.  Nah! Umm, y'know we-we could try dirty talk?  Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
Do you wanna start telling secrets?
No! No! Not -I don't mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, who's umm six and I still think of him as a baby.
Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
I didn't.
I think just the annulment for today.
Why? Why can 't you go to him?
Yeah, guess so. Whew! Check these out!  Never done this before.
Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.
It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex- wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.
Your what?
Oh my God.
All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!
Oh, I know.  Y 'know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda
No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.
Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going to be.
Hey, what's behind your back?
Oh-oh, okay, okay!  If you don't mind I'm gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt.  You have a pleasant evening.
So, what do you want to do tonight? There 's a Ukrainian film at the Angelica that's supposed to be very powerful. Interested?
Hey!
Hey!
I'm hurt.
Hey!
Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it 's like uh-a thing!
Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll see if she wants to come back.
Yeah?
And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
Yeah, yeah, she's here.
Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.
Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's -Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.
No, I-I 'm saying I liked her.
Bye!
Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?  Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot.
Oh, oh there go the clothes.
No, this is pretty much it.
We were all pretty shaken up about it.
Yeah? Any names come to mind?
Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.
Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.
No I -Mona!
Rachel. Rachel Rachel.  I love you the most.
Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.
Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex- girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.
I really thought she'd stay.
With such a sad history.
I dunno, maybe it 's because you're really sarcastic. Or maybe it's cause you uh-
Hey! Everyone.
Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard
Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...
Come on.
I was saving you.
Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?
Oh, thank God!
All right.  Okay, here we go!
Ross? I... I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together last year... I had a baby with your sister!
Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
No, but, your-your mad.
Think he washed his hands?
Okay. Okay, I 'll talk to him.
Nevermind.
No-no! No-no. No-no.
Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?
You still love me?
I know.
Hi. Hi.
Um, yeah.

Well, I 'm just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.
I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension.
No, no, no. That's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.
Oh there you go!
Yeah, I mean, all things that guy...  These are amazing!
The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh, I 'll take another question.
Y 'know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system.  Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep!
Oh, well...
Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
Yeah.
Excuse me ladies.  I 'm sorry?
Nooo!
The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!
A little.
Yeah! Right!
So how'd it go?
Wha, OK, now how do you know that?
Yeah!
I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman,  "So, where is this going?"
She looks so small.
What?
Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!
No, please, please, um, it 's for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.
And it 'll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
Yeah!
What?
Well... I like how you look, what are you?
Oh yeah! You're -hey, you're right! Here's an affordable place,  two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!
Oh, really!
Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?
Yeah.
Are you kidding? Oh my God...
Look at all these paleontologists!!
It 's right there!
We-we-we -I remember being in a chapel.
Um-hmm.
And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?
Ah....
Uh-huh.  Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you.  Okay, let 's go see Monica!
Wow!
That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation.
Okay. Okay. I mean I 'll be okay. It's just I don't think I handled it very well.
My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this.   You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!
Ohh.
You're right, you're right, it is.
We have 8
One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?
That word was swans.
Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y 'know no commitment.
Correct! What is Chandler Bing 's job?
Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...
Fine, fine.  We'll have fun, won't we? Yes, we will, yes we will.
Oh, no, Mom, it 's just Monica this year.
Oh, nothin ' much. Just trying to figure out what I'm gonna do for dinner.
Pheebs, come on, you didn 't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence.
Hey?
Okay! Okay.  Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
No, not this time.  So... what'd you have?
Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?
Oh, aaaah!
What're you talkin' about?
But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have so much fun and you love Mike.
I am a doctor! Y 'know what? I'm just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.
I just found out that Elizabeth 's dad wants to meet me.
There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.
All right.
It was a dry day.
Ok ...  Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have no problem.
How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. . I just heard it as you must have heard it and that 's not good. Let me start again. I'm a paleontologist, you'll be there with us and the touching refers only to bonesÃ¢ÃÃ¦ fossils!
Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know, I'm going to take her to an amazing Valentine's dinner. Do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks I'm the best boyfriend in the world, then I'm going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.
Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did not kiss.
Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes Madeleines?
You can't go, I mean you're the glue that holds this group together!
I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.
That 'll be a neat trick, when you're,  when you're dead!
Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn 't want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can't.
Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as  'Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, 'the munchies.' So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me
What? She's gonna eat all those cookies?
Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
Oh, mine! Mine! Mine!  Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.
Hey!
Oh my God, he just said your name, that 's great! Good job Ben.
That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful
Huh?
Is this?!
Over here.
Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl's breast?
It was my first time.
Ah, and where is Joey?
Good-bye.
Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
Yeah?
He is so weird.
Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
Just one thing umm
Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do that again...
No!
Oh yeah, I'm sure he's gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary.
Ah I had a little thing with Joey, if you think this is bad you should see him.
How are you ever going to sell this place?
Dad, she won't want to go with me.
You got a job?
So were you in Nam?
You slept with my sister?
Naa.
Hey!
Yeah.
Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?
Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?
Yeah I just hurt it.
Is that so?
All right, let 's go! Bye, Pheebs!
No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?
So, what? That's it?
Hey, what 's this?!
Okay, break-up 's still on!
No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!
So bad.
I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I 've already signed everything and I put little 'X's where you need to sign.
Joey, NO!
Are you sure?
Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead.
Thanks.   Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
Sure.
I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.
Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.
Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
Oh. What 's wrong with Ross?
I 'm telling you.
Do you want me too?
Well go! Go move it!
Yeah, okay.
Yeah!
Oh God, thank you!  Umm, uh, Mr. Stevens I 'd like you to meet my friends uh, this is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.
Hey! Are you ready yet?
A-A day.
Nope.
Hey! Hi!
Rach, I think you 're reading a little too much into it.
I don't! I wanna be with her.
Oh I know, isn't it? Ooh... what'd you do to get her to laugh?
And that's, that's funny why?
Woah. Woah... <nearly really drops the plate and more seriously> Woah.
Wha...  What? What would give you that idea?
You know, we should just go, I 'm not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!
What about Emma? We don't have a nanny.
This would be the place where you explain the hat.

Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?
Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard 's son, you'd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.
One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!
Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the  "hot nanny".
The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.
Yeah?
I 'll tell you what Mon, I'll give you the first box for free.
Hey. What was that all about?
Come on!
umm. that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named Vicrum.
Still doing the screening thing?
You're welcome for a delicious dinner.
Well isn 't there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can't-can't you pick up, I don't know, an extra shift here?
Come on you guys, it's no big deal!
I'm going to do it.
Sure, you want to go upstairs?
Right, so that's a firm "no". I cannot believe this, I just keep striking out.
So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing....
And she's supposed to buy this?!
Oh no-no-no, I 'm there.
Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you \- wovyou dovyou ...
I 've got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.
Oh, no-no-no don 't you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!
Wha-? Oh, come on. You didn't have to-saltwater taffy?!  Thanks! This is interesting. You know, most people think this is made with sea water, but it's actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. That's not interesting.
You took my watch?
Well
Oh uh, I 'm sorry.
Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?
What?! Hello! We didn 't get married.
Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine.
Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...
Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.
A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.
Five.
Yeah.
Yeah, sure, right! Like I've ever been in Rachel Green's room.
My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-
Hi.
Don't you have to be at work?
Phoebe he 's right, that is the rule.
Actually it 's more like this.
Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're just havin' fun.
Y 'know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to
Yeah!!
Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It 's right next to it!
Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
Yay!!
Hey.
No.
No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I 'm interested in them.
That 's all you're basing this on?
Let's celebrate with some maple candy!
That would be nice.
I just wanna check something.
Never mind.
Oh my God!
And um...You look nice today.
OK, see ya later, nice meeting you.
Wow!
What's wrong with people having sex?
My God Monica!!
Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
What?
That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.
Yep.
Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I 'm a doctor, and I had a monkey. I'm Doctor Monkey!
Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of  "Underdog"?
Oh, I.. I don't know. We didn't really get to talk.
No.
Just then or-or all the time,  'cause we-we have jobs y'know.
He's a brilliant diagnostician!
Just please stop!
Then I'm happy too.
Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don 't know if we're really quite there yet.
We were on a break!
Well. Hey
How 'bout instead you, go get changed!  You, give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica!
Ok.
The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?
Oh,  hey, oh... I... I was-I was going for a hand shake.
Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.
???  Thro up a thro thro--a thro thro!
Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.
Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.
Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.
Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm too whiney?  So you're saying, I've become so whiney that I annoy you , Janice.
...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
I love you, love you.
You already know don 't you?
This screen is amazing, I mean Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.
Can we please focus here, a naked man 's life hangs in the balance!
We 'll be starting with apples.
That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on.
Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.
Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
No, I ah, I slept with someone else.
Huh.
Yeeeah!
You 're gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!
What-what is it?!
Yeah.
Duh, you think?
Mona umm Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no she's uh-well she's dead now. No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world.
What?
Hi! Sorry I 'm late. Were you sleeping?
Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2
Fighting?!
Yeah?
Yes, yes!
You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..
I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me
Oh, yeah, why not?
No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
Ok!  See? Scared of swings, I bet you feel pretty silly  Ow!
All right! You go get him! Let 's go!
Thank you.
Great!
Hi there!
Yeah, a real pleasure.
Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I 'll always remember that summer because that's when I realized that we are related.
I 'd like to spin the wheel!
I gotta get to work.
Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!
No! And I 'm not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.
What? No, no! Hey, hey, hey look...
But I didn 't want to.
Oh! That was Lambchop!
No! No! No! The  "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
Rach? You wanna come?
WHAT THAT'S A REAL NAME!
I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.
You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me  I have a date.  See?  ALL eyes on ME!
Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!!  Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God!
I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.
This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.
Did she  do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her!
Seven years. I mean we 've been together seven years, she's the only woman who's ever loved me, and the only woman I've-I've ever....
Ohhh! Kids!
So this is an annual thing?
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
You do, huh?
Sure, I-I-I...
That's okay.
Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!
Rach!
No problem.
Oh Mon, I laughed so hard
You still love me?
Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma.
I know, I know, it's, it's almost...
Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart
We 'd like to close our accounts.
You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.
Emily!
You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.
Nooo!
Yeah, I need uh I 'm just-I don't know-I don't understand, umm, how this happened? We-we used a condom.
Yeah.
No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
Good luck! Go get 'em!
So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!
It 's a good thing I didn't do it, because it sounds like it would've been a very expensive wedding.  Okay, good night
'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
So, what did you decide?
What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
Yes, yes it is. In prison!
Oh
Okay, it must just be me then.
Gotcha.
We 've got presents!
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part.  Helloo!
Okay, well, that Wow, okay, well, umm then maybe, at least we can, we can talk about us again.
So apparently I 'm available for lunch.
Hey, Joey.
Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah! Boys will be boys?
There you go.
Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
I think I might know what this is about.
Yes, but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products. This is amazing, thank you, thank you so much.  That's a pretty necklace.
Alright.
I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I 'm so sorry for your loss.
You do?
Aw, Mom...
Which one was that?
No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...
It 's no surprise that your winning, 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.
Pity food? Y'know what that 's okay, all right, I don't need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.
Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
Hop in.  Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
You did so. I swear, I swear - How long has she been in the bathroom?
I don 't know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there's this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.
Mhm,  packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.
What?
Obviously not to Joey.
I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.
Hi.
I can't catch a break!
I have an oily T-zone!
What?
It 's just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan 's, it's like-It breaks my heart a little. I mean I've always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y'know? Maybe fight over the science section.
You, you sure you need shoes?  Okay.
Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.
No, of course not!  ...Yeah, yeah, it is.
Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise?
Too far, Amy. Too far.
Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?
You did?
I love you.
Well maybe she wouldn 't have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!
Oh my God.
Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?
That is an old, Chinese woman!
He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
Forget it.
You think?
What are you guys doing later?
And smart!
Thank you.
Rain? Hi. Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat.
Oh, yeah, that 's the same, I am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings!
Hey!
No, but it 'd be nice if you realised, it's just a job!
And I'm Doctor Ross Geller.
Joey, uh- OM nipotent.
No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.
Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.
Hey!
No, I-I 'm not doody.
What was wrong with Mona?
I 'm-I'm sure that's not true.
You broke the pact!
Hey, tell Dan,  'Thanks.'
Can I see you for a second?
Well, you can help me!
Oh my God.
Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
That 's right! He was hitting on her, and I got her. I guess the better man won.  Please don 't take her from me.
Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you 're with me.
I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five.
Y 'know what I think it is? I think you've made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn't want to leave.
Hey.
You got it.
Phoebe.
What are you, what are you doing?
All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy.
Me too. Come here.
Susan Sarandon.
Yeah, yeah, I was watching.  Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what- what-what would you do next?
Oh my God! Whoah!
Come on Chappy, do your business. MAKE! MA-AKE! I did not sign on for this.
I know.
How 'bout Ben?
Hey!
No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.
Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.
Me too. I'm good at it.
Good! Me neither! So it 's not a problem. We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
Oh,  holy molly are we in a pickle now.
You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
Nope, just the one. RACH!
I 've never walked down the aisle knowing it can't end in divorce.
Oh!
I got bottled breast milk.
Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
Any time.
Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.
Oh.
Oh thanks!
Yeah!
Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
Hi. I-I hear you 're going on a ferry tonight.
Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.
No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...
No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can't -you can't do...
Oh, oh... maybe not you!
Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with.
Look, I don't care it starts at eight, we can't be late.
I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them all on my back.
Yep.
You have to respect the sea!
I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It 's not my fault.
Queen Victoria.
That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn 't it?
...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Ow, ow, OK. Alright, alright, Mon, Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, alright.
Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers.
you know I really admire your whole dating attitude, it's so healthy I'm always like is this moving to fast? Is this moving to slow? Where's this going?
Oh sure,  "Ross will do it!" It's not like he has a job, or a child, or a life of his own.
I love when you talk dirty to me.
Because he called here looking for you. So don't tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,
What?! I wh-, what 's wrong?
Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
No!
They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!
Buddy, my monkey?
I don't think so! You're just giving me Ruth so you'll get to name it when it's a boy, and that's when you'll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.
Yes! Yes! Yes!!
Pshhshhh!
Please, please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today.
I, er...
A Play-Dough Barber Shop?
Let 's give it a shot.
Thanks, man, big help.
Maybe it's a universal thing?
Yeah, it 'll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!
Oh hey, don 't thank me, thank yourself. You're the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
I was thinkin' about it.
Why?!
It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?
I know.
Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, I've got to go. I've got Lamaze class.
Right.
I 'm sorry, it's just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp-to be a counselor!
Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
Oh, I don 't know how that got in there.
Uh-huh.
You okay?
Well, okay so, I don 't have it all worked out quite yet. Just don't say anything to Rachel, please?
Oh, come on, now you know you want  'em.
See, I told you!
Yeah, it really was!
No! No! I want to talk now! Okay? I -In fact,  I am going to talk to the president of the condom company!
So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?
Give me two.
Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like 8-year-old boys.
10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
What 's wrong with this year?
Goodnight.
And you thought she was going to be in our way! So, why don't you, uh, open the champagne, and I'll be right back. I've got a surprise for you.
That 's 'cause-'cause you're mom's dog kept-kept looking at me.
Exactly!!
Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.
Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.
Shhh!
Look, we 're just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?
No Phoebe, don 't look! You don't want to see what's under there!!
Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
Dude!
Chandler!
Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
Bye.
Oh yeah, why not?
OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my questions have anything to do with Paleontology.
Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy.
Hey, I thought I cheered you up.
Hi!
Huh? Ooh  you mean like a Huh?
A lot of people are thankful for those.
Rachel, I 've seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?
No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um...
You sure?
Hey!
All right.
No problem.
Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?
Oh, okay, y 'know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...
Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
Well Mr. Big Shot is better than  'wethead'.
Nooo.
Wait! It was my plan.
I'm going to China.
Sure! Oh, and Joey 's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
Excuse me.
What? What?
No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.
What 's uh, what's going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?
I know!
Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he 'd be the stepfather of my child.
No, it 's not what I want either. I mean I-I can't force myself to fall in love with her again now.
So what 's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one.
But, what's great is that you don't mind talking about it.
This is the coolest house ever!!
Jill?
OK, well, um, have a nice evening.
Rach!
" subcategories. The first of these subcategories is "
Hey, whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me. Y'know, actually once-once I got dumped during sex.
Okay! Okay! Fine, I 'll stop! No teaching, okay? We'll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky.  Okay? Who's official name is Bapstein-King.
Why?
What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?
It 'll be okay Joe.
Why?
Why are you laughing?
Hey!
Ohh, okay.
The card! I think we 're there!
Hi.
It 's mine.
Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type "little", the idiot.
Yeah.
Yes I-I am. In fact umm hey, why don 't we try it my special way? You can dance on my feet.
Wow!
That was going to be my next argument.
Huh?
Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?
Happy Valentine's Day!  Or something to remember me by.
Yeah!
All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.
Bye.
Hey!
Bummer.
With an aptitude for science.
Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?
What?! How 's that?
Hi Julie.
The fear of Triscuts!
No.
Well, I came with Rachel, who should be back any second!  So what's new?
It was...This disagreement over... My god. You...you look beautiful.
Okay, fine!
Nooo!
No, because your not upset.
It 's a clown kit! Clown kit!
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
Mmm-Unmm.
Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.
Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
I 've gotta go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
That 's too bad.
Dude, you didn 't say Die Hard. Is everything okay?
Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y 'know? Say-say they're coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they're laughing, y'know, someone innocently touches someone else There's electricity, it's new. It's exciting. Are you telling me there isn't even the slightest possibility of something happening?
Hey, what 'd you guys do to get up on there?
What?
Look, I 'm sorry.
hey, fella! How you doing?
You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?
Ohh!
Don't say that.
Zoo dollars?
No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought -it wasn't that funny. So I'm still torn.
Just ignore them.
Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh...
What am I doing?
No, no, no, this weekend guys!
We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover.
Yeah!
And she just gave you this?
Hey!
Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be happy for each other.
About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.
Ben Franklin.
I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's first words .
That 's right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we're dating. And you may frown upon that, but we're not gonna hide it anymore.
Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?
Monica and I have a grandmother who died, you both went to her funeral, name that grandmother!
Oh my God..
Seriously?
You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you.
I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
Yeah, you too.
Really?!  Hey, y 'know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here's-here's 60 bucks, why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.
I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...
Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.
Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.
Peach pit.
Haven't had sex in four months, I should get a medal for that!
No.
Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone.
Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?
Yes?
....................Yeah.
That's fine, I'll just wait!
Uh-huh.
Yeah!!
Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
Open it, open in.
But you already told me everything.
No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!
I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!
Y 'know what? Actually I'm kinda glad they're leaving 'cause uh, I need to talk to you about something.
Ah, which, which one?
Yeah.
Hello.
Well, I 'd love to! Here, you wait right here and I'll go get the projector and my notes!
Why did you hate me?
Thank you!
Yeah, it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marc's Comics you know, I-I-I was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week-
Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you 're right. Yeah I guess I'll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
15?  Your personal best!
It was no big deal. We-we said that the rumor was that umm you had both male and female reproductive parts.
I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.
Joey! The vet said it 's a simple procedure.
You 're not a lefty?
Huh.
Rachel!!  Wow! You, uh, you look, wow!
I didn't say we were brothers.
You'd wait?
Phoebe!
Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
Oh! Man I don 't think I've seen you since uh, Lance Davis' graduation party.
Get Out!
Yeah. Why?
No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.
Wow, Monica 's letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?
Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth  Hornswoggle.
Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.
What?
I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man.   Whoa-oh-whoa! Are you, are you okay?
Shake it!
Right!
I 'm-I'm Ross by the way.
Oh, great!
No, you don't.
Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he?
Uhm, right!
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
To be fair, he doesn 't seem to be impersonating Fonzie
I 'm kinda beat.
Okay! Okay! Okay. I 'm sorry. Please, please, you were in Western Europe and?
I didn 't give her that ring!
What... what you working on?
Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg.
Huh?
Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think you're right. I think listen, listen!
No-no, he's, he's very docile.
This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.
It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
Tell me about it.
NO! No, no!
Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets.
What?! You 're in love with her.
Oh my God.
Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.
What?! What?! Rach what?!
Well
I don't think so.
JFK.
No, God! Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.
Hey, Phoebe.
Uh actually, we-we 've narrowed it down to two names.
Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.
I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.
Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I 'd have to talk you into this more.
Really?!
Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not that I'm keeping score or anything... five!
Yeah, I guess I should.  Man, y 'know what I have to realize? Maybe I'm just not the type of guy women can have just one night with. Y'know, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that.
Hi.
Hey Amy.
Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.
Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?
No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.
It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?
I am now.
I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.
Oh, I 'll-I'll come hug you.
My fault?! You threatened the judge!
I don't know.
Tell my son that I love him.  Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!
No.
Oh my God. Oh my God! And you 're-you're you're not freaking out?
I'm calling Mom.
Hey!
Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctor 's keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry
No.
Yeah.
Hey!
I 'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay.  Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical.
Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'
Yeah, I think she looks good.
I-I had to show Chandler something?
I 'm sorry, I don't believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.
Um, just some presents.
That 's less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was.
Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
Hey-yeah.  Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please?  Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!
Sure what kind?
Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were.
I'll get it
No, I arranged that...
Ah no. I don 't, but it could not have been more than sixty.
Your make-up!
I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office. There was some guy that freaked everybody out.
Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?
There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don 't you just hand over the keys?
Buddy, my monkey, my monkey.
Hey!
What? You do? You do?  Oh my God!
Oh. Yeah.  Uh Chandler let me win. No, Chandler 's really strong. Oh my arm is so sore. Oh nurse!
THE HELL I DO!
Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?
No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
What is this?!
There you go. Thank you!
It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize,  whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into the field.
So we should probably get going soon.
Hey.
Hey, I can handle it! All right?
Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!
You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.
That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It 's not like I choose to do it! It's not like-It's not like I said, "Umm, what would make this ride more fun?! "
Hate him? I No, I don 't hate him.  It's just it's Rachel, y'know?
Okay, umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like this before. I mean, I mean I 've been in um, relationships in general, uh but I have never done it with a student-I mean I not-not it! I mean, I mean I don 't-We haven't done it. Uh, I mean, I mean, we 've-we've-we've done stuff.  Okay, okay, a joke, a joke-lighten the mood. Umm, two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish.
Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated.
I don 't know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.
Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here.  Okay, you're in bed...
Take thee, Rachel... Emily.  Emily.
'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!
yeah thats a great idea!
Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean, it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!
Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in his own office?
Thanks. And-and hey Joe?
Again, it's not that he
Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.

What am I looking at?
Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
Wow! Yeah!
No.
What?  A-ohh!  Ohh. Oh that 's right that's right. That's Richard's favorite place too.
Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card?
Okay, that 's a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
We're all alone in an empty apartment.
You okay?
Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?
...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?
Great. So let's get going?
Um, no, I uh, I have done it before.
Pheebs
oh no yeah, no Phoebe is great, but umm I'm an idiot look right before you guys went out I accidentally got her all upset.
Please, he refers to me as  'wethead'.
Oh! Well then this is awkward. So what do you uh
Oh, see from where I was sitting I uh. . .
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.
I didn 't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn't finish the whole letter!
Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie.
And you had no idea they weren't getting along?
Awesome!
Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?
What do you mean?
What is that?
Oh y 'know, I still-I can't believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean it's It's like you and me going out, only weirder!
Right.
Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father.
Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!
Great. He 's doing great. Don't you worry about Chandler.
All right, we have a tie. Luckily, I have prepared for such an event.  The Lightning Round!
Are you serious?!

Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end?
Oh that is so great! That's
That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.
Rachel, I know that you can. And you should.
Wait a minute, look.
Look, look, there 's got to be a way we can work past this. Okay,  I can't imagine, I can't imagine my life without you.  Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach,  and, and....
Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger. I can't tell you how much respect I have for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition.
And I can even understand that you couldn 't tell Rachel, but why couldn't you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didn't.
What?
Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
Hi!
Eh, either way I 'll pass.  I still can't eat those.  What's so funny?!
Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus.
No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to
Argh!
Oh man, this is hilarious.
I am gonna see her again.
Damn it. It's never off the table.
Oh-ho, okay.
Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn 't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'
You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
Petty...
Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians...   "Can we walk"?  Oh, you... you like that?
Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally, technically I didn 't break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
No more falafel for you!
Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why don 't we get some shoes on ya, huh? Hey, why don't you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! Yay!!
So-so come! Why don 't you come?

Hey, I 'm not going to rush into anything!
Guess where they are?
This is weird for me!
Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
I 'm an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I'd be out and she'd, she'd see some beautiful woman, and, and she'd be Ross y'know look at her, and I'd think, God, my wife is cool!
Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.
Do you have a point?
Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley.
So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?
I know.
Nobody likes change.
Huh?
Oh, I will.
Bumming hard, guys, bumming hard.
Wait a minute, I-I believe I 'm entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?
Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
Yeah?
Well let's just say  Rosss caaaaan!
Wow! Happy Monica 's night!
Hey, do uh, do you have a minute?
Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high road, because in about five minutes I 'm gonna be saying
No, no he 's not.
No-no. It 's-it's me, Ross!
What?
Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.
I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
Okay, I know what I have to do. I 've got to go Red Ross.  Y'know, Red Ross!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school
Where in Cuba?
Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y 'know, then The Plaza for dinner.
Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don 't know, I feel like lately, I feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it's dumb, but I hate that I'm not a part of it.
Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!
Hey!
Neither will I.
Lemme see.
And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.
So, for the whole weekend?
Oh, just hold on a second. I 'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don 't know what the big deal is. I'm man enough to play this sport.
My God. Rachel!  Your here. I can't believe it.  What happen? Why are you here?
Barbados.
Nono, she's gone.
What?
Phoebe, you can 't massage people in my apartment!
Hey!
Hi!
I wanna say it's not looking good.
I 've said it! Okay?! But it's over Joey!
Your joke? Well, I think  'the Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth.  So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
Hi!
Thing, yes. Thing.
Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I 'm not a mind reader! Besides, I hate those conversations. I'm horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a gesture. Y'know, something that says we're moving forward without having to talk about it.
Yeah, yeah, oh!
Uh, nothing, I'm sure they'll be impressed with your excellent compuper skills.
Yeah.
This is Vicrum.
Uh, no. No, we're not.
All right.
No! For all I know, she 's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place.  Right here.
Alright, alright, ok. Bye.
Hi.
Joey, it's worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.
Hey, Pheebs.
No thanks. I 'm 29.
Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?
Really? You're not gonna return it?
Yes! We 're getting married?!
Okay.
Oh, you know what? You're gonna get it. I-I-I-I can feel it.
"There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct "
Take thee, Rachel... Emily.  Emily.
He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
I 'm sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y'know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a little.
Hey you guys!
Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?
Bye!
Even if we want it really bad.
Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.
Wow! How'd you get in there?
High collar and baggy pants say I 'm a pro.
Come on, you know they love you.
I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.
Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.
No!
That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want.  Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee! Now!
No-no. We
Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister , I love Pheebs...
Aww, is it broken?
That 's Daddy?! But doesn't it bother you? You're a waitress.
Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but... Susan
Monica bang! Monica bang!  Ow!
I 'm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.
Where there is no fear of commitment.
This feels perfectly normal. Ok, get on the swing!
What?!
I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?
Why? What?
Not even once.
Thanx.
Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunky s.
Okay, Pheebs
My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this.
I'm feeling better.
That was 14 hours ago.
Monica, I 'm cutting you off.
Okay, I'm working on my flirting.
Glad I could help man.
OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.
Eh?
Hey!
Seriously?
Look, I 'm not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
Well, anyway, it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him, because  I was about to do some serious damage!
Because it 's weird!
Yeah!
Wha-, you have a phone in here?
People can hear you.
Was your basket on top?
Really?
Chloe, Chloe how 's it coming?!!
The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
Could you be less enthused?
Hey.
What was with the dishes?
Oh yeah!
Great, how did it go?
Yes. I'm I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
And she feels the same way?
Yeah.
Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.
Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It 's one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend.  Oop, oh yeah!
There it is.
I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
Yeah!
That is Mark?
Oh God, here we go!
Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?
What 's up?
That 's okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn't want it to end this way, y'know?
I 'm telling you, I like the food!
Ohhh.
Uh, uh, well you're, umm, you're my lobster.
No. No, I didn 't. I didn't want to be that guy.
So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?
No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.
Monica told me you had a blind date.
Look, you wanna get off my back?
Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!
I mean we don 't want to go down that road do we?
People need juice!
Then you should have said something before I met her.
Nothing.
You'll see. Okay.  Oh, what's-what's her name?
I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?
I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
Sorry.
Dude!
Uh, you're not gonna win.
Okay.
Yes, yes I am, one of the many things I 'm feeling. Well....
This is Rachel.
Do you know the word crapweasel?
Oh you do, do you?
Thanks.
Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?
Uh, oh-ho bye.
Yeah I 'll press 1!
Okay dad.
What?!
I heard it. I heard it.
Yeah?
It 's like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we 'd still hang out?
Come on, tell me.
Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?
Yeah.
What, now?
Woooo! Yeah!
"...and I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll"!
Okay! Okay! But if she doesn 't call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y'know just to she what's going on, and, and she says she'll call me back, but then she doesn't. Then it 's over.
Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me "Sex for Dummies" as a joke.
yes, yeah I said something stupid about her never having had a serious relationship, but you should know she is so much fun, a wonderful person please don't blow her off.
Later!
Oh no. Dad! Dad! What  Oh God everything's ruined! Dad, she's gonna be crushed!
Now you are going to love these.
No! No, come on let her sleep! She 's so exhausted.
Ahh, I-I did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to.
We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.
Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.
No, I just think Monica was that fat.
What?!
Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me...
I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?
Okay.
Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.
It 's from France In Europe Western Europe. Y'know umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe.
Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.
It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!
Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff?  Well-
Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I 'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.
What? Why? What 's wrong?
I think she's lonely.
A wandering?
Hey guys!
What?
Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and he grabs the table and he pulls himself up. He pulled himself up. Standing man. I'm sorry you guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it.
Oh come on! That 's-that's true.
Okay, you are totally making this up.
Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.
What's going on?
No-no.
Wh -Hey-Whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!
A date.
Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?
Thanks for being born.
I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.
I uh I don 't know. I mean I I honestly didn't watch it.
Hi!
It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird.
Ohh! A man with a plan!
You wanna explain that?
Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage. It was nice, nice... uh... meeting you.
Cat.
All right, bad ankle, got it!
Correct. Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl 's breast?
Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?
... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...
It really was.
Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
All right, y 'know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I'm sorry, I'm just gonna have to take it back.
You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.
No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.
Maybe. But it wouldn't hurt to have a backup, you know? Uh, Rach-Rach, what were you thinking?
No, come on don 't start.  Ouch!
Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
Okay, okay, okay.
Well, I 'm gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like?
Breathe.
Hey!
Okay.
Oh, wow! Yay! Wow! Hooray! Oh, man!
Thanks!
I I do, I do not love Rachel. I 'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
All right.
Okay, I'll have the fixed salad and the duck.
Oh, you know, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna hang out, work on my music.
Hey uh, this is Elizabeth.
You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings
Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love.
No-no-no! It 's mine! It's-it's mine.
Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.
How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
That 's right! Wait no, Ben.
No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
The carbon, it 's messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.
Rachel said she 'd marry you?!
Oh no, yeah no, that part 's great!
Show them to me!
Hey!
You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.
It was you, pal.
So it 's looks like we're the first ones here.
Come here.
Do not rush me!!
Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?
Go!
Well uh, you see that, that little cluster of stars next to the big one? That is Ursa Major.
I know.
Y 'know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.
I don't know. But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know. He plays piano; I played keyboards in college. He's been divorced; I have some experience in that area.
Oh yeah.
You really didn 't know?
'Kay!
I just asked that girl out.
No!!
Hi!
Right?
Umm, no.
It's all working out! Me & Charlie, and you two. You know what we should do?
I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
Then what did happen?
Yeah, what's going on?

So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
What happened you guys?
Hi! It 's me.
Well, if you think it would help.
Is everything ok?
Hey hey, can I help?
Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.
Where is she?
No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him.
Yeah.
Congratulations!
Ohh, big smoker.
Oh no, maybe it's me , I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good...  IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris.
Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm standin here, huh.
No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman 's tux!
Hey, I helped you find Waldo!
Oh my god. Phoebe, you used to mug people?
Hey.
That 's not true! Her, she doesn't even know what she wants! Rachel's still mad about the whole thing.
'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man.
Oh!
Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.
Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.
Dude, what'd you have?
No, we 're not.
Where the hell have you been?
Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy!  Huh, am I having a boy?
You like it right?
Yeah!
It so does not!!!
Okay!!
I see... Thanks very much.  Is this your son?
Hey!
All I 'm saying is, it's one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don't know, like a  surprise!!
It's the -Chandler!!
Yeah!
How 'd did it go?
That would be no.
Breathe.
And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn 't moving.
Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?
Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.
Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.
What?
Look, we 've been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby.  It's just if-if we got together again and it didn't work out I could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking everything- Oh that's now me. What do they put something in the water in this place? Since Rachel and I we're doing really, we're doing really well right now.
Oh God.
That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
Y 'know this is actually not a great time for me.
Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
Okay. Um, how about these?
Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot!  Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!
Yeah.
I mean my God...
Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So  Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.
'Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.
What?
You 've sentenced him?!
Really? Wh-what's wrong?
I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this together!
Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.
Damn, this coffee 's cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins?
Fifteen.
But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!
Get the what?
Yeah!!
Oh, yeah, no problems. It 's all taken care of.
Crazy!
Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.
Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?
Ohhhh
Look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is gonna be there, everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.
I can show you, I have it on videotape!  It 's an expression.
Okay, it 's not, it's not.
It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.
Well, who's gonna kiss my sister.
Now I 'm so happy.
Really.
That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.
Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh  ...do you have any , um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?
What, Rach?
Alright, let's go!
It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says...  "What are you doing with those things? What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like a... like a real boy?
Dude, I was gonna ask her out.
Yeah, well, m-maybe you 're right.
It 's not for me, it's for Rachel.
ÃÃ¡Hola, Joey!
This is unbelievable.
Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?
Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?
Ah, what good are you.
Yeah, he-he 's right, he's right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you're young, you're-you're weird, chicks dig that.
So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there 's nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!
Me too!
Who did?!
A bit of a daredevil are we?
We love marriage!
No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I -I need to, I need to lie down.
What 's the matter? You okay?
Susan...
Oh, you know . . . we just drank some beer and Mike played with the boundaries of normal social conduct.
Easy.
For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh
This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.
Yeah? How'd it go?
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
No, it wasn't. You don't think I would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old
No, I-I-I 'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up!
They put that in.
Ah .
I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?
Joey! No!
Ah, the lesser-known  "I don't have a dream" speech.
Oh yeah? Yeah? I wonder why? What could that smarmy letch possibly want?
Hey!
Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
W-oa Mommy!
Ah?  Well, he and I would probably have a lot to talk about.
Hey.
Mon?
Good night.
Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.
Yeah, that'd be cool!
Rach, I'm so sorry.
We're still going at the game, right?
Diverse.
You sure you're alright?
You are totally jealous.
So how long are you in town?
Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.
Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.
You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like!
Y 'know what? I-I gotta go.
ÃÃ¡Ewww!
What, to blind my child?
It 's my joke.
Yeah.
Pregnant?!
Yes, very nice Rachel.
Yep, we got it, we got it.  Thank you so much.
Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye!
Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!
What?
I know that!
I don 't know.
Hi.
Goodnight.
Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go.
Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20 th?
No, no, no, no! Don't tell me! I don't want to know!
She was...
What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler!
Oh no!
No.
What? A brain transplant?!
What 's her last name?
Don 't thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization.  Here's Warren's number.
Yeah.
Well I didn 't! I didn't propose!  Unless uh  Did I? I haven't slept in forty hours and it does sound like something I would do.
Well did you try calling her?
I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.
I know! I know. You know what? I'm putting Ruth back on the table!
Uh yeah sure.
OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.
You all right?
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
Yeah.
I know.
Which one is Gina?
What? What? What?! You guys knew?  You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!
Rachel?!
Okay, okay, I'll go first.
Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.
When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a guy you know, for what? A week?
Five.
Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn 't work.
You don 't have to shout everything.
No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes.
Hello!
Come on! All the cool kids are eating  'em!
Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn 't expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now, but she's really terrific.
That is correct.
I 'm so we weren't in the car! Did he ever let up?
Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?
Okay, I
Okay, here I go.
I 'm sorry.
Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.
I don 't think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
You take care Jill.
Uh, Rachel, I 've been thinking. I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I'm calling it off.
That was good.
Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. I 'm just gonna put this  back in my pocket, pretend that didn 't happen. Uh yeah, actually I'm free now. Do you wanna grab some coffee or
All right. Y'know what? We don 't have to go downstairs! We can bring Vegas up to us!  All right, come on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go.  13.
I was not!
Oh no-no, after you.   Oh my God!
Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen.
So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe 's mom remind anyone of a cat?
No, you stop!
You know, I think that's a good idea-our babysitter just pounded in another Chardonnet.  Bye, y'guys.
And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?
Well, what was it?
How much did you pay for that?
Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
Let 's also get a hot plate!
Yeah, listen...
Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?
No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella.
Dad!!
Yes!
You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
Oh, well of course, the humiliating. So, so wee, we're okay.
What?
Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.
Now she's passed.
Okay! Okay! That's it!! Parents!! Parents!! Back away!! All right, this is our wedding day!
Yeah.
She's not a Tribbiani?
Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven 't played in so long, and-and, well it's-it's really personal stuff, y'know?
Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
Then don't do that, alright?
No.  So, um, let's see your pretty close, huh. Make-up's on, hair's done.
Hey, you 're right.
The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!
It 's worth the pain.  Y'know what, you know what? It's not.
Yeah, well.
Uh.
Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel , yeah! About jellyfish and how if you...  Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
I'm gonna tell Mom.
Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?
Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!
Are you serious?!
Yeah but uh Okay, okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slept together, but there 's something else.  Rachel's pregnant.
Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!
I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?
Hey!
Uh Rach?
Okay.  You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
Hey!
Yeah!
How do you count to five?
I know. That's why I did it.  Come on, are they really that bad?
Wha... what, here?
What the hell was that?!
Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
Aww.
No. You're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now, OK, you're not... rommmates anymore.
Hey, how are you holding up?
Honey, I love you too.
Oh no! An asteroid!
Everything okay in there?
Bye!
Pass it! Pass it!
Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.
Damnit!
Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It 's not just about the pictures.
Too little, too late, Benji!
Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk
Hey!
Will, high school was-was a long time ago.
Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on.
What? I... I...
I grew up with Monica! If you didn 't eat fast you didn't eat!!
Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh?  But.. we don't have to go down that road.
Eh,  'cause I knew that if I told you, you'd make me go, and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox.
What 's ah, what's so funny about that?
Of course, what happened?
Can't we just use a pen?
Oh my God!
What happened?
Rachel! Rachel!
Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.
Done!
Before the snap!
Oh God you 're right.
Amazing!
Yeah. Right.
But that 's not enough. So So here's a key to my apartment.
Hi!
Of course.
Oh cool!
Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
Hmm?
What?
No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You know
I know! I 'm saying you have to watch them all the time.
No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?
Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you!  All right Rach, let's go!
Dude! You're not taking your Bible?
Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
Damnit!
What?
Ah!  Oh.
Come on sweetie! You 've had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?
Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
Not on you! On the stripper!
Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
Are you sure?  Hold on.  I 'm sorry you guys, that was a coffee and a....
Well you said you couldn 't go out so....
If she is where you are then uh then my feeling weird about it shouldn't stand in the way.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?
I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
Chandler. When did he... when did he... when did he?
Now umm, remember I 'm still learning.
Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em.
Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.
That 's not really porn.
Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.
Nice shades.
That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler.
Okay, what 's up?
No, but come on, we 're off to a great start aren't we? I knew I'd get you here fast, but this has got to be some kind of a record!
Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I 'm gonna show her how tough I really am!
Hi!
Oh, oh Chandler...
Stop it.
And his first name.
Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!
Oh, thank God!
Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.
So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since I've been away at college.
Ah, I 'm sorry.
That little naked guy would be me.
Yeah, of course, Donald.
Well you 're gonna be a wonderful grandma.
All right. I think it was a mouse.
Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
Mm-hmm. She's-she's emotional, but, but ballsy.
I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
Hey!
Oh hey, that was a good one, huh?  Help! Help!
That is what the thing is.
Yeah, okay. Alright.
Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?
I, I just never think of money as an issue.
See ya!
I don't understand what just happened here.
Okay. Sometimes I feel
No you don 't.
Wow!
Nope.
That 's right!
Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--
You okay?
I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?
How might you be wrong?
Hey!
No.
Yes. Yes! Please, come in.
Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she like freaks out. Watch! Watch!
You need to get some sleep.
What are you guys doing?
Why, does it look like I 'm having trouble with my misshapen claw?
Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So
AND ON MY TURF?
Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.
Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?
But-but, Liam 's on my team.
Hey! How long until Pete 's fight?
No!
Okay, why are you here?
What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.
No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example
Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it.  Or you just do it.
Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
Ah, Cheryl!
Yes! yes!
Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.
Uh-hmm.
No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.
What?
Hey!
What?
Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
Hi!
Y 'know, I-I-you've done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?
Hey!
Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer 's office all I could hear was, "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Look, I just don't want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.
Me either...
...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration?  I could call immigration!
Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.
What are you doing?
Come on, I'm your older brother, ask me!
Oh, you've tasted it.
Well that brings me in the loop a little.
Ok... now... now we're just holding hands!
I 'm sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
Argue with that.
Sweetie, calm down, it 's gonna be okay.
Then don 't. Stay here. Just don't go so soon to London, just one more day.
Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign.
...and I really think it should be me.
Okay!
Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
Wait! Whoa-whoa, you you gave her the ring?
OK.
Oh, no, no, no, it 's-it's not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....
Things you find in the ocean,  You're gonna be on "Pyramid"!!
No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!
Oh well, I guess I 'll catch up with her later.
Congratulations.
I know.
Oh!!
Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't time!
Umm, it 's Cutie McPretty.
So uh, he seems like a nice guy.
Right, will you excuse us for one moment?   What are you doing?
No! No! I didn't do that. It's just Okay, honestly no. I don't, I don't see a big future with her.
Hey guys! Hey!
That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
Hey Mon.
What?! Chandler she 's our cousin!
Well, why don 't you correct him?
Yeah!
Apparently Phoebe 's mother also goes by the name Julio.
Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
Hi, is Rachel there?
Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here!
No, no I don 't want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that I'm not mad at you and and that I certainly do not hate you. I just, I just came here to say that.
Okay, the thing is..
Well, why're you all dressed up?
Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin......does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
Uh-ah!
Thank you! That 's what I keep saying.
No, you don't.
I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of us. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must know, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace
Or Joseph.
Hi, I 'm selling Brown Bird cookies.
Whoa! Ohh!!
All right, see you later.
How about the place settings?
No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
"Hi Rach, are you there? It's me, pick up. Rachel. Rach!"
I did, too.
Total wuss!
I had a 'K'. Where's where's my 'K'?
No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please -
Try sixty-five million years ago, and then try sssshhhhhh.... My tenure review board met today and I hear it's looking really good.
How'd the callback go?
The big book of childrens' names.
I 'm just trying to help you, move on.
What's going on?
When?
Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?
Hey.
Hello! Can I get you anything?
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..
Alright.
No, no-no, Ross Geller.
Huuh.
Yep.
With the circus? He's behind the elephant.
I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment.  What? What, now?
Guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant! I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you.
Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?
We 're sorry.
Yes you can!
Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
Three, Two, One!
C'mere, Marcel.
Yeah alright.
Oh, hi.
Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?
That 's okay. She's still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it's too late to do any of the things I had planned, so
Yay.
Yeah?
OH MY GOD!!
No! Why?
Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.
It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting?
Thanks.
What?
You had a rough day, uh?
Very bad.
Oh, I can't. I've got a date with that waitress, Katy, yeah, I know we've been only going out like twice, but I have a really good feeling about her.
Besides, there 's a big age difference.
My coat...
Oh. And what do you call that?
Okay, bye.
No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!
Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
Hmm?
Hi, Mrs. Green.
Okay!  Umm, I uh, I 'm your teacher. I'm sorry, you're-you're a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs.
What?
So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh is he a good guy?
No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...
Yeah! Oh my God!
What 's a scrud?
How are you?
Congratulations! Ohh, that's great!
No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.
It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!
Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so
NO! I don't!!
Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?
All right.  I'll uh, I'll see you later, okay?
What?
And she's a little mannish...
You're good.
Is everything allright?
Okay. Okay.  Umm hi, this is Rachel Green. I 'm Ross Geller. We-we called from the car.
I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!
Juice, I need...
Umm Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut!
Well why not?! She 'll-she'll love it! It's the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.
Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!
Yeah. Yeah. A little.
And that wasn't fun for you?
No, you 've heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I'm not going to tell you what song I'm gonna play either. But uh, let's just say when it's over I'll bet there will be a we bit o' celebration.
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
Alright.  The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming.  Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...
That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing.
I can't believe you hated me.
Oh. Hel-lo!
Yeah, right.
Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!
Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets it 'll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I? Rockefeller?
Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.
Why would I tell him?
I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
I 'll try that.
I can 't believe you told her I was going to propose!
What did you get?
He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.
Uh.... bean! Bean!
You 're fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
Why not?
No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir.
Hey!
What?
Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said,  'nobody won that game, ' and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and....  threw it in the lake.
Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I 'd expect nothing less.
Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.
The guy you gave your number to.
Noo. Why?
You 're back.
Hey.
Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.
Can't hold her own head up, but yeah jumped.
And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.
Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
Shh!  Of course, why don 't we go inside?
I don't even know what that's for.
I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.
That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me?  I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
Wait -oh-hey-huh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
Really?
Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal.
Oh she 's she's perfect.
Yes, tell me.
Thank you.  So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?
Rachel won 't talk to me! She won't even open the door!
Yeah.
The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
She does want to.
My mommies love me. That's clever.
I mean -no, it's just 'cause, it's just 'cause you and I were like a nightmare.  No, but there was some good times.
Try to understand!
Hey
Y 'know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don't we not speak until then.
11, unbelievable 11 is correct.  All right, that 's 4 for the guys. Ladies, you're up.
Oh Pheebs, that 's great. It doesn't count.
It's in Barbados.
Hey!
Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice.
Can you say Da-Da? See, I 'm gonna tell your mommies you said it anyway, so you might as well try
Alright, you know what? You're right. I should at least tell her how I feel.
I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.
That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!
Okay, you don 't have to stop, I'm invisible, I'm not here.
Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!
Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when - Oh bloody hell.
Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!
Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
Maybe that will liven up this party.
What?!!
What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?
So uh, Emily just went to the airport.
You and your ice.
Are you serious?
So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?
Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was
Oh my God!
Good call!
God! I can't believe she saved me for last.  Why are they taking so long?
Yeah... Yeah, that's true.
Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.
Go ahead, go ahead with the bird. Ok, do you have anything for around 200?
How did you know about that?!
I gotta go find her.
The doctor says it 's completely normal with all the hormones. Plus, you-you're sleep deprived.
Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.
Good night.
Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.
Correct. In what part of her body did Monica get a pencil stuck at age 14?
Hey.
Yeah-ha!
Wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines.
Well, hello Rachel!
Spiderman?
No. No.
So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!
Awww!
Okay.
Yeah, but when the baby comes she 's gonna want to move.
Rach?
You sprayed my front twice!
We're fine, we're fine.
Hi. Mom. Dad.
Hey.
You mean that?
Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough.
The Divorcer, to the rescue!
Yes!
Don't blame the questions!
It gives it a nice antiquey look.
Help! Help!! Help! Help!!
Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y 'know what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath.  I'm Ross! I'm divorced, and I have a kid!
Yeah, huh.
It's, uh... it's endearing, really.
I would never do that!
What?! While she 's been going through this hell, you've been making money?! You're betting on your friend staying in this misery?!
You 're welcome.
Sorry.
You think?
No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's uhm... my issue.
Oke-dokey.
First of all it 's Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn't fly.
Oh well I may as well have!
Oh.  Wow!  Huh.  Boy!  Well, someone 's been doing their homework.
So that 's the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
Hey Pete.
Didn 't you spend last night at Joey's?
Rachel! What are you doing here?
Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the bo -it's-it's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary . Um... here's a picture of me...
Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain
I love you too! I 'm, I'm gonna call you right now from the phone booth!  You can't hear me.
What?
Oh.  Hey, who's Carl?
Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this?
Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.
Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.
OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.
Ok.
I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand.
Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to sleep...
Hi.
Oh, come on!
Okay.
I didn 't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn't finish the whole letter!
How was I supposed to know we 'd end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
Uh, yeah, I 'll take a coffee. Thanks, man.
Uh, clearly.
Whoa-whoa, aren 't you a little over dressed?
Oh.
Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.
Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
Eww! No!! Her ear! All right, Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
Hey.
Okay.
Hey!
Are you kidding? Look, we 're not gonna be together just because we're having a baby. Okay?
Y 'know of-officer I uh I had the weirdest dream last night
What, you, you really quit your job?
I was backpacking across Western Europe.
Hi everyone.
Four.
These-these are beads of joy.
Hey!
I do.
I knew that was him!
Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.
We're rehearsing a Greek play.
Hi.
We are a rare breed.
Why?!
No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine!
I can't believe this is happening.
At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.
So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?
No, Rachel doesn 't want me to....
Ok!... All right, thanks! Thank you so much, you guys!  Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!
C'mon! C'mon!
Why... I... I don't know.  Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?
I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it 's-it's so great. But at the same time I'm thinking, "Well, I'm gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."
It would really help when I'm kissing you if you didn't shout out my sister's name.
Oh my God it 's just like I dreamed it!
Oh, my maple candy!
Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!
Really.
Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
That 's all right, we-we don't need you. In fact, hey I'm over it already.
I just grabbed a spoon.
You had fantasies about Emily?
Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....?
Yep, can you believe it?
Why do you care so much?
It's not a word!
Are you serious?
Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.
Well if it doesn 't matter to her, it doesn't matter to me!  Still not yelling!
Yeah!
Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?
Oh, come on you guys; that 's funny! Y'know? Because he's need-he's got like a hearing aide y'know, 'cause-'cause y'know, 'cause he's all old, and
Rach? Hi!
Oh-oh, Rach! I was just messin ' around!  Like you did last night when I had to pee?
Everybody!
Evidently they do.
I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.
Yeah, no, you 're right, I know, you're right, I'm not, I'm not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys.
What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
Yeah? How much?
Hey!
It used to be. Now she doesn 't really have a face. Smokin' body though.
She is a kook.
Come on, let 's go!
Look I-I don 't know what's going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.
What did you get?
Well ah, actually...
I broke my thumb.
Naked friends.
The big apple!
Well, you-you 've always had glasses.
Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?
Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
A date?! She 's-she's got a date?! With who?
I don't know. We could look it up.
No, I can 't. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can't leave him. Isn't-you don't think there's any way?
Uh-oh...
Still-still, let me come... for me.
Ezel!  Hey Gunther! You 're an ezel!
I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash.  So-so what I am saying is - is is that  is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!
Wow!
Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn 't realise that had become anything, yet.
Umm, jealous!
Oh great! We 're going out again Saturday. But I just found she's also seeing some other guy.
Wow! You-you look great!
Hey, here's a theme
Mmmm.
Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.
Which... which... which... Which one is it?
That 's, that's pretty.  Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing there Gert?
Thanks.
Yeah, she 's fired.
Rach!
Not using it right, Joe.
Maybe I 'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street
I know. Hey remember remember the night they got engaged? How uh, you and I almost
Weh...sigh
Yeah!
Hmmm-mmmm.
...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!!
