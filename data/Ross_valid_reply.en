You 're right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.
Oh what are you kidding? She 's gorgeous, it's all Rachel.
I see. So what do you propose to do?
Okay!
Okay, well here we are. Now we 're in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail?  Look, I,  I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I'm sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can't.  I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.
Uh that 's an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.
I-I 'm sorry Rach, I didn't know. Are you gonna be okay?
So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!
Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
Yeah, exactly.
Man!
Please start drinking!
Sorry, I 'm kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.
Do you have a minute? I 'd like to talk to you about something I'm, I'm really uncomfortable talking about.
Stop it!
I I don 't know what you are talking about.
Well, with everything that's been going on lately, I haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didn't tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?
I know. I know.
Have a good time. Ok, Ben.
Neil Sedaka wears them.
A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a chance!
Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine?
Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself,  "Wow,  I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."
Oh. Oh, that 's right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn't.
Oh no!!
Okay, good-good for you.
Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.
I'm so sorry
Yeah, she 's got to go back to London. But you know what? I've been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that's it. Y'know.
I'll...
Well we we don't have a garage.
Good-good-good.
No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?
And if you wait right here, I 'll go get Ross.
There you go! Good for you! And you know what, I'm actually getting used to this little guy. I don't really even feel him in here anymore.
Who 's your roommate?
Fine by me; hope she wins.
Who the hell is Jordie?
Yeah.
Sorry.
Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
Y 'know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at
What's a matter with me? You've got a black light. It's 1999!
I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody.
Oh, what? What-what?
Bye sweetie.
59 seconds.  Quartz, ha.
What, uh... what juggling thing?
Huh?
but you, your so much better off you just go from guy to guy having fun and never worrying that it terns into anything serious.
No-no.
Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
Okay, first of all, I don 't play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!
What?
Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
What are you talking about?
Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.
Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.
No, no, that 's funny. But maybe it's time to move on, let it go, y'know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth's father, so ah, he's much older than she is. Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils, huh?
For real?
Rach?
Look. Look, I wasn 't going to say anything to you, but... All right, I don't think you should be seeing Tommy anymore.
Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.
I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.
Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right, JUMBO with a U, sir.  No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment.  All rightie, bye bye.
I'm sorry I didn't catch.
Hey! Hey! Come on! You can! I know you can do this! Let 's go!
Uhm, I hadn't no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris. Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared.
That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?
Shhhh!
I just -y'know-I-I just have one-Rachel?!
No, no, don 't. Why don't we?
Wh-what 's up?
I want to go to the bathroom.
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh?  Ok!

All right.
No thank you for Thank you.
Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology.
And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work.  Now come on!
Yeah? Oh-oh, she 'd be so excited!
Yes, but I don't wanna die in your cab!
Oh sweetie, when do you think you 're going to get off tonight?
My God.
Hey!
But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?!
Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn 't propose.
200 at least.
Okay. So well I 'll umm,  I'll have her home by midnight.
Yep! That's my thing...
Oh, oh, ok, great. You know what, while you're at it she said another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up
What? No! No, I 'm not stopping. I'm Red Ross!
But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don 't think there's really anything you can do about it.
Well, I thought it first, Holmes.
Dad, we-we can 't believe you're selling the house.
No-no, thank you Miranda.
A little bit.
Thank you Gunther. We didn't want to have to go and do that.
What are you talking about?
Oh, I was unbelievable.
Y 'know, he hums when he pees!
A green LeSabre?
This is not good for my rage.
Bye!
C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!
Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on!
Hmm-Hmm.
Yeah! yeah, I got tenure!
Hell yeah!
I don 't know, but-but look how shiny!
But I'm not! . You know what if you're in the mood for Thai food...
I!
They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it.
Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but I-I don 't think he-he knew what it was.
Hey, Mon.
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.
Yeah.
Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!
Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!
Marenge,
She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
But having a dove place the ring on your finger would 've been no problem?
Did I do something to you?
...desperate, needy, pathetic?
I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining. I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.
You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven 't actually met...
Yeah, no problem.
Hey.
Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.
Good luck.
Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.
Nono, that would be me again.
Is this about Mark?
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it 's, I mean it's you.
I'm gonna have to give him up.
Yes!
Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,   "If you accept full responsibility..."  Full responsibility! "...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do.  Does it?!!"
It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.
C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
Yeah!!
Okay.  You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
Huuh.
Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
Ooh. What is the name of Chandler 's father's Las Vegas all-male burlesque?
I... ahem... I really don't think so.
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she 'd say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!
Oh.
Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
Anyway, if she, if she wasn 't in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?
Uhhhhhh that-that may be weird.
Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!
Hmm-Hmm.
Of... of what?
Pheebs, what about you?
How weird is that? Y 'know? You're moving in with me and have the one thing I don 't have. It's like uh, in a way you-you complete me  kitchen.
What??
No.
You come out there, you're a dead man.
About what?
Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
They make you take an oath?
She was blonde?  Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years.
I got some, uh, hers and hers towels for Susan and Carol. And, uh, I got this blouse for mom.
Surely you can think of something good.
Hey.
Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?
Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!
Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.
Petty...
Y 'know what? I-I'm not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay --Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me feel Ned?! You used me! You don't love me and you never did!  Ah Professor Winston, Professor Fredrickson, I'll be right with you.  Don't make this worse and I'll give you a C.  Shall we?
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.

Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!
No, why?
Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.
Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.
Yeah.
Hi.
Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!
But, you, you don 't want to seem too pushy.
No!
Where 's Ben?
Yeah, that's it?
Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.
All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.
Oh, you have some studying to do?
of course she has. if she'd never had a serious relationship I'd go round broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron.
Wh- are you welling up?
Come on, Chandler.
No, Rach, no. I don 't, I don't, I don't have to think about it, in fact, I 've decided, I've decided that, that it.......does.
Let me hold him for a sec. There.  Huh? There we are.
Hmm-Hmm-Hmm.  Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let's talk more about you. Hmm.
Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?
I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
I know, and I can't stop sweating.
Well, the lighting was okay.
Well, I 'm going to take off.  Congratulations man.
Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I 'm sure you are with your wife!  Oh, I'm sorry!  It's unbelievable!
Yes, professor Feesen-sen- stenlger I 'll be with you in one moment.  So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints.
One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis... WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've not finished counting!!
No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island.
I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again.
Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
Because there are naked ladies there.
Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!
Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead.  Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?
You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!
...that center around work.
So, so now do I get Joey?
So really, what'd ya have?
Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller.
Really?
I 'm agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?
Fine. You 'll-you'll watch it on video when we get back.
See, there are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated.
Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is.
Uh-huh.
Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.
Okay.
Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe?
Hey!
So? Sure! But it-it wouldn 't be anything romantic. And I'm-I'm dating Mona-Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! What is wrong with me?!
I 'm sorry, I meant a blue LeSabre.
Because, because I 've got Ben.
I'm a four?
And what --What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don't get the annulment. Don't type that! What?! Stop typing!  Hey! Stop typing!  Stop typing! Stop typing!!
Yeah, yeah.
Why not?
Hey Joe, while you 're over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?
All right, I 'll see you tonight.
Yeah? Well, I-I think Ben 's asleep.
Amy. I'm going to save you some time, ok. <spins finger around in circle> All me.
No! The reason I 'm asking is that I sorta had one last night.
Mm-hmm..
Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he 's so cheap, he'd never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough?
Joey, give me the bag.
Aw, y 'know Y'know, maybe we're-we're just approaching this all wrong. If you're Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you'd go?
Yeah, maybe.
Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.
Coffee sounds great.  Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey, just remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?
Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First, I 'll divide my perspective canidates into catergories....
Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre please see the front desk? Your car is about to be towed.
Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--
Really? Its not just frowned upon?
I dunno, there's just something about...
Yeah, why?
We 're having a baby.
I do. I do. I do.
Yeah?
Well, I thought so too, but then she said she 'd marry you.
Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica.  Oh, I guess he doesn 't feel like talking right now. He's smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.
Really?
Ahh.
Buy mommy.
Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake.
Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie
Just the crab cakes.
What?
Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin ' babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!
Wow! We are pretty good at this!
You let Rachel come back, and it 's done.
Fine. I 'll go.
Yeah, she never misses these conferences!  No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!
Yeah, I recognize the ankles!
Shoot.
Well, Ben would be there.
Oh, wait! Wait! Don 't you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you'll get that job!
What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?
That's a good point.
And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi.
We think Chandler might be having an affair.
That's alright. Listen, listen.
Oh, ye-ah!
Really?
No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!
Right! Right! I just -I want you to know that I'm going to be there through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctor's appointments, the uh, the Lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment-Although we could probably worry about that 'til after we get married.
The routine!
Cookies and porn, you 're the best mom ever!!
Am I?!
Did you see me write one down?
I, Ross
Hey, guys!
Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's?
Yeah?
Yeah -No-but-but-but-but! We're just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that's not scary right?
I prefer not to answer that right now, I 'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
Well, we believe it originated here.  In the Aroma Room.
Yeah.
You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
No, no, I knew .
Nothing! What do you say to that?
Good. Maybe he can switch it back.
Baking it didn't help, huh?
Well, it matters to me.
Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that.
It 's heads.  Gentlemen, pick your category.
Food.
When, when were you... under me?
By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.
Oh, please. Sweetie it 's hopeless, okay, I'm just gonna go.
And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants
Okay, see ya later.
I know. I am, I am so sorry.
Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you not look there?
Yeah.
I 'm-I'm not kidding. Look I-I, I can't have three failed marriages. I can 't. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
One more time,  "Hey, don't you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"
Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I just  Why don't we just let the machine get that?
We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
No, but it is frowned upon.
Sexy?
We 're so lucky.
Yes but too me he's just, man.
Wooooo!!!!
What? Oh, okay. Wait here.
I suppose.
Wh-what did he say?!
And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler.
And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.
China.
Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see. .
I know, I know. I shouldn't have waited 'till now to say it, but I'm.. That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry, but I'm telling you now. I love you. Do not get on this plane.
There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.
Well, Mon, I was married.

Yeah.
Just go for it Chandler.
I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
Come on! That 's great.
Hey!
Chandler-
What? What?
Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.
All right so, Chandler, from now on, don 't give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don't turn your back to him.
I guess...It still seems a little... moonlight boat ride!!
Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn 't bring you here so you can ambush her.
Exactly. So you didn 't, didn't mention anything to Issac right?
Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.
No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in -No, yeah, okay.
Hey uh, well, today 's my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?
Hey, what are you doing?
Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic.
I said ' share ' not ' scare '. Go sit over there! .
No way.
No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done!  Ahh!
Rach...
But we do!  It's gonna be ok, Rach!
Really? Me too!
Stop saying,  "Blood" to strangers.
You-you-you-you  threw my sandwich away!
Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure.
I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist.  All right Joey, we get it.  I'm sorry.
Yes! Santa's coming!
Hey. Oh, I 'm sorry, this is Cailin.
I don 't think you do.
Department of Sanitation?

Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She 's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
No.
Why don 't we talk about this on the way to the hospital?
Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
Okay look, I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do this after
No!
Actually, it looks really good.
You didn 't do it?
Good.
Oh, what were the other two?
What, oh my God. What did you do?
Oh, thank you so much!
Dude, we were good!
Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.
Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well okay -I'm scared for my health!
I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the chances?
OK.  I'm in my apartment...
Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.
Why-why would I care about that?
Yeah.
Over my dead body!
Yes, we have something we have to get to.
Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie!
Oh man.
Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she 'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.
Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day? Well, alright, even though he's your super, I'm seizing.
Catch any big fish?
What?
May 12th?
I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
Yeah, okay, hold on!   They're not coming on man.
Ben!   I mean, Ben! Ben!
Oh. And how was the date?
It 's a great class.
When, when were you... under me? Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you, uh. . . What?
You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace.
Joey, I did not break this! Okay?  That has been broken for a while.
Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
What? What?!
Okay, I 'm done with my choices, these are final.
Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?
Emily? Emily? I 'm coming in.
....I have to go to China.
Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
Oh-ho please. Ask her how?
No.
I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'
Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.
I don't think that's what this is.
Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't give you up.
Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.
Yeah. What-what should I do?
I'd lead with that.
Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where my wife is.   "Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?" Don't know!
Ahh.  Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
I 'm just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?
Look, I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your silly
Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?
Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm...  When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll...
Hey guys!
Alright, I'm gonna go find them...  I just need a... need a before I can... you know.  Grandma... grandma... grandma...  Okay, I see you later.
What? You forgot fourteen states?
Ah, must 've been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.
Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right?
I love you!
Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I 'll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.
Lighter than air...  But that's not the point.
Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?!
Alright, okay.
He 's right, what she did was unforgivable.
I am dressed.
Thank you for a delightful stay.
I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.
Excuse me?
Joey, I figured you 'd understand. I mean, I-I've known him a lot longer.
Well...
Go!
Okay.  Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That 's been one heck of a see-saw hasn't it?
Good for you.
Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
All right. All right, I 'll do it.
Oh nice tan!
I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.
Hey! Hi!
No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?
Yay!
How is that important?
yes, yes I did. and I will also say what I'm about to say Vis-ÃÃ -vis the following Phoebe has never had a serious relationship since her. super- serious relationship with. Vicrum.
Please, you're going down!
Damnit!
Hey Rach...
Huh. Wow, this is great.
You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
I like your bow.
Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel "Mommy" when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...
Poor baby, you 're so tired. Rach, I didn't propose to you, Joey didn't propose to you, and Chandler didn't propose to you.
No!
I'm gonna use the cushion.
There y'go.
Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
Yeah! Oh yeah, you 'll be fine! It-it'll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y'know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won't.
Well, I don't know.
Hey! Hey, guess what Joey has!
Whoo!
Ah actually we don 't.

Okay, it 's not, it's not.
No! You let go!
Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you.
One more day, seriously/
I don 't think that we are.
Umm, no. No.
Yeah, maybe not. So what you wanna do?
Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!
That bitch!
Then tell him quickly.
Yes. I mean, it 's what we always planned.  And if you have a plan, you should stick to it.  That's why they call them plans.  Hello?  I'm fine.
That's great! So you're staying in New York!
No, but I want...I want the pinecones!
Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
What?!
No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.
Yeah. No. No you 're right.
You look great. I, uh... I hate that.
Not you.
Yeah I know.  On the other hand in um, in about seven months you 're gonna have something that you're gonna love more than any guy you've ever gone out with. Just wait. Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger. You have no idea.
Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.
Well, we didn 't have freedom here until 1776, either so
Hello!  Oh, sorry.
Yeah.
Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!
Okay.  So, um, Phoebe tells me you, ah, you play piano.
Ready to go?
Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.
What?
What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!
And that 's funny, why?
Seven.
Yeah?
Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?
Mmm.
KARL!
Rach. OK, forget, forget the lobsters OK. We're, let's talk, what about us?
Why?
It 's Ben and his Da-Da. Da-Da? Can you say Da-Da? Y'know, you might as well say it because I told your
Oh my God!
Oh, absolutely!
Great. I feel like an idiot.
Oh, it looks like mom and dad 's house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is Oh my God!!
Bye.
All right, we'll work it out.
Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?
What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!
Split it?
So we we both wanted to.
Rachel, lock the door. Lock the door, seriously.
Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?
The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
C'mon! Joey! What is it?
And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your-  -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
No, no. I-I'm good.
Mona? What are-hi! What are you doing here? I'm, um, supposed to pick you up!
So you two are..?
They have another guess.
Oh! What a game, huh?
Well it turns out that Ben and Sting 's son do not get along.
I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
He didn't get the goggles!
Yeah!
Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--
That tastes like feet!
Althea is correct.
I-I'm, I'm having a boy?
That 's a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes I will be there to to feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want to do all those things.
Sure. I 'll help you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?
Joey.
I didn 't get the annulment.
Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?
I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay.  There we go, there we go.
I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so...
Yeah, okay, Scott!
I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.
Umm, oh, hey, I don 't know. How about a big one?
Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.
What's up?
We were drunk! I would 've married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!
You 're drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
Okay, okay, see... that... that is the problem. He is too sensitive.
Chandler 's gone again!
So, you gettin ' tired?
'Cause Carol's a lesbian.  And, and I'm not one. And apparently it's not a mix and match situation.
No!!!
Nope.
Oh, mine too. Isn't that neat, scotch neat. Would you excuse me?
That was in high school! It 's not like it was binding forever.
Hi, um, I'm err,  I'm Ross Geller, and err ah...  ..that's, that's my boy in there, and uh,  this is Carol Willick, and this... is Susan Bunch. Susan is um Carol's, just, com...  ..who's next?
Oh man.
Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I 'm-I'm 12 years older than she is.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.
What?! It is?!
No!!
I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.
Oh well. It probably would 've been the most constructive solution.
Let me see that!  Oh man!
I 'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.
He 's right, even if it's to say something complementary.
You 're never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That's great news right-I mean for them. Right?
Thank you.  All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?
Oh-no-no-no-no .
Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.
Oh yeah!
Yeah, well...
Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.
OH MY GOD!! I didn 't really believe it until you just said it!!
Oh-oh, yeah.
Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented.
It 's funny you should mention diapers.
Cheers!
Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
What?
As a romancer of the elderly.
What?
C'mon, what's his name?
What happened?
Woooo hoooo!!!
Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!
No, no. She's way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy.
It didn 't.
Really? Which one?
Are you sure?
Yeah, have a seat.
Oh God!
Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush.
You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?
I 'm sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.

Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody 's stairs!
Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.
Y'know, it's interesting! Most people think that's made with seawater, when in fact-
I think that would be best.

That's so sweet.
Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
What'd you say?
Dude! That's my sister!
Er.... um.....
No! Hey! Hey! We can 't!
Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.
Rach?
Thanks.
Na-huh.
No!
Okay, I know I 'm not supposed to know, but I do. And I'm so excited for you!
You're welcome.
I know!

What you don 't think I'd go up to her?
Look I 'm sorry Pheebs, I can't do it.
Oh my god, this really hurts!!!
Oh yeah, she 's-she's amazing. And-and she's so much fun. And! Y'know what? When I'm with her, I'm fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes.  She's leaving in two days, I don't have to do it.
Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.
What?!
It 's a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'.
And! Break!!
I know.
Thanks Rach.
You like it?

No, Mike, no, no. You wanna pick me, I mean... watch!  Huh?
I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!
Are you kidding?
Hey!
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
Yep.
Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must 've seen me cruising in the bad boy.
No, I 'm good.
Ohhhhh!
Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine 's Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean.
Come here  Oh! There she is! Hi!
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
Okay sorry, whew.
You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.
Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now. Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time.
Okay, I 'll see you later pal.
Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head! You can do it! You can do it!  Okay. You got it?
Sorry.  'Cause umm, I think this will make you a little more sophisticated.
So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money.
Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.
Rach, I told you, you can't call him every time any little thing comes up.
You gotta hear this story.
We have got to start locking that door!
Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out.
Yeah, I'm sure.
I know. Can you believe that?
Mississippilesly?  Well, how bad is it?
Did that guy just call you Toby?
So when do you think you 're gonna talk to her?
No.
No look I wasn''t right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey.
Soon he 'll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.
What?! That-that 's all the way cross town, I'm supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.
Look, don 't worry about me. Okay? I'll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I'll uh, I'll be that guy right out of the circle.
Ohhhh
Huh?
Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest  But we had our best friend's interest at heart.
Wow! Umm, okay uh everyone this is Isabella.  What?
Oh my God. It's like Sophie's Choice.
Dude, you're not tanned.
Okay, I gotta go.
No no no, go-

Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the...
Yeah! Yeah!  Oh, this will make a great memory.
Why?
This is beautiful!
What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe -Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!
All right!!
They kept your room for a while.
No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It 's usually, "Surprise!" And then, "Oh my God, I'm so surprised-good-bye!"
What do you mean?
You go get  'em.  What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?
Oh! That is so thoughtful.  She's a keeper. And what did you bring me?
Although I was married to her.
Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card y 'know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
Hey!
What?! Why?!
To London! Come to London. Please? It 'll mean so much to me.
You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...
Anyway seriously, uh just just talk to the guy, okay? And tell me how it goes.
Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt...
Oh look, did, did you just see that? Did you see? He just waved, he just waved, he's never waved before, you've never waved before. Yes he has. Very good.
Give me the bag.
And uh, Rachel.
Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.
Oh yeah, let me just finish this.
Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
Hey, I've been married 3 times
Is that -are you saying yes? Is that yes?
No way!
Well In-in case of emergency.
Yes that 's right.
Hello, Susan.  Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?
Yes! You 're the person who checked out my book?!
Cannot feel my tounge.

Challenge excepted.
What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
I'm good.
Why does anyone have to be naked?
Yeah.
Monica did it?
Oh, I see, so everybody wins.
I can 't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
All right then.
Yeah.
Yeah!
What-what?
Hey!
Ok, Mom never hit.
No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Hey!
But, you are.
Well, I mean it 's not all bad. I'm learning to appreciate the uh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.
It 's ridiculous!
Hi, did you order some bananas?
..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-
Bunny!
Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben.

Sure, Monica would have to give her up.
Damn super cuts!
Oh, that 's not true! I've got her lots of stuff she never took back.
Try telling my wife that.
Sorry! Sorry! Oh,  there!  Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!

Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!
Here!
Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y'know I 'm sure that's not gonna happen this time, why don't I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph's.
Oh, don't worry about it! Just use your travel insurance.
I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the voice of Underdog!
Wha... what do you mean?
She's not even here yet.
All right.
No?
Who?
You got me a cola drink?
Y 'know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don't even care!
What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!
Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.
I know. (Rachel bends down to Emma and Ross looks over his shoulder again,
Fine, you 're right. Let's ah, let's take a break,  let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yoghurt, or something..
Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
Wow.
Hey, Fun Bobby!
Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby.
What? You have a date? Who with?
How does this look?
Hmm
No, no, really. You should go. Just go! Go! Go out! Really, the world is your oyster. Kick up the heels. Paint the town red.
Then be supportive like a guy.
Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!
I don 't care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she's totally freaked out!
Marlon?!
Yeah well, if ah, if that 's the rule this weekend...  No!
YAY!  quick thing, I went to talk to Mike.
Well, we should probably get going.
Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.
It 's my new apothecary table!
What?
You have no idea how much this hurts.  Keep going! Keep going!
All right. All right, I 'm gonna do it!
What?
It's alright, it's no big deal.
What?  What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.
Well..
Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!
Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no! No ad-libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings.

Oh! Hello uh, Mona from her restaurant.   Mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name.
Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?
You ducked!!
Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out.  Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
Well, it was loong. I didn 't even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o'clock shadow on her head.  Anyway, she didn't want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.
Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport.
That's what it seemed like.
Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay?  Rachel!
How could you tell her?!
Marcel! What've you done to him?
What are you saying?
You should go.
Sure.  Joey
Oh my God!
Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?
Oh, I am very in.
Hey.  Happy Thanksgiving!

Oh, I hate this story.
What are you kidding? It 's Batman's tux!!
Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?
Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.
Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
What?! Over a stupid room!
That's not a thing!
Oh-no. No. No.
Wait, wait,  You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.
In the closet.
No, you didn 't!
Well, I-I better get to class  Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way, Phoebe?
Whoa.
What?
Hey, I am not unemployed. I 'm on sabbatical!
Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friend shaking up. Oh, that's great. That's great.
Um uh We're-we're just having this baby together but uh, uh that's all.
Dad dad, please! As I was saying umm, I'm Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh, and I'm the best man. And uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is my little sister. And, she's the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if you'd all please join me in raising a glass to the, the couple we're here to celebrate.  To the Bings.
Ooh, that's great, I love those little guys.
Aw, how can you say that? I can't even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?
Freakish.
Ooh! There 's no way to do this without her? 'Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.
Wait a minute! How-how the hell did you beat us here?
I think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? She's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts. Can I get a blue bow?
Oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?
God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you to call me that.

Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'
Okay, we 'll be right in.  So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
Oh, it's my new beeper.
Hey, you guys!
He said he liked that!! Oh you 're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves!
I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...
I mean, you just went out with my best friend, and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea.  Or-or not!
Yeah, but don 't you think....
I get it! Well, that 's that.
Y'know if we ever go to war and you 're captured, you're in for a big surprise.
It's an empty apartment.
I know and yet here you are all ready for the next date.
Hey you guys.
You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head! What the hell were you thinking?!!
There 's other stuff too.
Yeah.
Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way  which uh, which was misleading. Well I 'm  Hello.
OH MY GOD!
Uh-huh, I see that.
Listen, I got to tell you I 've-I've never been to a guru before, so...
Okay, good bye!
That little naked guy would be me.
No no, you're uh, you're my lobster. See um, lobsters, uhh, in the tank when, when they're old, uhh, they get with, uhh, they walk around holding the claws. In the tank, ya know, with, with the holding and. . . Uhh, Phoebs you wanna help me out with the, the whole lobster thing?
Yes, and the dimmer switch.
Because it 's the highest.  Okay, Rachel you're up first.  Situation No. 1
Yeah! Right!
Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you.  I'm fine!
Oh-oh, you 're-you're fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for, hmm? Perhaps,  perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings on the Smiledon Californicus?
Hey, I'm more cop than you two!
Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn 't stop it. I guess I-I just wasn't thinking
Hey you guys, I need some fashion advice.
Hello.
So do I.  Okay Rach, before anything happens  I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules.  This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of  "Us."  Okay? I just want this to be  about what it is!
Okay, let's go.
Ohh.
Yeah!
ALL RIGHT!! Phoebe now come on! Will you please tell me what it is I did that mad you so mad at me!
Than I want mine, too ! And if I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.
It 's not a big deal? Oh, I'm sorry I just um, I what about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I like-you-you can't stop thinking about her. Like how you can't sleep?
This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.
No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.
Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?
Okay, I 'll be up in,  18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.
No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.
Yeah.
Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that.
Sure! Here.
RACHEL!
You grow up.
Oh, it's not the ideal way...
Okay is there some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?!
...Gets interrupted. Hi!
Oh come on! Here we go!  Stand by for mission countdown!
No!
Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...
No, you don't.
Mine stole my newspaper! It 's like a crime wave!!  Pheebs, you uh, you got a second.
Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.
OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!
Hey, y 'know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?
And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he- he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you 're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls.
You really think so?
I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?
That 's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
Uh...sure I do, and I also wanna be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.
Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
All right Pheebs, your cab 's ready.
Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys
Hello!
Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little  "playing" ourselves.
Hi.
will be two months
Ohh, Geller 's got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh!  It's the classic struggle between man and- Someone knocked over a lamp.
Bye Ben.
Look at Emma!

I can 't believe no one believes me!
Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.
Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y 'know?
All right, did you just say all right?
Joey, please.
They're towing your car, they're towing your car!!
Yeah -no, just that last song.
Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said,  "Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?"  Yeah, then you did that.
Here.   At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.
You're just saying that 'cause I said no to your name!
Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and you'll see!
Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?
Okay.
Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much!
Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight.
Yeah!
Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
Look, I-I 'm really sorry I let go of the bike.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily!  It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush- shhst!  Hi!
Wha... what you really think we can do that?
Ouchy.
Well, as much as I 'd like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren't going to be here. All right? I mean, she's going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I've got a whole special evening planned. So I'm sorry, no party.
Dude!
You know what? I don't need a tie. I mean, it's better, open collar. You know, it's more casual
What?
What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?
Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.
Well, apparently not, and I can 't just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!
Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.
That 's interesting, but check this out. I date her
No, not you.
No, I 've looked everywhere!
Hey.
WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
I wasn 't sleeping.
Oh, oh, we did say we 'd stop by this little thing Joey's roommate is having.
That 's right! That's right, don't you play a woman?
No.
Yeah?
Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say...
Can't do it, can you?
What are you doing here, Santa?
You're wrong.
Hey I 'm sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I've got this meeting at school. And- and he-he asked for his uh, 'Fun Aunt' Rachel, so
A-a-and... record.
Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap.
What is Monica 's biggest pet peeve?
Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I 'm having a great time! Y'know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it's not. I mean it's not at all.
How about all the way.
But, okay.
Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?
Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...
Wha-, oh, quit it.
Yeah sure.
Yeah.
