[Scene: Central Perk, Joey, Ross, Monica and Phoebe are there as Chandler
enters]

Chandler : ( _excited_ ) Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what  
  
Joey : Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?!  
  
Monica : ( _shocked_ ) Really? ( _She looks around, suddenly embarrassed_
) Let's get past the moment.  
  
Phoebe : What's your news?  
  
Chandler : Thank you. I got a job in advertising. ( _Everybody cheers_ )  
  
Monica : ( _hugging Chandler_ ) Oh, honey, that's incredible!  
  
Phoebe : ( _inquisitive_ ) Gosh, what's the pay like? ( _Everybody stares
at her indignantly_ ) Oh, come on people ( _defending_ ) come on, now, if I
don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most! ( _She looks
at Joey_ ) Hey Joey! ( _Joey winks at her_ )  
  
Chandler : Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship.  
  
Joey : Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'.  
  
Chandler : Right. So, it'll be the same except less sex with you. ( _Joey
nods_ )  
  
Ross : So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?  
  
Chandler : Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the
people they like.  
  
Phoebe : ( _enthusiastic_ ) That's great.  
  
Chandler : Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which
will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little
humiliating  
  
( _At the same time, Gunther puts down a cup of coffee in front of Chandler_ )  
  
Chandler : ( _grinning awkwardly_ ) Humiliating and noble!  
  
( _Gunther shoots a nasty look at him while leaving_ )  
  
Ross : You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have
been really good in advertising.  
  
Monica : Ross, you did not come up with "got milk?"  
  
Ross : Yes, I did , I did! ( _He turns to Joey, disappointed_ ) I
should have written it down!

Joey : ( _entering_ ) Hey!  
  
Monica : Hey!  
  
Joey : Where's Chandler? I wanna wish him good luck on his first day. (
_Monica smiles_ ) ... and I smelled bacon. ( _taking some_ )  
  
Monica : He just left.  
  
Joey : ( _puzzled_ ) Who did? ( _Monica looks bewildered_ )  
  
Rachel : ( _entering_ ) Joey! You never gonna believe it: she called.  
  
Joey : ( _standing up, surprised_ ) She did?  
  
Rachel : ( _enthusiastic_ ) You got it!  
  
Joey : ( _still surprised_ ) I did?  
  
Monica : What is she talking about?  
  
Joey : I don't know, but it sounds great.  
  
Rachel : Your agent called. You got that audition.  
  
Joey : With Lennart Haze?  
  
Rachel : Yes.  
  
Joey : Oh my god, that is great! That is  for a play on broadway and in
a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time.  
  
Monica : Is it a good play?  
  
Joey : Well, it must be, because I read and I didn't understand a singe
word.  
  
Rachel : Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it  
  
Joey : Yeah, yeah, and directing.  
  
Monica : ( _sighs_ ) He was so good in that movie of MacBeth.  
  
Rachel : ( _disbelieving_ ) You saw that?  
  
Monica : No, but I saw the previews. They played it right before Jackass.  
  
Rachel and Joey : ( _pointing at Monica, a look of recognition in their
faces_ ) Ah!  
  
Joey : Yeah, he's done some amazing works.  
  
Rachel : Oh, yeah. Oh, I loved him in those cell phone commercials.  
  
Joey : ( _almost laughing_ ) I know. When the monkey hits him in the face
with that giant rubber phone. ( _They all laugh_ )  
  
Monica : Hey! Maybe the monkey will be at the audition!  
  
Joey : ( _sitting down_ ) Don't make me more nervous than I already am!  
  
  
[Scene: Chandler's new workplace, his fellow interns are already seated around
a table]  
  
Chandler : ( _entering_ ) Good morning, everybody.  
  
Intern : Can I get you a cup of coffee, Sir?  
  
Chandler : Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guys except for the
tie, the briefcase and the fact that I can rent a car.  
  
Intern : Seriously, you're an intern?  
  
Chandler : Yeah, well, I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and,
you know, you gotta start at the bottom.  
  
Intern : ( _shaking his head disbelievingly_ ) Dude!  
  
Chandler : Right. Look, I know I'm a little bit older than you guys, but
it's not like I'm Bob Hope ( _he sits down_ )  
  
( _Everybody gives him an inquiring look_ )  
  
Chandler : The comedian? USO?!  
  
Intern : ( _correcting him_ ) Uhm, it's USA, sir.  
  
( _Chandler desperately covers his head in his hands_ )  
  
  
[Scene: Audition room, Joey is lead into the room by a receptionist in a fancy
dress]  
  
Receptionist : This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and,
as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.  
  
( _Lennart Haze turns around in his chair to face Joey_ )  
  
Joey : It is so amazing to meet you. ( _They are shaking hands_ ) I'm such
a big fan of your work.  
  
Lennart : Well, I've I've been blessed with a a lot of great roles.  
  
Joey : Tell me about it! "Unlimited nights and weekends!"  
  
Lennart : You making fun of me? Because I am not a sell-out. ( _He stands
up and walks menacingly towards Joey_ ) I didn't do that for the money, I
believe in those phones. I almost lost a cousin because of bad wireless
service.  
  
Joey : No, I-I-I wasn't making fun of you, honestly, I-I think you were
great in those commercials.  
  
Lennart : Really?  
  
Joey : Yeah.  
  
Lennart : Well, I do bring a certain credibility to the role.  
  
Joey : ( _regaining confidence_ ) Are you kiddin'? When they shoot you out
of that cannon  
  
Lennart : Peeeeeooooooooch ( _He mimes flying out of the cannon_ ) "Hang
up that phone!" One take!  
  
Joey : Wow!  
  
Lennart : So, shall we read?  
  
Joey : Oh, yah, sure.  
  
Lennart : Top of act two. This is my entrance. You got it?  
  
( _Joey nods whereupon Lennart acts as if he is entering a room_ )  
  
Lennart : "What the hell are you still doing here"?  
  
( _Joey stares at him, fascinated by his performance_ )  
  
Joey : Err, "I think you know".  
  
Lennart : "Bastard"!  
  
Joey : "I am what you made me. You know what? I could go right now."  
  
Lennart : "Go, go!"  
  
Joey : "I can't. Oh, I want to, long pause, but I can't."  
  
Lennart : I'm sorry, sorry. You're not supposed to say "long pause"  
  
Joey : ( _understandingly_ ) Oh, oh, I thought that was your character's
name, you know, I thought you were like an Indian or something, you know with
a ( _He mimes wearing a feather on his head_ )  
  
Lennart : No. Thank you so much for coming in. We appreciate it, thank
you.  
  
Joey : Ah, y-y-you're sure you don't want me to do it again? I could do it
with an accent, you know, Southern ( _He speaks in what he believes is a
Southern accent_ ) "I could go right now, maaan!"  
  
Lennart : ( _stunned, muttering_ ) My god in heaven.  
  
( _The producers stand up_ )  
  
Producer #1 : Joey, hang on for a second. Lennart, can we talk to you for
a moment?  
  
( _They stand aside, talking_ )  
  
Lennart : You, you gotta be kidding. See, h-he, he can't act. ( _Joey
hears that and his disappointment is reflected in his facial expression_ ).  
  
( _Producer #1 whispers something_ )  
  
Lennart : Hey! I-I-I don't care if he's hot, you know. If you want to
sleep with him, do it on your own time. ( _Joey smiles smugly at this_ ) This
is a play. No, listen: if you insist on this, I will call my agent so fast on
a cell phone that has a connection that is so clear he's gonna think I'm next
door.  
  
( _Joey approaches them_ )  
  
Joey : ( _interrupting their conversation_ ) Ah, hi, ah. Thank you so much
for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what I did
wrong, I'd just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you.
And, and also: ( _to Producer #1)_ 'How you doing?' ( _to Lennart again_ ) You
should, please, just gimme another chance. I really wanna get better, please.  
  
Lennart : Well, if you wanna come back at the end of the day today, here
are my notes. Ready?  
  
Joey : Yeah.  
  
Lennart : Uhm, you're in your head. You-you're thinking way too much.  
  
Joey : I really doubt that.  
  
Lennart : ( _explaining to Joey, who nods_ fervently) No, no, no. It's
that you're not connected with anything in your body. There's no urgency. The
scene is a struggle, uhm, it's a race. Also, what you did was horizontal.
Don't be afraid to explore the vertical. And don't learn the words. Let the
words learn you.  
  
( _Joey ponders on this for a while_ )  
  
Joey : (suggesting) Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?  
  
  
[Scene: Backstreet, Ross and Phoebe walking]  
  
Phoebe : Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight?  
  
Ross : Oh, I can't. I've got a date with that waitress, Katy, yeah, I know
we've been only going out like twice, but I have a really good feeling about
her.  
  
Phoebe : Oh, I hear divorce bells.  
  
( _A mugger, his face hidden by a cap, approaches them from behind_ )  
  
Mugger : Alright. Just give me your wallets and there won't be a problem.  
  
Ross : ( _taken aback_ ) What?  
  
Mugger : I have a gun ( _It looks like he has a gun under his coat_ )  
  
Ross : O-ok. Just relax, Phoene, just stay calm. ( _He searches his coat
and freaks out_ ). Oh my god, I can't find my wallet.  
  
( _He finally finds the wallet and hands it to the mugger_ )  
  
Mugger : Alright, lady, now give me your purse!   
  
Phoebe : No.  
  
Ross : ( _still in a high-pitched voice_ ) What do you mean "no"? I knew
you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay.  
  
( _A sign of recognition runs across Phoebe's face_ )  
  
Phoebe : Lowell, is that you?  
  
Lowell : Phoebe? ( _He lifts his cap_ ) Oh my god!  
  
Phoebe : ( _simultaneously_ ) Oh my god!  
  
( _They hug and scream_ )  
  
Phoebe : ( _excited_ ) I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from
the streets. Lowell, Ross.  
  
Lowell : Ross, nice to meet you. ( _He stretches his hand out to him_ )  
  
Ross : Yeah, a real pleasure.  
  
Phoebe : Ah, it's been so long, so long. ( _They hug again_ ) I can't
believe you're still doing this!  
  
Lowell : Ough, I know, but I quit smoking!  
  
Phoebe : Good for you!  
  
Lowell : So you look like you're doing really well! I guess you're mugging
days are behind you?  
  
Phoebe : Ouh ( _she nods_ )  
  
Ross : ( _shocked_ ) Oh my god. Phoebe, you used to mug people?  
  
Phoebe : Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up  
  
  
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's Apartment, Monica sits on the couch as Joey
enters]  
  
Monica : Hey, how did the audition go?  
  
Joey : Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well,
Lennart Haze did not like me. ( _He sits down_ )  
  
Monica : What happened?  
  
Joey : Well, he said I wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything
I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I
should think less.  
  
Monica : So far so good! ( _Joey nods_ )  
  
Chandler : ( _entering, carrying a large box_ ) Honey, I'm old!  
  
Monica : ( _standing up, walking towards him_ ) What's wrong?  
  
Chandler : I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete
with them.  
  
Monica : So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have
all this life experience.  
  
Chandler : Yes, but I don't think life experience with these. ( _He opens
the box and takes an inline skate-like sneaker out_ )  
  
Joey : Wooooooooow ( _He takes the sneaker_ ) It's like they're on fire!  
_  
Monica : What are they? (They sit down again)  
_  
Chandler : They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how
to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever
where these.  
  
Joey : ( _determined_ ) I give you $ 500 for them!  
  
Chandler : What am I supposed to do with these?  
  
Monica : Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.  
  
Chandler : Well, first of all, they're not called "sneakers" anymore.
Apparently, they're called "kicks" or "skids" and I think I heard somebody say
"slorps". ( _He takes a sneaker_ ) And here, look: they've got these wheels to
pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is
too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity! ( _to
Monica_ ) Would you help me try to sell these?  
  
Monica : Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?  
  
Chandler : No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for.  
  
Joey : Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords?  
  
  
[Scene: Central Perk, Monica sits on the couch as Phoebe and Ross enter]  
  
All : Hey, hey!  
  
Ross : Hey, you'll never guess what just happened Phoebe and I got mugged!  
  
Monica : You okay?!  
  
Ross : ( _sitting down_ ) Yah, because Phoebe knew the mugger!  
  
Monica : ( _bewildered_ ) How do you know a mugger?  
  
Phoebe : I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us.  
  
Ross : You wanna know how she knew him? ( _He points at Phoebe_ ) Because
Phoebe used to mug people.  
  
Monica : ( _shocked_ ) Seriously?  
  
Phoebe : Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know sometimes when I was
living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I  
  
Monica : ( _disapproving_ ) Phoebe, that is awful!  
  
Phoebe : Well, ok, I wasn't rich like you guys, ok, I didn't eat gold and
have a flying pony I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer  
  
Monica : You're mother killed herself!  
  
Phoebe : She was a drug dealer!  
  
Ross : Well, anyway, it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him, because
( _menacingly_ ) I was about to do some serious damage!  
  
Phoebe : ( _laughing_ ) Okay  
  
Monica : Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you,
Ross.  
  
Phoebe : Why?  
  
Monica : Well, Ross was mugged as a kid.  
  
Phoebe : ( _worried_ ) You were?  
  
Ross : Yeah, it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marc's Comics you
know, I-I-I was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what
kinda trouble spiderman got into that week-  
  
Monica : ( _coughing_ ) Wonderwoman!  
  
Ross : Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a
couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone ( _He looks at Monica_ )  when outta
nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says: "Gimme your money, punk!"  
  
Phoebe : ( _shocked_ ) Oh my god  
  
Ross : I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had
all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book: "Science Boy"  
  
Monica : Oh yeah! What was his superpower again?  
  
Ross : A superhuman thirst for knowledge.  
  
Monica : That's it.  
  
Ross : Well, I-I better get to class ( _He stands up_ ) Are there any more
of your friends I should look out for on my way, Phoebe?  
  
Phoebe : No actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane street that's
where stabby Joe works.  
  
(Ross leaves Central Perk)  
  
Phoebe : Okay, I think we have a problem here.  
  
Monica : What?  
  
Phoebe : Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked
St. Marc's Comics.  
  
Monica : Yeah?  
  
Phoebe : Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic
book nerds were my meat.  
  
Monica : So?  
  
Phoebe : Well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack
that said-  
  
Phoebe and Monica : "Geology rocks!"  
  
Monica : Oh my god!  
  
Phoebe : I know I mugged Ross!  
  
  
[Scene: Audition room, the producers and Lennart are waiting for Joey]  
  
Receptionist : You're late!  
  
Joey : ( _entering_ ) I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick
second to run to the bathroom?  
  
Receptionist : No, Lennart doesn't wait!  
  
Joey : But I'm bursting with u-hu!  
  
Lennart : ( _spotting Joey_ ) Joey! Here we go. Let's go very quickly!  
  
Joey : Actually, I really need  
  
Lennart : ( _interrupting_ ) We must go now, quickly, please.  
  
Joey : Yes ahahaaa ( _He seems to be in pain_ )  
  
Lennart : Ready? "What the hell are you still doing here?"  
  
Joey : ( _walking on the spot_ ) "I think you know!"  
  
Lennart : "Oh, you sick bastard!"  
  
Joey : "I am what you made me! You know what?"  
  
Lennart : "What?"  
  
Joey : "I could go right now."  
  
Lennart : "Then go, go!"  
  
Joey : ( _urgent_ ) "I, oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!"  
  
Lennart : Cut! That was good. ( _He turns to the producers_ ) That was
very good. You did everything I asked for.  
  
Joey : ( _disbelieving_ ) I did?  
  
Lennart : Yes. Plus what you've got that I don't know what you've got
going this squirmy quality that you bring into the character that I
couldn't've even imagined. Wow, hey, here's what we gonna do: come back
tomorrow for the final callbacks with the , do all of this what you've got
going now, but  you know what?  more, more. Can you do that?  
  
Joey : Sure, yeah. I don't have time to say thank you because I really
gotta go. ( _He grabs his jacket and limps out of the room_ )  
  
Lennart : ( _watching Joey leave_ ) Look at that: still in character, I
like it I plant seeds I can't explain.  
  
  
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's Apartment, Chander sits on the couch as Monica
and Rachel enter]  
  
Monica : Hey!  
  
Chandler : Hey!  
  
Monica : What are you doing?  
  
Chandler : Putting on the sneakers thought I'd get into a younger mindset,
you know, to see if it sparked anything  
  
Rachel : Oh, anything yet?  
  
Chandler : Yes, how's this: They're so uncomfortable it's like getting
kicked in the nuts for your feet!  
  
( _At that moment, Joey opens the door_ )  
  
Joey : ( _entering_ ) Hey!  
  
All : Hey!  
  
( _Joey heads straight for the fridge, takes all the beverage cans and is
about to leave the apartment_ )  
  
Joey : Probably wanna know what I'm doing ?  
  
Monica : No, that seems about right.  
  
Joey : Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently,
having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking
everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!  
  
Rachel : Joey, that was formula.  
  
Joey : We gotta get more of that. ( _He leaves the apartment_ )  
  
Chandler : ( _sitting on the couch_ ) You know what these aren't half-bad!
( _to Rachel_ ) You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.  
  
Rachel : Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not
allowed to talk to Ralph.  
  
Chandler : Alright ( _He stands wearing the sneakers on_ ) I feel youger
already!  
  
( _He trips and falls hard on his back_ )  
  
Chandler : ( _on the floor_ ) Yah, I think I broke my hip.  
  
  
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is there drinking coffee and Ross is about to
enter]  
  
Phoebe : ( _spotting Ross_ ) Hey, you!  
  
Ross : Hey!  
  
Phoebe : Hey, how was class?  
  
Ross : No one ever asked me that, what's wrong?  
  
Phoebe : Nothing, I really wanna know.  
  
Ross : Oh ( _He looks positively surprised_ ) Well, uhm, there was
actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene  
  
Phoebe : ( _interrupting_ ) Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a
confession to make uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you
were a kid  
  
Ross : (disbelieving) Wh-What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl. It
was this huge dude.  
  
Phoebe : You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a
fourteen year-old girl.  
  
Ross : No, it wasn't.  
  
Phoebe : Yes, it was.  
  
Ross : No, it wasn't. You don't think I would've defended myself against a
fourteen year-old  
  
Phoebe : ( _interrupting, pinching his year_ ) "Gimme your money, punk!"  
  
Ross : ( _shocked_ ) Oh my god, it was you! I can't believe it, you you
mugged me?  
  
Phoebe : ( _apologetic_ ) Yeah, and I'm so, so sorry, Ross, I'm sorry,
but, you know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat. ( _She smiles at him,
but he doesn't understand_ ) I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt
kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that
go way back and, you know, now, you and I have have a great one!  
  
Ross : It's not the best!  
  
Phoebe : I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say  
  
Ross : (indignant) There's nothing you can say. That was the most
humiliating thing that ever happened to me.  
  
Phoebe : Really? Even more humiliating than  
  
Ross : ( _interrupting_ ) Hey, let's not do this!  
  
( _He picks up his briefcase and walks out of the door, leaving Phoebe behind_
)  
  
  
[Scene: Chandler's new workplace, we are witnessing a presentation of a fellow
intern]  
  
Intern :  and then, at the end of the commercial, the girls get out of the
hut tub and start making out with each other!  
  
Boss : ( _ironic_ ) That's interesting! Just one thought: You didn't
mention the shoes. Who's next? (C _h_ andler _raises his hand_ ) Chander  
  
Chandler : Okay ( _He stands up_ ) You start on the image of a guy putting
on the shoes. He's about my age  
  
Intern : (snorting) Your age?  
  
Chandler : A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose
control, you know maybe he falls maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes
flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the
line reads: "Not suitable for adults!"  
  
Boss : Chandler, that's great!  
  
Chandler : Oh, thank you, sir or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me ( _He
sits down again_ )  
  
Boss : You see? That has a clear selling point. It appeals to our key
demographic, it's . ( _enthusiastic_ ) You did you come up with that?  
  
Chandler : (over-enthusiastic) I don't know, I don' I don' know! I was
just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to
flow.  
  
Boss : That is great. Good work!  
  
Chandler. Thank you.  
  
Boss : See all of you tomorrow. ( _He leaves_ )  
  
(Chandler stands up and walks out the room with a cane)  
  
Chandler : The cold weather hurts my hip!  
  
  
[Scene: Central Perk, Ross sits in a chair as Phoebe enters]  
  
Phoebe : Hey, Ross! ( _He lowers his newspaper and scowls at her_ ) I know
you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second?  
  
Ross : Sure, go ahead. Whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead. ( _He raises his
hands as if being mugged_ )  
  
Phoebe : I just really wanted to apologize again and and also show you
something I think you'll find very exciting.  
  
(She puts a box on her lap, labelled "crap from the street")  
  
Ross : ( _faking enthusiasm_ ) Oh my god, crap from the street? ( _She
smiles excitedly, but Ross just turns back to his newspaper_ )  
  
Phoebe : Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging
that I thought were too special to sell or smoke. ( _Ross looks at her in
astonishment_ ) Anyway, I was looking through it and I found "Science Boy" (
