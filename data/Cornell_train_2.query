A flaw I'm working on.
It isn't right to make him suffer...
I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
Spencer of the Chronicle .
A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right...  Okay, on three:  One... Two...
... Are you sure you like it?
Hey -- I'm over here.
So, not married.  Well, good for you.  You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?
I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
Yes, yes, but...
He told you that...
The one Superman wrecked up?
You don't feel cold?
We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.
Buzz Gundersen.
Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
Yes -- all right --
I don't suppose....
Yo, Traxler.
I thought you didn't.
For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
I know that.
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
What's wrong?
And now ladies and gentlemen it's time for the fabulous CROCODILE SHOW !
I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
me up the...
We can't leave him out here, open the door.
I'm sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.
Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?
General -- we have to talk sometime!
I don't see my container.
So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?
Who's cursed?
How's that?
Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that possible?
This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?
We're building up tourism, Sam--
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do."  Aren't you part of them anymore...?  Aren't you part of the FBI? 'No Girl's Allowed,' or <u>what</u>?  Have you transgressed...?
Mookie, late again.  How many times I gotta tell you?
I better go.
Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're my cross to bear-
Which one is that?  Raw what?
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
Help cook?
Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
Really.
Thank God, it's up to you, Pal.  Sup to you...
Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
College?
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
Yes.
No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
That was you guys, huh?
It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.
Would you like a Coke or something?
Tell me, why don't you go and get your medal?
You're not afraid of anything, are you?
I completely understand...
Yes?
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
What took you so long?
Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like?
Takin' a bath.
Elliot?
When, may I ask?
I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
Jabez -- help!
What do you do?
Here, Captain.
All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
I don't...
"I know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars". Revelations II.
We're only going to be here a few hours...
Last I knew.
Just think about it.
Negative.
Me? Four years.
We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
No. I've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day.
Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
Money never sleeps pal. When I came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, London's deregulated, the Orient is hungrier than us. Just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying. I just made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold. It's been wired to you -- play with it. You done good, but you gotta keep doing good. I showed you how the game works, now school's out.
Do you always begin conversations this way?
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
Now, mostly dead is slightly alive. Now, all dead...well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do.
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
My man Dubbs.
Do you still want to do something tonight?
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
No I quit.
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
She did that deliberately.

How long had that been going on?
Well, you obviously don't know me.
My Lord?
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
Then what?
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
How's the beautiful lady?
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
Oh, that's so interesting!
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
Hey, where'd this come from?
Well, that'll happen.
How do you open the damn door?
I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
I don't want to go to lunch.
Just a little.
What is it?
I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
But what --
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
You know me better than that.
None.
. . . What?
It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!
...on!
So you're not gonna make the movie?
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
Not until you do that thing I like.  On se tue pour des mesnonges. J'ai gache ma vie...  Woah. Harsh toke.
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
But you did suspect me.
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
Danny... what's the matter, hon?
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
But, Rose, what is the cause of it all?
Hello! You're like, a lawyer.
It's a flare.
The same. Same as what?
Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  Even I don't understand it sometimes.  Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...
No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
Damn --  Yes -- I --  -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship.  We could never be anything else.  We're just so... different.
Riordan?
I think it's still available.
When did you start to feel this way?
What would you do for me?
Yes, I will.
What?
Who are you?
What's this?
You wouldn't?
What the?...
But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
Where?
How about White?
Sorry, comb got caught.
David.  There's a call for you.  It's your wife.
Which one is your brother?
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
I have a family, Mary.
What's the damage?
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I am Augusto Oliveras.
In time for what?
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
Why doesn't Dexter show some decency? And you might show some too, Mother. What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names?  I'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart. He deserved it.
I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
... Aye sir...?
I don't think so.
I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. Preysing telephoned.
Well, your condition's pretty serious.
Good-bye, brother!
Absolutely.
I'll bite. What's the catch?
So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
Who paid you to see me off?
Say hello to Thorn.
She didn't.  She just left.
...Why don't I just type this up...
Too busy looking after themselves.
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work teaches us humility.
It's just talk, he's drunk.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
Probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall. He worked a lotta time on this.
Myers?
What's a buzzer?
Not once?- you didn't hit it once?-
It's okay by me, peanut.
The extortion, the threats ...
He is traveling with a lady.
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3 networks!
Well...?
Are you talking?
You what?
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?  Now, there was a model boy!
Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
You could use the grade, huh?

It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen...
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
I aspire to be more than I am.
He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.
Who is this?
What was your mother like?
I know you just want to punish me --
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
The day you got me out of jail?
Can I look at the pictures?
She's using a new perfume.
The honey trap.  And there's the honey.
He's been here.
The Shazzammeter!
Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
Fruit.
Stupid.
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
You see!  You see!
He's pissing in our faces again and we're just taking it.
So you didn't go to school together.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
You never spoke to me before.
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
You- Do you love me?
She lived there.
They don't have to.
I like.  When do movie shoot?
And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
Taken care of?
Who...who...
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
Yeah - Josephine.
They stopped serving two hours ago.
Brief marriage!  Ten years!
You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to.
I never took the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u> test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?
...and they sit down right next to me...
Good.
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
That's cor...
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
He say anythin'... The Kid... ?
You're in violation.
Will it?
What was it like?
I'll take you down there.
I'm talking about prayer.
Let's get this straight right now. We wouldn't have been late at all if it wasn't for you.
Gimme the ball!
Come look at this.
Funny couple, ain't they?
What?  Right Here?
It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
Thanks.
Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two.
That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
He wants a lot of money.
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
Sir?
Wow! Look at all these creeps!
If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.
Get up, Willa.
Get out of the car, spread them. You can jawbone all you want or you have the right to <u>shut the fuck up</u>! You commie motherfucker. Either way you're goin' to the can.
Don't bother.
This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
We can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably.
You've got quite a temper.  It's better this way.
How many of you are there?
He's alive!
Rewind that.
Why not ?
Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
He was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
We're no leaving you!
General Jack D. Ripper, sir.
Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.
She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
Congratulations.
Dr. Towler...
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
This afternoon?
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
It does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in <u>sheets</u>!
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.
Exactly.
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
What've you got there?
Serious stuff...
Now that's true!
All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
Who the fuck are you?
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
Is this your first job?
Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!
The "skylight?" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
What's that?
Do you want to rest a bit?
Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!
Well...Annie for one.
They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?
Greetings, everyone.
He stole my report! That's my report!
This is her family and her fault.
Left...The one with the red dot.
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
I wish dawdie was with us.
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
Who?
My wife? What's she got to do with you?
I don't <u>think</u> so.
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
Were you with another man?
Yeah --
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.
No.
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
Modelling.
Yes.
No, we're just...
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
I discovered this. SEC filing...  For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.
She has materialized from your memory of her.  What was her name?
He's... dreamy.  He's...
Yeah.
Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
Oh my God... Ted.  What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since --
Then what's...
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
Who said that?
Gwen, my wife's dead.
Your --
I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
What're you doing here, Roy?
What did he say?
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
Why pick on him ?
Somebody must live here!
So you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good.
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
Your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie.
Let's hear it.
Ahh!  Baby's got two heads!!!
It's lovely.
I don't know. I don't have it with me.
'Bout an hour ago.
That's right on time.  This is my friend, Vito.  His pops is Sal.
There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.
If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.  Marla...the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can't.
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
I admit I don't know where he is.
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
How are you? How's business?
You're kinda the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
Susanville.
Is that so?
The cost-efficient reporter.
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
Yes.
I'd like to.
Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?
What can I do for you?
What music?
Yes.
Idaho?
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
Oh, them? Well, no--them's *two* for a penny.
An excellent question, Doctor.  But what if we don't like the answer?
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
I can't take any more school.
Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.
The dynamite...
What'll they do to him?
--I'm not angry at you--
How many onions does it say to use?
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
Bud--I thought you wanted to come home.
I can check on that for you, maybe we can take a tour --
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
Thank you.  You saved my life. What's your name?
No.  What am I to do?
Next time, it might be the FBI. The time after that, it might be the President.  But it'll always be someone.  Count on it.
...and awduhs a light lunch.
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
Oh great!
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
No.
Bought it.
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
Pretty as a picture.
Who?
Affirmative.
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment.  What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears.  But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities.  DOES IT?
Put his feet in.
Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one.  Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery?
What a shame.
Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room.  Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you.  I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you.  I missed my wife.  We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh --  I love you.  You complete me.
The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy.
Yes, it is very good!
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
My name is --
It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
I am?
I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here...  We've got to get to the radio and call for help.
That's what everybody says.
I am the desert, where water disappears--
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
Think you could learn?
I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
There's this guy!
All right.
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.
Did you do it for Tim?
I told him about your car.
She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed her?
We're gonna change it, Bugs. Once we get rid of the Dons, the Commission's gonna rule. No more wars. No more vendettas. No more Boss of All the Bosses.
Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it.
Yeah?
I don't think so.
Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
REALLY?
Your father asked you a question.
You're not my list.
No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy.
Be careful, dude.
Fucking.
That's right.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
What difference does it make whether he			* was your guy or not?						    *
Who is it?
Good Lord.
Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying.
Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
He might just wait us out.
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
Did Romeo have a name?
It's never happening again. Right?
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
My Jesus
I gave him this new face.
You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
I certainly do!
I'm...
I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
Hesitated, sir.
I'm talking about you.
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
What's the matter?
We had a tough year.
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
And who are we auditioning for today?
I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that!  We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
Phil, hang in just one more minute ok?  I'm gonna put you on hold -- Doc you still there?
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Bah, for that matter, Algeria isn't the only country in the world ...
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
This could be it.
On a plane back to Sicily.
I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
Where the hell were you?
It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don't hate her.  I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness.
Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid it grows!
A name. Grunemann. Nothing. And they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing. Then they asked me, well had I been getting letters, from someone out there in Cabbageville --
Accident.
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
Let's wait for some slow one.
His pistol must of jammed.
What're you talking about, man?  I don't understand.
Lights?
They're not delivering.  I'm going to go pick up the pizza.
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
What do you think you are doing?
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
Are you going with her?
It's alright.
Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet?  That dog don't hunt.
Excuse me?
You girls are in some hot water.
It's not really something I think about.
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
What?
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
As you say, Doctor.
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
I've got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go.
How did you know -- ?
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
'We?'
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
Martin.
A word? I'm sure by now he's engineered a hostile takeover.
Negative effect.
How long have you known her?
Get rid of Dodd for me.
Not at all, John.
My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
We'll try.
Heh'o Tom.  This is Connie, my husband.
For Jefferson High. For books.
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.
What?
I don't know. No, not really I suppose. But I've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual.
Mr. Gardner, I --
I have a question...
No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
Do I?  I'm a little confused.
The enemy is matching velocity.
Got it.
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
What's with you guys?
I mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? I don't get it. Don't they get confused? "Is that mine? I thought it was yours." Hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative... I think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is.
That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.
You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?
Two wavy lines?
What does that fucking mean?
I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.
Maybe you should drive him into Devil's Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him.
What?  What did you say?
You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
...Not enough food?
Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about-
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
Happy for him.  And relieved.
Excuse me?
You got a special friend, Jimmy?
You are to be executed at Dawn anyway.  Might as well commit the crime. Go to her, Wichita...
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive.  And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace.  Until now.
I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
When is mommy coming back?
Yes... I... we had dinner.
That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
Right.
She's going to leave you -
Not really...
Forgive me if I have offended you.
I'm sorry.
Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
You sure got a way with women, bro.  What happened up there?
A son.
What?
Yeah?
OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.
Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard.  I called you earlier about a book.
No, Doctor.
McKendrick's men got him.
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
All right then.
Friends of yours, huh?
The Day Walker's blood is a disparador -- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra's return. One need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him.  "And the Sleeper will rise from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a Tide of Blood."
To find the head, sir?
I need you to do me a favor.
From your mouth.
That only leaves the rest.
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
A week ago, at most.
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
You're joking.
I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it.
What?
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.
How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
To run last?
Shorthand. Really?
Where is it?
Just coolin'.
Chris, what if I were to cut you in as partner in this project - together we could make it swing, all it needs is a good clean out and the power on, then we're in business.
No doubt the Precogs have already seen this.
We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  Teb, reset the pod, we're going back.
But now you've strayed from your area of expertise -- dope -- into street assassins. A subject on which you're dangerously ignorant.
You can't.
See if you can guess.
A foreign land full of millions of Italian men...  speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
You like me, huh?
Jesus Christ!
Just like that?
They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
I put everything in my room.  My Teddy bear is joining us.
I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on parole.  I can't leave the state.
Alright, good.  Thanks for your trouble. So will you leave Sally and me alone right now?
Why's that?
He goes to college with me!
And when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction XJ6 was really about...
They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
Maybe not, but why take chances?
...T-thank you.
Yeah, right.
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
You missed him? You didn't...?
You swine!
Shut up!  Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?
You stay inside. I will see to them.
Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.
I'm sure you should have failed.
No problem.
What?
Britain chooses not to.
All things possible in Babylon.
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
The name of the show?
Yes, charming.
Rush her.
I am your wife.
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
Give him evidence.
Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great.
Only we call them agents.
We want Mrs. Peel.
What'd I tell you?
I wasn't helping you for money.
Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot.
Bob.
And I really wanted some ice cream too.
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...
Because I'm in love with you.
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
What about it?
Of course. I planned that, too.
We did it.
You have his address?
I'll bet it's been done.
Hello Lydia?
Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
What the hell are you talking about --
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.
Thanks.
That's preposterous!  We have no such program!
Don't do this
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
Oh, Hannah!
Look, I'm as worried as you are --
I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?
"They?"
What number did you tear out?
I know the one.
No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
Otis!
No.
I hope you're right.  I really do.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Keep stallin'.
Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
Who'd you call?
He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.
Jump, Timmy!  It's too late!
Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.
How do you get it out?
It's over for you.
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
Bob.
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
Scottie --
We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves?
What...?
They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own.
You're gonna explain.
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
Yeah?
What?
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin body.
No doubt.
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions, no security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks.
I think while we're waiting, we had better run some basic diagnostics on you.
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
That's a good thing?
...that's our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd still tear into a guy I saw kicking a dog. Not that *he* is, by a long shot--
Is that... machine...?
What have we missed?
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
You take care of your family?
Shelly, you blew the last...
Whistler!
Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.
You've heard of U.S.T.?
Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
You're serious.
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
Don't you get it? In one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue.
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
Well, I think it's charming, Rose.  But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
No!
Then we're stupid and we'll die.
I'm really lost.  What does this have to do with walking?
Yeah. He went to Harward.
I don't think I'll be running into him.
Is that all you want?
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
The boss won't notice me doing a bad job because I'm not. Even if the boss thought I was slacking I'd know right away.
No wonder we both struck out with her. Who can compete with the sexual power of the man who occupies the highest office in the land?
What time is your rendezvous?
You must have some idea about him.
Colt Peacemaker.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
Wit-tay.
I am preparing for a ball!
You don't fish.
I've got enough here.
What?
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
We're with Ruiz.
And a fact is a fact.
It's a good script, isn't it?
Saw me --
This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
There've been some calls.
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.
Because you're in trouble.
I know that.
Whu --
You won't keep growing at this rate.
Happy birthday.
Did you miss me?
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
Where did you get this?
Somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on.
Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
Look at me! I'm your baby!  Get a load of that blonde one! Built like a brick Kremlin!
And fifty bucks a lead.
You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that.
Oh!
...A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud.
Hey, you know better than that.  What did I teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?
I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
No.
Happy Birthday, man.
Well, it's not very plain.
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
Enjoy.  Well --
Phillip?
They're waiting to see my father.
What do we do if there isn't?
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
Why?
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
Hitchhiking?
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.
Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...
Yes, where?
Saliva test?  You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.
Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?
You'll be back.
No, Rex is not going to die.  Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
Who gave you this idea?
As you were. Lieutenant...?
I think we should go...
I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
It is kind of you to make this effort.
It's a guy you know.
Land reform is underway in Amdo. The large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. Landlords are being punished.
Lara called me.
So what should I do with the pudding?
Comment va-t-elle?
Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.
Yes, I did.
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
What thing?
They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.
This is very good for us.
Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point.  That's not the point at all!
You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
Officer White?
Fag.
And that is?
We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with.
But what?
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
Are you alright?
They'd never sail this close to the shore.
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.
Damn.  Damn!  If I could just get Chris to read this poem!
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
It's up to you now, Angel!
And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!
This is he?
Why does he always pick on me?
You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Ignorant.  The thing's ignorant.
I want to go back!
Packing.
You know where she is?
I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him...
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
He won't last one round.
Moose.
And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family?
What I never could figure about the movie?
Same as you. Ten thousand.
No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.
Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
...and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl...
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
It's all here...
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
Not bad.  But if you gotta wear a cast, you oughtta feature it more it's parta the story.  Network's taking everything we give 'em.  They wanta feed off our six o'clock whether we find the mystery guy or not.  We're very big nationally.
...That's what's important.
Mother Mary, full of grace.
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
We're going to speak to her.
Oh, my God, look at her!
Why not? I mean, I'm having fun... At least I'm not bitching.
Sound?
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's.
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.
Oh-oh! TouchÃ©, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh?  No. Don't. You might get confused speaking of things you don't understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until you've done what we are paying you for.
Son, you're an ant after my own heart.  A warrior.  An ant that looks death right in the face and <u>laughs</u>.
Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
Hi, Hank.
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
They're overly protective.  You're Not going to hurt me are you, Ms...
Perhaps you did not have the <u>support</u> you required.
Vada!!
Of course, Finch.  What?
I heard him say it.
Mr.  Flavors -- may I have a moment of your time?
-- He killed people --
Ellen.
Yes?
Feel better now?
Get lost Bobby.
How are you?
Yeah. See?
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
But she wanted more out of life, right?
You heard what I said, Dil?
Fix my glasses.
The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
Here we are.  Do you want to come up?
Will you be alone?  The merchandise. Is it just you or...
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
Of course not.
How did they get it away from him?
Fuck you Boyd!
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
No.
I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
No.
Certainly would, Joseph.
Hey, it's... been two years --
Hold it, hold it. What's tonight?
Do his job.
Maybe later.
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
And so they kill the goose.  I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to...
Hello.
Did you see that?
It's nine-thirty in the morning.
You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
I gave you my card there.
Relax!
Thank you very much.
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
I sent it to myself in Paris.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
I know.
-- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought --
Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
Now tell me you love me.
No worries ...
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
And I'm the feet.
Max, I...
Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
How are you?
You should be in hospital.
They were all wearing hardware.
Count it.
Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
Well, my boy, you're a hero.
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
What are you talking about?
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
I beg your pardon?
You awake?
Get me a Dr. Peppa!  I don't want no Pepsi.  Pepsi ain't nothing but flavored water.
Give me a yell is something happens.
One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
Thanks for the drink.
Harry!
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
I'm okay with that.
Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.
St. Michael's.
Yeah, one of them's out.
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
Why not?
Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter.  So what?
Yeah.  Drag, huh?
Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
That's what you want, isn't it?
I don't know anybody.
Yes, but I wouldn't...
I guess not...
I know that.
Investigator Rimgale.
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
So how come you don't have any kids?
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
It was you who did the asking.
Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
If thou lose hope being weary in the days of distress, thy strength shall be diminished.
I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
They're turning around.
And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.
You gonna stay out here?
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
No, Sandro... Please...
The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.
You think so?
Does she say so?
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
What the fuck does that mean?
You see, the bag has just been found, and the reaction of relief from her former excitement and strain is just a little too much for her. It's not very serious, but just the same we'd better not take any chances.
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?
What do you care?
Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything.
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
What exactly are you working on?
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
I don't know how.
I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less and less air time.  They don't think I'm at all anchor material.
Have you ever been in Messina, son?
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
Hold your horses.  What kinda source?
Where do you kill them...
Of course!  Ivo Shandor,  I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE.  He started a secret society in 1920.
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
What, what's there to <u>think</u> about?  The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...
I hope she's all right.
Oh, um...
Is Julia here?
Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
Just me.
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
So, what's next?
'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Yeah!
In the Winnebago.
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
[How do I recognize him.]
What do you want?
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
Looks all right-
The Penny Saver sucks.
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
You didn't think to ask?
About what?
Yes!
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
What about the legalities of this...?
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
-- as we will be.
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
I'm gonna miss you.
"Frank" was my mother's father.
Lets see, it was before he moved to L.A... four years April.
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
Mmm...
For what he made me go through.
Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
What word did you leave last night?
That'd be Lily.
I'm sure you'll be all right.
The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging.
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
I don't understand. Why did you want to come here? I mean, I can't imagine Ann painted a very flattering portrait of me.
Christ, sure... yes!
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
What?
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
Son! -- Out of the water now!
So I've heard--
Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.
Le mot d'ordre?
Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police.
What? What? What? What? What?
This morning.
Let me go! I wanna see him!
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
OK.
No. Thank you.
What hotel?
What do you know?
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
You're so sweet.
Body double.
Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
I've got all these signs here...
Listen to her singing.
Nine?
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
The Emperor?
What does it say.
Here, this belongs to you.  It was empty when I found it.
So go dance.
What the hell are you doing here?
I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
Miss Ratched. Given all the conditions of that sublime relationship, coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that I held to be sacred, mentally, physically and emotionally, the only thing that I can speculate on, at this late date, is how I will justify the very existence of my life, with or without my dear wife.
Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
Yeah?
Not since you lost him.
I guess.
Take him off the air.
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
Lara, please...
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
It's just a mongoose.
Married?
Not that I recall.
Well, I want to...
Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.
We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.  We're gonna plug a leak.
Just, just take it easy, Walter.
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
What's this?
Nah, you go on.
You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.
Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
That doesn't make sense.
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out!
Hi.
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
Then what is it?
Why are you following me?
What is it, my son?
How do you play reality.
Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.
Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded.
Melissa Margaret Marr, Celebrity.
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
How do I even know which one has it?
Smart. London, eh?
We've done it before.
What have we missed?
Your treat.
This is a place for workmen.
No.
I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
I don't know.  My friends...
But it ends up the same.
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist."
It's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct.
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
KRYPTONITE!
Relax.  I got a nervous man here with a magnum up my nose.
The 'patrone' is here.
But we've got to verify it legally To see...
Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
Yes, it is.
Oh, Al ... This is just...
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
Erica is in the van back there.
Jack Gordon.
No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
You're going to live here permanently?
The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
What is it?
No.
Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do you...
Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
What?
...where is the Back End coming from?
Did he say a wolf?
I love you.
Doesn't that come next?
I certainly hope so.
No, I don't belong here.
I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
Beautiful.
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
You're happy, aren't you?
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?
You think we'll ever come back?
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
Bugger off.
So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
Somebody's there, Barry.
Where was you, Daddy?
Not this again --
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
Without any clothes on?
No. Do you?
Did you bring it with you?
Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
Two pounds, fourteen ounces.
What's this in favor of?
Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
It's not "war."  It is a <u>Pageant</u>.  It's a <u>Pageant</u>... Like the Oscars... why we came to <u>you</u>...
You can't have a war without an enemy.
A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
Yes, indeed.
So I gathered.
I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.
And what would that be, sir?
She works for them.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
Sure thing. Put them here... I'll take them.
Do we stand for the same things that the "Chronicle" stands for, Mr. Bernstein?
We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
Whew.
It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.
Why can't I go out there with you?
What about the rest of my comic books?
Our chance to do what?
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
Oh . . .
I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
Whose side are you on?
That's on time for Margo.
That is idle talk.
I don't understand.
You first.
No, man. I want you to have it.
-- And keep your eyes on the road.
Don't take that.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
Her old boyfriend?
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
Stop.
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING.
Yes.
Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
See that, Col?
But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
Like what?
I had to get in, to meet Margo! I had to say something, be somebody, make her like me!
Because she's my...my...
One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun.
Yeah, but --
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
Been waiting long?
What are you so scared of?
Sure. You boys want anything?
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.  Yes, I know.
So now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope that the cops never found and disappear for a while until I got things straightened out.
I am, Your Eminence
Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...
...easy, easy, easy.
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
I will do it.
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
Could be the weight of the snow.
She is not your birth mother, is she?
But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
I don't know.  I'm just not.
Do I know you?
Lettuce and tomato?
The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds.
It's not the gas, Dad!
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
So tell me about the Times article.
I'm the man they're 	protecting. I'm the President. I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.
I don't mean to be inquisitive. But this <CMDF> -- for all I know it could stand for <Consolidated Mobilization of Female Delinquents>?
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
Why's she blind, Bro?
You're a week early.
Let's go, Duff.
Father...?
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
What are you carrying, Willy?
She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk to.
Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
Hello...?
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
Cooper...
I been told to take your car in, Sir.
He had his hand on her titty.
Yes, the roving nurse...
You found her?
Need any company?
Damn right I'm done.  I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
Okay.  What do you do when you don't have a witness?
Not yet.
Are you still on mediction?
As a nurse.
Ignore her?
The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
Yes
My recommendation: Do me. Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick. Would if I were you.
To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag!
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
I told you I don't like to talk about it.
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
Loretta, never have kids.
I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail...  I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!
Oh, yes you are.
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
Have a drink.
Why Johnny Ringo, you look like Somebody just walked over your grave.  Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I Made out.
HEY!!!
Did you find the knife, Sergeant?
How can I let you leave; how can I let you take my children away? Don't you know me?  You understand, it's an impossibility.  I would never let it happen; no, never, not if it took all my strength, all my cunning.  But in time, soon, you'll feel differently.  You see, you'll be happy that I stopped you.  I know you.  You'll forget about this; you'll forget about the baby we lost... and we'll go on, you and I.
Ted!
Who warned you?
Oh no. No visa.
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
No.
What is our condition?
How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?
Why?
What a coincidence, cause I was just thinking about you, too, Jack.  Recognize this?
Yeah.
Look after him.
Sean!   Catch the rope!
Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
You're staring at me.
Norman!
This afternoon - at four o'clock.
Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?
That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!
Linda Cooksey?
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
What the hell does it mean?
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
ABC.
Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!
And what are we going to do now?
Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
Here--where are you running off to?
God, if Chet found out he'd...
The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.
I've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right!
...Who are you?
You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
ALAN!
How do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?
Once I even told him I loved him.
He can't stay up there.
I'm sorry?
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local- that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady- well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out- we take our cut.
About a year and a half.
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.

How long to fix?
You makin' any headway?
C'mon...
He said something about being between things.
Father Marchena!
I told Mother I took care of you.
I don't care what she wears.
Stevens?
Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.
He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
Bill --
Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.
Can I be anyone I want?
It's hurting.
I don't know what he's talking about.
I'm really sorry!
What's going on?
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
SING!
You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.
Pointing upwards Look...
You've got to be kidding.
Where?
Bollocks, I'm sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult.
That wasn't me.
I am husband?
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
After we eat, Dad.
They fired everyone.
Can I keep it?
I don't recall.
In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
Exercising my visitation rights.
And so did I.
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
What if you don't make it?
My name is AL.
You go in for dangerous things.
Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
Well... yes.
Fuck!  Fuck!  How did you ...  Awwww goddammit!
Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.
Oh, sure.  Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?
It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
You hated West more than any of us.
I guess not.
Hello, Jack.
What do you mean you're not a Christian?  Of course you're a Christian, we're all Christians...
Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.
Hi dad.
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
I don't know.
Yes.
What about you?
I would like to change your name.
What the "Bowsprit Affair"?
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.
I didn't say that I would run... I just...
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
He said something about...
Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
Hi.  Is Frank there?
Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
Of course.
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
I don't know about totally.
I guess I did.
The Mayor's outside.
Yeah, sure, I guess.
You can't do it.
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
I'm going this morning.
Sorry about that Harry, first time I've brought a friend up there. You okay?
I don't remember.
I can't believe this...  What's coming now, eh? If I don't pay all Hell's gonna break loose, is that it?
Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The birds.
And Jim.
There's nothing wrong with this place.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort.
That was close --
pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
What's this?
It will?
Nobody's too busy.
The old boy shot by the highway?
Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?
What do you mean?
Oh yeah, I remember now.
Are we going in this?
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.
I got your message and came as quick as I could.
Who with?
You don't want to answer... Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away.
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
Ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation.
While we walk.  D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies.  No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for.
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
Okay.  Good night.
Still tagging conch?
Sir, before you boot me, I just want to explain.  I mean, okay, you got a goat-guy with a hook for a head...
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
You work here, Keith?
I read the same article...
If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
Yes, dear!
Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
Close!
A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
Where did you mail them?
Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
The woman was in shock.  She was totally out on ranks.  I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack.  Stop that, you son of a bitch!  The place wasn't secure.  I was doing my goddamn job!  And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room.
Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me.
With you.
I...what?  Are you, are you, that's why...?  Are you nuts?  I'm...I'm going to close for you, I'm going to...  Here, here, I'm going to make this office...I'm going to be back there Number One...Hey, hey, hey!  This is only the beginning...List...list... listen. Listen.  Just one moment. List...here's what...here's what we're going to do.  Twenty percent. I'm going to give you twenty percent of my sales...  Twenty percent.  For as long as I am with the firm.  Fifty percent.  You're going to be my partner.  Fifty percent.  Of all my sales.
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?
Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
No children?
It's so infernally cold in here.
Jesus--what's got into Nuke?
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
Uh-huh. Want one?
Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
You're upset.
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
Looks like that's not all they admired.
...Hello?
It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.
Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?
No, I love you, really.
They record everything their video surveillance takes in...
And how come you call yourselves Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.
I can't stay.
Nope.
Maybe so.
Excuse me?
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
--Cotter--
Cat.  That's simple.  I like it.  Hi, Cat.
Yes.
Hold those rights.
Hey, Herbie...
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
Me? What can I do?
But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
I'm sure it isn't.
The only arrangement I'll accept is full investment.  Period.  The whole eight units.  I know that you're saying 'be safe,' I know what you're saying.  I know if I left you to yourselves, you'd say 'come back tomorrow,' and when I walked out that door, you'd make a cup of coffee...you'd sit down...and you'd think 'let's be safe...' and not to disappoint me you'd go one unit or maybe two, because you'd become scared because you'd met possibility.  But this won't do, and that's not the subject..." Listen to this, I actually said this. "That's not the subject of our evening together." Now I handed them the pen.  I held it in my hand. I turned the contract, eight units eighty-two grand. "Now I want you to sign."  I sat there.  Five minutes.  Then, I sat there, Ricky, twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Not a word, not a motion. What am I thinking? "My arm's getting tired?" No.  I did it.  I did it.  Like in the old says, Ricky.  Like I was taught... Like, like, like I used to do...I did it.
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
I don't think a week's gonna do it.
Yes?
I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?
I'm not crowding you, am I?
A man wouldn't do that...
I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy.  You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies.  You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.
What's goosed?
I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
Is that a serious offer?
No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
Detonation in twenty minutes.
Fabulous!
All you got to do is lay down an' watch.
Yes. She bought my sister's business.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
Yeah, my feet are cold...
I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
Just a few cells away from a vast air chamber -- one of the countless Alvioli of the Lung -- and we can't get enough to fill a microscopic tank.
Are you all squeaky clean now?
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
Who's they?
Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
Do you like porno movies?
When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.
Take any one ya like.
What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
Yes.
Why should I believe you?
When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.
But it was horrible.
The picture looks blurry.
Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you.
All this talk about love, it's silly.
Like how?
Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
I thought it was tremendous.
What are you doing?
No...
Oh my God, I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you.
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
Was this during Betty?
Talk.  No tricks, no codes, no messages.  You haven't found us. It was a fake call.
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
No.
It's siesta.
I think I should come with you.
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
We have a radio like this, too.
You broke my nose.
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?
That's precisely what they need.  Some uninterrupted REM sleep to release all this negative energy.
Why are you stopping?
Watch this.
Hey, you smell that?  Smells like Something died.
Burke!  Open the door!
Did you?
I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
I don't know.
Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me.
Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
I beg your pardon, sir?
Yes, O'Reilly?
You need a meal ticket is what you mean.  Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
...we had a script conference...
Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands.  'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
I was wondering whether you'd come at all..
I think Maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
Good-bye.
What can we do?
You had sex with you therapist?
We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
Sorry man...
Viktor, it's my studio.
I'll just shoot him once.
That's all right... I grow on people.
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
We'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here.  Barbara and I worked very hard on this house.
Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.
Yes.
What do you think?
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
I guess not.
I can't resist. You usually move through here so quickly and I have so many questions I want to ask you. You have no idea what your work means to me.
Is this about the funny money?
What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party?
We're quoting Mom again.
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.
Since I was a child, I've always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldn't rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
Alright!  She did good!  Didn't she?
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
Ok.
Why do you think --
And what?  What?  She was Driven From Her Home, by Albanian Terrorists.  It is her we are mobilizing to defend... it is "she"?
Spock, that was actually funny.
The small ball.
The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  What took you?
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
I've been in here before.
I don't know, man. Ask him?
Okay. We can stop that.
Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
Congratulations, sir.
What about me?
One of 'em must have escaped.
You said nobody came in here!
Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
I see...
No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
How about tonight?
When did I say I hated you?
Will the Senator yield for a question?
Was it him or you?
I don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. This cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.
It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
Nothing to tell.
Good.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
But you'll never be whole again.
Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold people's hands, while they die.  What'd you say your problem was...
I just don't want to go.
Come on --
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
It used to make me laugh, but.
You're not.  Where is it?
I didn't say I thought we should have saved him..
But...
Red.
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him.
Lando, grab it!
Yeah, it's like tradition or something.
No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.
Back to New York for starters.
Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
Fuck you.  Anyway, Minister Farrakhan always talks about the so-called "day" when the Black man will rise.  "We will one day rule the earth as we did in our glorious past."  You really believe that shit?
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
He'll kill you, Lenny.
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
All right... but do <u>not</u> go below decks.
So what?
The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!
Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
The resemblance is amazing.
People do amazing things when they're scared.
I could have given you the world.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
It couldn't be.
Will you do me a favor then?
Am I?
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
Where you been, anyway?
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
No.
Why don't we go together?
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
Don't come any closer.
What is it, Eddie?
I don't know.
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
Second drawer.
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
How does that make you feel?
Bollocks.
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
Foley?  That you?
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
Oh.
And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
Yeah.
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
And move to Long Island...
Yes?
Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.  Having fun yet?
Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
And your coat.
I don't know anything about it.
Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?
I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.
All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out.  I gotta go.
Shit.  When?
No shit!
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
Shells and lobsters and stuff?
You mustn't worry about your little charge. She is in safe hands.
I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
The car broke down.
Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?
Althea hasn't told you?
Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
Carbon dioxide?
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
How did I get in this taxi?!
You been smoking too much shit babe. Gotta control that. Takes a man down... I remember when you first come out to the bush, you was straight as a...
Does it matter?
Are you so certain you are away from it?
Is it loaded?
Right here.
Hello?
Are we going back to California daddy?
What?
Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.
For twelve francs, seventy-five.
Steam.
You did not like the speech?
To be my bride, of course.
A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
Glad it's okay.
What is it?
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
Are you hurting her?
Are there any special instructions?
I didn't lose it.  Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else.  Me.
Where we headed?
Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me.  Is there a place I can wash up?
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
It's as though there were two people in that room... both of them asleep... both of them dreaming.
Perhaps after this ... test?
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
Where's ganz?
Ahhhh...
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
Go to 'em, Jerry.
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
You were an Englishman then...
What want ye, girl child?
I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights.  We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country.  Are you?
That you, Talley?
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst.
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
An accident wasn't good enough...
Leave him alone.
Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
You know what happened.
What's wrong with it -- ?
I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
I'm a water-skier.
What do you want?
Cool.
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
Oh, who cares?
Victoria -
Yeah.
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild.
Oh my God!
I said, she's in great shape.
Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?
Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin.  They're right there in the back.
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too.
Excellent.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
Oh...ungghhhhh!
I'm sorry.
Gosh, you look nice.
Then what are you hiding?
How come? The army?
Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."
I haven't really thought about it.
What's the matter, Otis?
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
Do they, m'dear?
Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
Who are you?
Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain
Better keep moving....
Hey, peaches.
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
Missile!
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
Oh, it's you again.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
You eventually have to talk to him.
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
Did you talk to Corey?
What do you mean we.
Gets you where you live, huh?
Vince...
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
Who did?
Like one?
A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there? He can't drive.
Then we're all in on it?
Not interested.
That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im.
This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
Me?
You can't!
Tom, are you okay?
However they are, that's the deal. A buck a throw.  Five thousand dollars.  Split it half and half.
I already called for an ambulance.
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
I don't need any proof.
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
I feel weird asking him.
That wasn't very scary.
You-killed-him?
Ben!
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
Kinda.
Yes.  It's a present.
I don't understand --
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
Oh.
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
Please tell me.
I heard you were pumping gas -
What the hell you need her for?
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
For how long?  And why?
Not if you don't grow up...
Joseph Harbin...
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
So what do you want?
Something's not right.
I hate peas.
Is he cute? Ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail!
This conversation is finished.
That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day. Forget I called.
I like your hat.
Can it be repaired?
You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.
Mrs. Smith.
Gambling's not about money.
No.
Honey!
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
What pattern was that?
Where at?
No. What...?
Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?
Do you know what you're doing.
Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
She left the party early.  Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out.
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
Watch my back!
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.
Look, I'm sorry.
I carried that rifle in World War I.  This book is a 16th Century policy report for the King of Austria.  The diploma is my con- ference of degree in Latin from Trinity College.  Class of 1672.  It goes on.
Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
I'm glad things have worked out for you.
No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
I told them we invaded England.
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
... It's easy.  You go down.  You come up.  ... Right, Johana?
See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
The important thing is to find the right lawyer.  One who will not protract the thing indefinitely, in the courts.
You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
Back to the ship, huh?
The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did.  I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better.
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
What did they...
I am always receptive to suggestions.
Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
All right, Sonny.  All right.
Is it news to you?
He got a little jealous.
That was five years ago.
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
Yes?
My orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there.
You sound disappointed.
You want me to be the bastard.
Ben?
They took the leads?
They're fine.
We donÃ­t have to, Jim.  HeÃ­ll come after us.
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
They like Dr. Pepper.
I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
What's wrong?
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
Jean-I'm not-
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
Sure.  Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
How do we get out of this room ?
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
Why?
Let me out of her!  Right now!
Oh!
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
JosÃ©...
Want one?
Here, Jeff, I'll advance it for you.-- Fine introduction to the nation's capital!
The next one blows off your dick.
Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
In a hospital.
'Morning.
He was, like, a total babe
You want to see him too, right?
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Hello.
It...almost got you.
What about that girl?
Look at that:
That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.
Well this didn't.
Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."
What's the matter? What's happened?
I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.
A witch,  a witch,  burn her!
Brilliant, huh?  I already have a prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal.  Spread the news.  I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you?
I'll either be unconscious or I won't.  If not, I'll deal with it then.  I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious.
What?
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See?
So... bring up the reinforcements!
No, Miss Johnson...
I did that.
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
Helen, she sent along your things with a note, and John here, he wrote to the police.
Behind us?
Are you kidding?
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
She talk about the boys?
Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.
Yes.
There's a bathroom upstairs.
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
You mean it'll be difficult.
No, we're not.
Jane -- For God's sake...  Look, it's time for you to go to sleep.
What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!
I think you know what I mean.
You know, nobody likes you...
You haven't heard my offer.
How long has he been here...?
He's right.  It's unprofessional.
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
Because you'll never believe me.
That's easy to say from over here.
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
When did you two talk this over?
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.
Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?
And how rusty are these muskets?
Hey, he's not sore, is he?
I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
That's because you grew up rich.
I'm not Regan.
It's safe?
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't.  She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf!
So?
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
Describe him.
This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?
It's possible.
In 1957, we had an employee here, name of Fowler. He was very popular, too. Turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the Actuarial Department tying up the switchboard, figuring the odds on our I.B.M. machines -- so the day before the Kentucky Derby, I called in the Vice Squad and we raided the thirteenth floor.
Whatever happened to women in back?
Huh huh huh. That chick was talking about doing it.
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
I was getting worried.  Who was it?
Yes.
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
So can I come along?
I'm going to miss you.
Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?
No, they didn't say --
I'm embarrassed.
...this is your sweater, right?
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
Now, look...!
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
Who did you think?
Five times a day?
Damn that Charlie I
I don't know.
No.
I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
You call them if you want.
You cannot go alone.
My rates...
Too late now.
Looks like we'll have to send someone down -- a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.
That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up.  Huh, Mom?
Aye, sir.
As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
There's no God, there's no devil, I hate the God damn world!  I want To die!
Hi, Charlie.
It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
Action?
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
What?
Everyone regrets something.
I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
That film was a fake! Everything's phony...
That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
Really.  What'll I pin this on?
Sure, boss.
Oh, my!
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
What?
Yes... Get rid of him.
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
An informant.
I've continued working on the case!
I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off. I'm not sayin' they weren't there, I'm sayin' they were there. But they didn't move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman. That's how I know we were set up. You can see that, can't you, Mr. White?
I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.
-- it's getting older by the second. Mr. Price, if I could just please have --
Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
I missed...
What are you fighting for in here? The good of Rome?  I can end this madness now!  Take the job for the sake of the Gods, live!
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
Well, there's a problem.
Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
I still am.
What are we playing for?
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
Where is this broad?
What do you mean?
Why, why do you think that is?
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
This ties in with Nash.
And?
Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.
How's the IPO?
It took you long enough to get my ass out.
The timing was off -- I need this light.
I.don't get it.  You're going to help me?
Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
She's quite pretty.
I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
She left me. Crabs.
This is bad.
What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
Yes sir.
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
It's the President, for Christ's sake!
She won't give me any more cigarettes!
Sir, please lower your voice--
Jawohl!
Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery.
Don't you like that?
Oh!
Don't do that again!
So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
What did you say?
--cliff-hangers--
Do you ever perform out here? I'd love to see you.
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
I'm fine.
That's right.
See you later.
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
My arm!
What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you?
Yours.
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
I will find you. I will be with you.
What is it?
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
Visitors to the convent.
You're drunk.
How'd you know my name was Jack?
I'm not joking.  I had to face up to all my competitive drives, and believe me, I've got 'em.
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.
Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana --  -- want to see his picture?
Junior year!
I hope you get everything you want out of life --
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic?  So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the one"?
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
...takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education... and the right tailor.
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
I think you're fucking crazy!
Why'd you do it, Craig?
Like rotting meat.
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important?
Howls.
It's important.
Er ... Thanks ...
Sure.
Tomorrow?
Sometimes.
You don't know.
What is it?
Toby Oxman.
You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
I never thought you were.
Winning isn't everything.
Yes, sir, I am.
Another one?
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
Do they come in dreams, these visions?
Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
I could give you a dozen good reasons.
Now just a minute!
You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.
That's my opinion.
What do you want? You're tall.
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
Well...
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.
Not my girl anymore
Don't pay any attention to him. That's his way and I've found he's sure easy to get along with. I don't recollect him havin' hit me more'n a couple of times and I guess I had it comin'.
Did you send my folks in Philly the check...?
Mhravitch.
No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see the bank!]
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
Got any good ideas?
I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way.  Everything you do is magic.
No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope.
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
Bullshit!
What's on your mind?
It *is* not!
Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
Hunt with Vince?
The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it.
Live together.
What is she saying?
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
He --
Motherfucker works fast.
Yeah.
I must be destroyed.
Sweetheart, write down your former address.
King Tut's tomb....
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
... I've seen them, too.
Screening calls. Any suggestions?
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. ­- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.
He said his mouth.
What is it?
I don't understand. Living....selection is computed. You can't... What have you done to LUH?  She was here..
This is the one that looked at Dana.
I put her to sleep.
It's all we have.
Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?
Pleased to meet you.
I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs.
What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?
You look awful.
There ! There ! Did you see ! They're still alive !
All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay.
This knife is filthy.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
A meeting?
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
Jaime --
Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be okay?
Nothing.
Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't 'be-loved Aunt Winifred'.
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
Not much else.
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
Strange.
What'll it be?
What is this "you say"?  A deal kicks out...I got to eat.  Shit, Williamson, shit.  You...Moss... Roma...look at the sheets...look at the sheets.  Nineteen eighty, eighty-one...eighty-two...six months of eighty-two...who's there? Who's up there?
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
You wanted to see me?
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
What for?
It doesn't mean anything.
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
He hears...everything.
Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
I kissed her while she was laughing.
Susie, I like this new attitude of yours.  You're growing up and I like it!  I don't like it when you're limp and dependent, when you're odd and wayward.  This gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world.  Because, don't forget, dear, you won't always have me with you, will you...?
No...
Then why go to the bus station?
Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
Have you got your gun on now?
I don't believe it!
Is she saying this in Albanian...?
Dance with me.
Yes.
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
You live in Miami?
And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.
Of course.
When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
There's the rub.
Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
What time was that?
Mm.
And what are you going to do?
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!
Yes sir
Sure!
It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground.
Do you have something better to talk about ?
Stay up there, Girl...
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.
What the hell are you pissin' about, I'd like to know?
Shut them up!
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
Who's there?  Anyone there?
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
What did he say?
They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why?  Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.
No!  You said crossing the beams would be BAD.  It'll kill her!  And us!
Have I said something amiss?
I see.  She must have been very happy here.
I didn't know that.
Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
What did you say?
C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
No, no...
Way to go, Tracy!  Isn't this exciting?
Doesn't surprise me at all.
I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me.  But...
How do you mean?
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
There appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand.
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
Ready?
They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
Oh!
Right.
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
What a man!
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
His condition? What do you mean?
No kidding.
Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
I'll getcha a piece.
Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal...
I don't want to know.
So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right?
V'ger is that which programmed me.
...cause you said...
The great and <u>beautiful</u>...
I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...
Is he cute?
That's your decision.
I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.
Shit! What are we gonna do?
You're poisoning that child's mind.
Who is this.
Tommy...
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
Second district ... Explain better ...
I'm goin'. You on the list?
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
If I had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I'd be dead.
What way might that be?
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
Hey, you couldn't know.
... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
I won't.
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
Sera you are crazy.
Glasses?
Is that a fact?
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
What the hell do you care?
If you're trying to be funny, Homer...
No. Never.  You think that's what it is?
Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D.
Water doesn't burn...
I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries.
I'll be fine.
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
How's every little thing?
Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
I don't know. I was just curious.
It'll just be for a little while. He can be... he makes me laugh.
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
Why not?
A what?
What's he saying?
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
What course, Skipper?
I'm gonna get you out of here.
OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL HAVE YOUR BUTT!
The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank.
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
Few have survived it.
He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
Sit.  Play with me.
No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
I'll do it!
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
[Do you know who I am?]
It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way.
I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.
I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.
Louder.
What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!
Mountain View.  Eight units.
Thank you.
Where did you get this ring?
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
Hector thinks you like him.
You know where it is?
Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
Selina, are you okay?
Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little light-headed.
How do you know he's still not here?
Pardon me, m'sieu. Madame Colet would like to see you in the living room.
An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
Like learning Arabic?  You're gonna learn Arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here.
Yes--?
A l'achat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais Ã§a pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. C'est pas vraiment mon truc.  I don't know any Austrian, Xavier.
I didn't know you cared.
If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying.
Is he all right?  Is he all right?
Apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations. Balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on Creed's temple -- not much movement from Balboa, duck a left, a right, another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- I mean explodes. The Champ backs off.
Sparrin'?
A fucking wheelchair?
My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take?
We combine everything. You are my second in command.
Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.
This is out life, Alexander.  It's a hard life but it is how we have always lived.
That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
The room has a bug in it.
Yes.
Aren't you going to thank me?
We were talking about my schedule...
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.
We won't breathe a word.
Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
I was wondering.
Yeah, him.
I didn't. You gave me a look!
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
I'm twenty-two.
You seem fascinated by the stars.
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
Max, are we driving through plutonium?
Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.
Who the fuck's Pig?
They want more money. They are trying to make two days out of it?
Oh, I like that tone.
Do you think I must?
He was setting up franchises.  My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
Could be a lot of things.
Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
What about here?
What's this?
-- Eddie...
Miss?
Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
Thanks.
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
That black car?
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
My father didn't die in a fire?
--listen, I love this country, you think I want to bring it down?--I'm not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk--
Come, I'll take you home.
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
So let the council swear publicly.
Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
Want to tell me what went down here?
Dad!
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
You can't talk to me like...
I... What do you want?
Yes, Sir.
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
No way.
Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
I'm lost, boss.  What are we saying here?
Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels[3] will upset me.
Look, Mr. Jefferies. I'm not educated. I'm not even sophisticated. But I can tell you this -- when a man and a woman see each other, and like each other -- they should come together -- wham like two taxies on Broadway. Not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle.
The inheritance.
Quod nomen mihi est?
They celebrated the common person.
Where's the backpack?
Who said anything about "loser?" Where do you get this word "loser?"
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
Where've you been?
This is a whole different ball game, Erin. A much bigger deal.
What's an immigrant?
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.
...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
You want me to uninvite her?
He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
A long, long, long, long, while.
Well, what if?
Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
Yes, Harry.
You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
I should kill you right now for what you did to me!
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
Why don't I want to do this?
I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!
Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...
Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.
Both hands on your lap.
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
Like a Chihuahua?
Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
So start at the beginning...
Uh-huh.
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.
When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
Just giving credit where credit is due.
The FAA announcement.
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
Little ones.
Can't you see?
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
Ego te abslovo.
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better.
Sure -- certainly -- but what's that got to do with this?
I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you. This operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that I feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl, who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well.
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
We don't want to be any trouble.
Six men means six guns.
Hey, fuck you, man.
Twombley.
Did you jiggle the phone?
What's the matter with you?
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
He's with the hotel.  I called him.
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
They would?
Reach up!  Do it!
Let's get ahold a' her quick.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...
Did you warn her?
I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
Huh, that's good!
No.
What is it, Sergeant?
Look, man, did you--
Why is it called Hellgate?
You seem a little hostile today.
Come here. See if we can move it.
None at all?
That's right.
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?
If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me.
Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
Queen Cherlindrea?
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
Everyone out of the rigging NOW!
What theater was I at?
Cordon off the area. Something came through.
The new place? New.
I plan to. Soon.
Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!
I'm prepared to take the blame.
Yeah, thanks.
Wow your body's really hot.
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
Why don't we go to your room-
Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
Nice rack.  How old is --
He eats all right -- his throat ain't scarred.
It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
How'd it go?
You want to tell me about it?
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
Apartment 306.
Who?
...But that won't last.
No, I don't.
-- we're evacuating the building --
Polo.
Based on what my client would have earned over the next three years, including benefits and projected raises, and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome... We would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
You're making me feel guilty again.
You were enlightened?
I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild!
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
A situation?
Every little boy's fantasy.
Damn... damn... damn...
Listen, Callaghan.
...as long as you know it's not in your contract.
Ronnie. Please, baby...
I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
So, why did you bring this along?
Dr.  Long!
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
Neither can I.
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
I just wish you could have heard her.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room.
Hear she's retarded.
Well -- this would be goodnight.
Coffee?
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
Uh, that message...me?
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
This is what we've been waiting for.
Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom.
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
John, you can't help her now.
What?
Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
You did.  Didn't you?
Why, certainly, sir. My fiancÃ©e. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.
O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim  monument where Tybalt lies.
What's he doing here?
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
You're marrying again.
The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.
Next time it'll be my neck.
An even five I throw in the jacket.
Been a long time, huh...?
And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close.
Cut round him for now.
Sure. I can follow that.
What?
You can't talk underwater!
I don't know.
I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR.  Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
Christ you should o' collared him right there.
You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
-- We must do something...
Well?
Great.
Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean?
... Spock...
How do I know?  But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me.  Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  I dunno.
Mean you to seek him out below?
I don't hear this.
Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
Doing the <u>right</u> thing.  Knowing who you <u>are</u>, inside.  Not <u>caving</u> to peer pressure, or <u>lowering</u> yourself to that level, <u>steering</u> your <u>own</u> course...
That's right, sir.
They work off the O2 tank just like the slice pack.
You did.
What is this?
Jesus, that's beautiful.
Fine... That guy's great.
And who are you?
Count me out.
...what's he got against you?
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
Captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?
This one's history. Moving on...
Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
You remind me of me when I was...I guess I was never like you. So cute. So questioning.
Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun.
We're going to do this.
I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back.
Why not you?  I'm letting you go first.  Do it.
You told him about us?
Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
He's here.
When did you start smoking?
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested.
Don't look so freaked.
Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything.
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --
Eh? Have a drink.
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
He will not!
You ok?
Well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't.  I'll have to call her.
How long have you worked here?
Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?
So I've come to see it as a bonus, really, that we've been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings.
I can't...
This is the Space Cowboy.  I'm an intergalactic traveler from the Federation planet earth.
A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
You've always hated the animals.
Seriously.
Hiya, Ralph...
Walter...I can't believe it.
Um --
Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last.
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
Well... I might be going out to dinner.
Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
You look forward to this party all year.  What's with you today?
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
"He can't write his name or read a book.  To fool people is his only thought."
Gosh, you had me fooled.
I'll keep you in mind.
Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
Minimal.
You was eyeballin', Luke. You can't gitcha mind on them weeds if yer eyeballin'...
You're going to have a bachelor party?
Why would I do that?
Not from you.
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?
Cool.
What is your position ?
Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. You'll love my Grandma Rosa.
I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
For you.
You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.
No...
I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...
Oh.
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
None at all... We won.
You got your stuff?
Thank you.
Are you okay?
It bugs me.
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.

Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
We've secured the doors on both levels.
To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
It's very good.  I understand you won the Booker Prize.
A sawbuck!
TONY....TONY....
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.
Funny.  Shoulda seen some track bunnies by now.
Why do you watch?
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
Said he'd be home later.
It's Perry!
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
Well, what do you think?
... but a two-thirds majority ...
...How come do you reckon the coyotes ain't been at 'em?
That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.
Even so, because of our size -- I mean lack of it -- we'll still be cruising mighty fast. We'll be smashed to bits if there's any turbulence --
When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
Well, many reasons, actually...
What'd it say?
Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
Leave me alone, Jude.
Jason! Can't you see? He did this.
Don't look back, just get in the car.
Did you ever have a serious operation?
I insist that you have it.
It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...
You're Nick's mother?
What is it?
Oh.  Well, when, then?
Even I'm not that crazy.
It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
Nice work.
You said nobody would miss her.
You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
Master safety.
You're disturbed.
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
Later, Brenda.  Ah, Bert, could you spare a moment?
Immigration Officer?
Yes.
Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know?
It's a beautiful dress...
You'd be breaking the law.
I've always believed if done right, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience.
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
Do you let your child watch your movies?
How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox?  Just because they say so?  We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it.
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
I agree. Go thou and sin no more.
Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!
My stuff's all over her apartment.
Come on, man.  What else could it be?
Where are you going?
What the hell can I do?
I wrote that.
No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
It's very good.
Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
Hello, Dwight.
And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
They do what I tell 'em.
I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
I don't believe it.
Bullshit.
Nobody says you have to be like me.
And I was thinking this could be our last time.  Alone.  Together. You know?
What day is it today, Angie?
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
Good evening, sir.
It's not right.
It's a town...
It didn't.
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.
Well, congratulations.  Isn't that great, David?
But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I.
Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?
You getting serious on me now?
She's passed on, Kid.
Do I know you?
To a lot of psychiatric small talk --
Did these sticks make a whistling sound?
Don't look like nothing.
You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
No.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
Seat 74.
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
I thought you were an archer?
Really? Why?
Well ... yes ...
Bet you did.
Always.
-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!
Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
He ate a car?
"A high court judge has confirmed that Mr. Gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault since neither he nor Mr. Khan resisted arrest." -- I told you about English law.
Then I'll tell you a story - a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
And may I go to Mass?
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
Here, drink this.  Drink lots of water.  Hold on to this.  Take deep breaths. Nice and slow.  Would you like a lolly?
We're on our way.  Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go up against Master
Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --
No, no thanks. Hey, don't-
A Federation starship.
Paper or cloth?
There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.
Maybe! Is it impossible?
A Ford... We have a Ford.
No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.
Fuckin' asshole won't budge.
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
My brother blacksmiths!
How you doing?
Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe.
You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
No--yours, madame.
I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
I know what you mean.
I don't know. Please...
Was that Meredith?
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
What's your fuckin' worry? If it's not your time...? I could get nailed runnin' this red light and you all wouldn't get shit! Only me, right?
Did you?
Yes.
Oh man, that's the best.
That isn't true.
He had to come from somewhere.
Those are my breasts.
Your mother says you tattled on me, boy. She says you told her that I asked you where that money was hid.
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
Trust me.  It will be bad.
Margo, nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking Eve in...
Dr. Chilton.
I think we should say some words over the grave.
So.  You found him.
Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means "good luck" in Jewish.
Maybe it's just the light.
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Well!
Goddam you. Gimme that bag,
You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.
Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
It's an honor.
Is there a firing range around?
What's wrong?
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
Is something wrong with Jane?
If you enjoy it, you should do it.
Look--it just sort of "happened" ...
Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
Well...
I dunno.  Lie on the beach?
Your father was a schoolmaster?
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
Seven-ish
No thanks.
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
You got a chisel round here?
Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
No thanks, I don't smoke.
So?
That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
Ten bucks.
How do you know?
Tom, quit fucking around.
I never used to be like this, Kate.  I had it all figured out.  No doubts, no regrets.
Serves his ass right to get it.  Motherfucker brings that shit onboard.  I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.
What did I say?
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten.
All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me.  Guy, set up the perimeter. Tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back.
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
You're late.
Yes.  She's an adult, educational toy made in Sweden for children over fifty.
When?
Yeah, I'm sure.
I'm a lawyer.
Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly?
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail
Grotesque... monstrous...
I need you in Philadelphia.  I got a code 90, in a-high school.
No.
No problem.
Well, yes...
Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal pussy.  So, when are you done with those meetin's?
You have any idea what kind of position this--
Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ?
He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
It's gonna be fine.
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
First you got to sign a receipt.
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
Man, you got a bad attitude.
Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
I like that image.
I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
So who -- what -- are you?
I'm not here.
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom.
You're pushing this too hard. It's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?
Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.
Yo!
What!
I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.
What's the matter with you?
You go north, I'll go south.
So what now?
Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.
Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
You're evil.
Your father??
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
What do you want?
Look, we don't have time for this right now, we'll talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  You're not wearing that to the Thompsons' party. I don't care how hilarious you think it is...
Yeah, well... me neither...
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray?
I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago.
Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.
Oh!
Yes...
My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand.
I'm sure we could find a country and western station.
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
Will you please call the chair people?
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.
I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
You called the police?
Unn.
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.
Yes.
How long have I been on Gateway station?
He's not dead, Ronnie.  He's just a little understandab1y, <u>fatigued</u>.  Let's get him to some help...
Why?
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
This is a very special, very old CB 275...
Good morning!
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
-- which is --
Roll him over!
Dad?
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
Home?
Yah, but this TruCoat -
That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.
You can't kill me.  I died years ago.
Why do you want to teach me?
Hey, baby! Where are you?
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
What are they, please?
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen.
What?
I embellished.
Furnished?
Yeah.  So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain. And we keep the baksheesh.
I mind you said there was two.
I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean.
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.
Any questions?
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
...we're all gonna die in this...
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
So... that's it?
Looked like an interview to me.
To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...
No we're not.
Have you?
That could be anybody's.
Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
What?
Should I stay?
Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
Well, is she your girlfriend?
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
The most wonderful thing happened -
Ah, Jeanne... come here...!  This whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...
Tell me some bad news?
They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
That's me!
-- I'm on it --
Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
No, it's an old football injury.
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
This guy.
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
YAWP!
Uh uh.
Keep your mind off her.
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
And what if he really is a spy?
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding.  All we wanted to do is borrow some sugar.
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
Roy?
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
Your wife?
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
Are you the leader of tis group?
Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?  Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied. That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know.
You threatening me?
All right hold on!  Lemme think...  Shit, did you touch the car?
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
At PÃ¨re Mathieu's.
You don't know the Underhills?
What money?
Do you want the truth, Anya?
Get some sleep, Kid.
What a beautiful fish.
It's Bond!
Now, Lydia... Favor us about your ghosts.
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means?
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
-- I told you who did it and you're not listening to me.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
What?
What's happening?
Because you're an idiot.
Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...
Well why didn't you say so?
She fucked me.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
I can't see.
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
You mind your own bussines.
I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
And you believe that.
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That?
The white horse.  The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.
Frank!
What'd you say?
Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
You remember me?
No.
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
He's dead.
What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband?  Do you love that?
Look, maybe I can watch a PG movie... I'll just say I'm counting dirty words for Sunday School.
Keep still.
You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore.
Maybe he gave them an argument.
How are you doing?
Nah, I musta missed it.
Vermin...
That's ok.
Come on, what was it?
Why? Because you can do it alone?
Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
Louise?
Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
What's wrong?
Okay. I'll take two guys off.
Now what is up with <i>that</i>?
How are we going to do all this?
I'd better go.
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Like a bet?
It's your deal.
Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
That's right... .
Downstairs.
She understands.
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking.
What do you think?
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
And...what's the man doing?
Do you recognize my voice?
Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
Where have you been for a week?!
Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
Very few, if any.
What about it?
You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols!
I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?
What is she shooting?
You can see for yourself.
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
Oh, here's something. The city zoo is kicking off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if you'd be willing to appear at a benefit.
No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
You're living at home now. Is that right?
What happen?
You want something to drink?
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten?
I'm afraid it may storm.
Nah.  Maybe.
With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
Now what is up with that?
Did you buy some clothes?
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
You're really cramping my style here.
Did you call the police?
I read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fianc.
I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder.
Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea...
Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!
What'd you say to him?
Professor?
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!
Who?
Jimmy.
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
Paul's only twelve years old.
This one guy on death row, who I'll call Henry, told me about his last victim. Henry says how he's in the bedroom of a seven-year-old cutie named Adele. Her mother's in the living room watching TV. She's got the volume on so damn high he can hear David Letterman's jokes. Henry puts his hand over Adele's mouth and says, "If you scream, little girl, I'll kill your mother." And of course little Adele doesn't scream, doesn't cry, doesn't make a sound. Then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door.  Ten days later they find Adele's body. Or what's left of it.  You believe in fairy tales?
What for?
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
What did you do?
HARRY, can you hear me?
Stop that!
That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
Here we go again.
If I agree to this, I walk right now?
Yeah, you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad, huh?
Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
She's dead.
Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
Well, that's that, I guess.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
Yes, aren't you?
That kid is amazing.
He teach you to do it?
FIND the Rainbow Bridge?
Ever talk to him?
Don't move!
For a good reason.
I didn't ask for this.
That soulless monster gets no tears from me.
Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
Fuck you, Panes.
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
This is a mammal, not a fish.
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
Goodbye, Mary.
Pullin' ah pants down...
We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?
Think you can narrow it down for me.
I'm sure you have.
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
She... she fell over backwards.
Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
He's your cute thing.
--you believe in the President, you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal.
Hmmmph.
Good book, huh?
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
You got into Harvard Law?
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
Oh, tell the story.
Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.
Do what?
Hey.
Yes...
Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
Naw man, that's some serious shit.
You've programmed that from memory...?
I committed no war crimes.
Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.
I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?
What?
If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.
You got everything you need?
Then it's not your problem.
A wedding band??? What am I supposed to be able to do with this?
And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons.
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
George Zipp said that?
It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
They just let me have my own study-time, my own reading time in the library.
Bullshit.  John.  Bullshit.  April, September 1981.  It's me.  It isn't fucking Moss.  Due respect, he's an order taker, John.  He talks, he talks a good game, look at the board, and it's me, John, it's me...
You're distracting me. Go away.
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The "O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that?
When's your baby due?
A moth... How did you predict that?
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
They call me Swede.
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
Are any of them inhabited?
I don't want to. It's different.
Thank you.
That's right.
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
I was beginning to think you weren't going to show.  That can't be all of it.
A Complaint Follow-Up form.
It's all fixed!  Osgood is meeting us on the pier -
Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
No...I'm in some trouble...
What's it gonna cost?
The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
Damn.
Yeah.
No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
Your parents met her.
So I don't like tents, why--
It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again.
You're kidding.
I'm asking how much.
About me?  How sweet.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
You know how it is.  You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
Crypto-fascist? Who talks like this?!
No...
Well, I'm as human as the next man.
I'm going to run.
You ready?
Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six -  I run a couple of newspapers.  How about you?
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit.
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
Of course they were. How many?
No, I don't think that's very much fun. Let's play house instead.  You be the friend who comes to see me.  I'll show you my children.
Here you are.
You're telling me you feel guilty.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that?
Answer him dick!
Thanks for talking about me behind my back...useful in court.
A square?
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
Can't do it.
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
What would you girls like to do? Want to stick around here for a little or... or could I suggest another plan...?
Your government needs your help.
Almost four years.
George, can I see you for a second?
Nothing?
You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
Relax, kid. It's only me and my big mouth...
The Castle Anthrax?
Why?
What did you say?
Hello there, children!!
Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
Oh, geez.
No.  Well, yeah.  Maybe just a little.
And you went home unannounced, too?
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
... You're very perceptive.
What?
Hi there.
They go. John. They go.
What?
You have the right to an attorney.
The dishes?
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
He's happy, darlin ..
Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
See?  You're laughing again.  But That's what I want.  Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea Of heaven.  Need someone to share It with, though.
I cannot promise you that.
Lily.
Godfather!
Don't belong?
I thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over.
I yield.
It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
You were right. He found me.
Of course. Where else?
You're off to a late start.
All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
How did you come to Gateway?
Are you ready?
And did you lose her? Did she go?
I'm not interested at all.
For the first time in I don't know how long.  I wanted everything done right. Open and above board.  I told Father Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
I dunno, boy.
The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
...for Christmas...
A sauciere --
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
Beat it.
You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry...
You are right. But before I can get him back here, you will have to help me.
Who?
I'm just saying...
Hardly.
Everyone aboard young Bill?
In the flack jacket.  Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile.  'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.
Keep going...
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it?
So what?
No.
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
Who're you?
What?!
Like right after the ceremony.
So --
I ask for Justice.
How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
Thanks for handling this.
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
I see. What about the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense?
May I ask...?
I don't know--
The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
Can I talk?
Go for a walk in Central Park --
Maybe you should think about it.
What?!!
You didn't seem to mind offering to help me on Christmas day when you were unwrapping that Prada bag I gave you.
Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
Ow!
Coach hates me, doesn't she?
Where?
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
Cream rinse?
Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
Are you saying our order don't make sense?
Yes.  I did.  This morning.  What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means? Is that luck?  Is that some, some, some purloined leads?  That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's...
If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to die. Depend on it.
Really? Well, let it rip.
They'll run you out.
Did someone save me?
But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists?
It's you...Irena...my friend!
I don't know.
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
Would you like to?
Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
Do not let the waters touch you.
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
What do you mean?
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
Have you ever been with a male band?
It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
Where have you <u>been</u>?  What happened to your wallet?
What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
You're on fire!
Brilliant.
The door's the only way out!
Getting your attention, Paco.
...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
Peter left me yesterday.
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.
You're back!
What about the tape?
...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?
Listen Judge, Oakland's Panther International Headquarters. We shut the Pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters.
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
Come f'r my rockin' chai'...ole Mose.
Do whatever they tell you--
No.  Here.
Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?
It's a league record.
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Did she throw up?
I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?
Easy on that!
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
Are those your words?
What is he doing there?
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
Outta here?
Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face?
Well the other night at dinner...
Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.
I think about you. I mean, a lot.
It's amazing.
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
Data!
I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
Lemme get my coat.
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
What the hell are you laughing about?
What's going on down there?
Fix it up.  It'll make you feel better.
Good. So what do you think?
I'm sorry.  Would you please rephrase the question.
What the hell's going on!
No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
Hi.
D2-d4...  b1-c3... and c1-f4.  It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening.  David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years.
What was that?
I'm crucifying him.
Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype?
But he's interested!
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
I think you know, Frank.
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
How's it look?
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
There might be something at J. Walter Thompson.  But...  ...I don't think they're really serious.  The position's been open for two months and...  They may just be on a fishing expedition.  I'm sure you'll be much happier if you wait until after the first--
Go on, Adam ...  I'm not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either.
Do you think anyone will really come here?
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
Where's the Majority Leader?
Oh, just like the President.
Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
Guess I should'n'a done it.
You walked home.
Not today. I've got other plans.
Where's my day book?
One-hundred-thousand dollars.  A little more.
Oh, and guess who showed up.
That scum Joseph Reed... they're calling him the 'King of Pennsylvania'.  The man's a budding Cromwell.  He condemns rich Tories to death and then 'appropriates' their property for himself. Naturally, the pig hates me for every Tory I've saved.
Said as much myself, Doc.  Can't place him, though.  To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker.  Well, morning's half-over.  I'm off.
It's cool, but where's the water?
Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.
Please.
That's right.  When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.  I said to my family, "that was the man I saw in the truck."
He was a worker.  I danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?
This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.
Lamar --
And no one found the ring?
What's wrong?
Pike, I don't think you're up to this.
Hi Loretta.
I think they'll probably have booze there.
Ten minutes...
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
When he was seventeen.
I knew that after the fact.
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
There won't be any this week.
No Dude.
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
I can't go out.  Not like this.
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
Hi again, how's it going?
Where'd they go?
Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
Did he say what about?
Where?
No.
Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than flapjacks.
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
The Monroe?
No, I'm not. I need a job.
I do not seek forgiveness.
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
You get quick action, don't you?
Oliver's pet,  I'm sure it would be the first thing he'd grab if we ever had a fire.
When?
May I see your violin?
I'm sure you will.
I imagine it would, yes.  So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.
No fucking way.
I'll get him.
Yes.
It's just for a couple of months.
When you remember...
Promise me she'll have her home.
I'm a good mother!
The room key's in the car. On the seat.
I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.
Do I have a choice?
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
It's two weeks.
Now Penny, stop that!
My what?
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them?
Who's the best? Say it.
Alive?
No shit?
Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.
Dorota!
Oh, please.
Can I -- I mean -- do you mind -- if I wear this again. Professor Tripp?
Get in bed.
When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
Are you, General?
Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
Precisely.
Sorry, old man. Work.
All right, I'll give ya a break.  Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left.  Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this...  ...in the back and run it through right away.  We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.
She calls it, 'Tourist On The Loose.' Local government commissioned it. For the public beach....
Five hours.  We both just know.  Do you think I deserve to wear white?
Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
What are you doing?
My pleasure, sir.
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
And before that?
I just got released five minutes ago.
Great, Havana's great.  Lots of activity in Havana!  Anybody I know here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?
You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could <u>both</u> be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't <u>count</u>.
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
Good. I need everything else.
That... him?
It's Louis.
You try anything, it goes in...
Daddy...
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
Clear for pickup.
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
Look, I'm busy.
Yes. It's a very good show.
He wanted to see me again.
But then you never get to go in space.
And the grass?
I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
That's right.
Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
So, <u>we know</u>.  We know it went through a black hole.  We saw it.  Norman -- when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we?  It'd go in some report like some big discovery.  So in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole.  <u>But they didn't</u>.  The called it an Unknown Entry Event.
Why would you want me to kill you?
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
Yes, Mary Patrick?
Do not tell a lie, Richard ... The cornsilk cigarette Harold gave thee behind the store this morning.
Incomplete, I might add.
She'll get here.
Shit!
You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?
Oh, my God.  Is that true?
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
You bit my finger.
The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.
Time from my mark...
Sometimes she's terrific...
Why are you on to him?
I... I can't find my seatbelt.
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
And I bet I've kept that promise ...
What's going on, Logan?!
What is it?
I should at least have you, don't you think?
Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -
Is that so?
I got her arm.
...man!
Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.
The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
I understand from your neighbors that all [them] cats are making noise at night. Dr. Meirschultz has put in a complaint.
Mmm.
Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one!
So how's the cat food business?
Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole.
Every man to his taste, sir.
WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
What do you think?
Hello.  I think his nap's over.
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
You have a real philosophy of life.
Not a problem.
Timezit?
I need flesh and --
I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark.  People are afraid of what they can't see.  I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog.  The kiss of death. It's all the same.
The Mission Director.
He's planning a job.
It goes away ... It'll go away.
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts!
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
Is he not going?  I booked a flight.
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
Criminal.
We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
No.
Of course.
About Suzie?
No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
Get in line, bro.
They're going to kill us!
Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
Find her again.
In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all.
Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people --
I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
What are they?
Yah?
She's alright, isn't she?
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!
What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
But you can't give back to them, Will.
Crash ain't there.  He never gets back till four or five--
Women?
Huh?
You certainly traded up.  ...the trophy wife.  Nice lookin'.
What are you having?
Yes, hon?
Perfect! Perfect!
I'll find out, you know. Perhaps not today--perhaps not tomorrow. But in the end, I'll find out.
Rosebreen.
Got cash.
Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
Wasn't my idea.
Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
Not that I've seen.
Of course.
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
I don't hear him moving around anymore.
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
It's obvious what you have to do. Your way into the daughter's pants is through the mother, up the Suez canal...
Eight hundred, give or take.
Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
Yes.
No, sir.
I think you'll enjoy this table.
A week ago, I bought a rifle.
You were scared, weren't you?
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
Do you think they ever existed?
Okay?
You shouldn't have let her do that! If he ever --
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
This is not good.
Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ...
When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude.  If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!!
YOU do it!
Said he'd heard you were up in town. Wondered if I knew where you was staying. Wanted to look you up. Old time's sake.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
The drill is in the water; approaching the intake tunnel.
I was looking forward to seeing him.
Did you make any change in this room?
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
What about the wife?
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right?
Why don't you go back to where you came from?
Is, uh... Is he okay?
Hey man.
What?
Are you really a virgin?
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
Kirk here.
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.
Mother and son. You arranged this...?
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
Jack.
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
Who's Frieda?
Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. It was an accident, but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no?
I'll get your back.
About what?
Yeah. We went to Harvard together.
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...
Cherry-red Tears.
Visit those foreclosin' sonofaguns down at the Indianola Savings and Loan and slap that cash down on the barrelhead and buy back the family farm. Hell, you ain't no kind of man if you ain't got land.
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.
Why should I be afraid?
No.
Where's Christine?  The waitress.
I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time.
The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
Mom says to clean up the pool.
Must be the Spring.
When was the last time you talked to your son?
Why are you talking like that?
Oh.  You coming by tonight?
I think you're right.
What are you doing?
Stop!
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
...Where's the transponder?
Ready?
It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a small town.
- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
For me?  I'll have the same thing.
Relax. Make your mind a blank.
You can?
Easy, easy,  easy, Scotty. Easy. You're back with us.
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
Oh, that's fun.
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
We better have a drink first.
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
He got lucky.
What do you do with the jackets people leave here?
No.  You just looked as if you did.
See? The Princess is under there ...
Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
I know.
Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something.
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
What's "cynical"?
I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
Ooh. You're gonna give me goose bumps.
Is there a part for me?
Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room?
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.
Does Dwayne know about this?
There goes that fuckin' Barney right now, with his fuckin' "skiin' trip." We should'a kicked that dude's ass.
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
Okay, enough of this shit.
I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?
So why are you asking me?
Give it to me.
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
Uhhh.. ahahaha...
You don't have a computer in your cabin?
Are you ready to order?
...hey Chuckie, how's the woman- slayer?
I thought we'd have a few more days.
Don't make no difference no more.
Where is this cave he's talking about?
I see.
Bank?
Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now.
Excuse me -
You want the title shot?
I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
I know I shoulda come to your office. I was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...
Enjoying the tour so far?
Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?
Which way do you think Level Two is?
Get away from here.
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
We're getting a stretch limo.
She'll drop you.  When she's done with you, she'll drop you.
Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. FurtwÃ¤ngler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
It stands so still.
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
You take care, Dorie.
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
What can I do?
Yes?
Laura.
Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was wrong, wasn't he?
There might be something in there.
Saw him do it?
What's her problem?
It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.
So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
Just inner chambers...
Oh, no!
78.
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
Wait a minute --
Do I look gay to you? Relax.
Let's move it we got company!
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
Sanchez...?  Hey, who...
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
D'Artagnan, you will hunt down Aramis, Porthos and Athos, and bring me their heads, or I will have yours.  And as for you, Phillippe... Back to the prison you shall go, and into the mask you hate.
No.
Your help.
The hell you talking about? What train?
We can take it with us.
These are really cold, huh?
I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
But you're troubled... aren't you?
Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --
How'd you do it, old man?
"Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.
I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?
Go away! You've spoilt it.
I made you my speciality--scrambled eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page 75.
What's that?
Hello, there, Meadows![13]
No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.
I'm in mourning.
She's dancing with me.
If you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight?
You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
Martini!
Yes?
Alright.
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
I can't identify him ..
Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
If they can't see you, what's the point?
This is supposed to be years away.
Who?
This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...
That's it?  No number, or instructions?
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
... Reminds me of Jennifer.
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
I didn't ask George to invite you.
Nice voice.
I sold them to Jerry Graff.
Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.
Ah-hh, no.
It was just a voice.
When did you have a nightmare?
You can go...
He's kind of a miracle.
Tell him we gotta go.
Sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor. The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice.
Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.
What honey?
Safe journey.
You shouldn't have.
-- yeah, this is --
I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
We'll figure out something.
Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
Gross. What is it?
Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming.  We could have prepared something for you.

When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
What do you want to do with it?
It happens that I'm the law.
What do you mean?
-- you've been a tremendous help to me.
I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ...
Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --
Yeah?
Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.
Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
I just got this motorboat - it's an experimental model.
I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny.  I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me.  Some sight ... right?
But we heard him.
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
Why not?
This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did?  There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral?
Give me his name, I will mail him.
You're a U.S. Citizen?
We'll be praying for you.
One minute.  This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you.
When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
Amazing.
No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --
We drown.
Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
I thought we were going to take it easy until the Mission...
Yes, but...
You guys are from the British museum, right?
N'who might <u>you</u> be, when all's said and done?
At what?
Do you keep any drugs in your house?
Alex?
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
I'm telling you, they changed it!
You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.
Corridor A.
Are they polar bears, too?
Are you sure you won't have a drink?
How do you know, you don't even speak Latin?
These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
Yes.
I came here from a long distance to stay at the Grand Hotel. I want a room -- a big room -- like you would give General Director Preysing -- I'm as good as Mr. Preysing -- I can pay like Mr. Preysing -- would you give him a little room, way up in the corner with the hot water pipes going -- bang -- bang -- bang...
Only once, at Redstone.
Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion.
What did you tell the people?
Joel? It's Joel, right?
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
Over to the morgue and up the hill to the cemetery. Never thought I'd admit it, Claude, but you were right.
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
You hit me.
Never.
May we go home now, please?
I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..
Deck four, Captain; Officers' Quarters...!
What's wrong?
And a car.
The police are very busy.
Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.
Mama's gonna raise hell.
I like well what I see.  It pleases me.
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
Hello I'm Dr...
... dick?
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
You're dealing with a psychopath. He gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life...
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
What?
You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...
Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
What is it?
So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
Jesus.  She's got guns.
Take your time.  I don't care.
Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what?  Around ten thousand?
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?
Yeah?
Doesn't have a head, does he?
Is he?
No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
Okay, lady. Out.
What is it?
You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
Are you coming over tonight?
As for the author... shoot him.
Who?
A dead body?
Yes.
Krypton!
I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.
Girl's gotta make a living.
Afraid of the hospital?
Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
Why not?
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
They stop for nothing.
You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.
Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
Yes.
Okay Frank.
Hello, Barton.
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
I'll pass the word on, then.
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
You're kidding me.
Well, yes.
Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.
Oh, you need a shave. You mustn't go looking like that. There's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. Compliments of the house.
Is this a fuckin' joke?
Scooby?
Matter of fact I do.
Come home, Dean.
Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.
Three times, to be exact.
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  What do you think I'm doing?
Could I see your registration?
There's a phone here.
I am responsible for involving you in this. I will go.
Excuse me?
You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
What was she to you?
Did you hear that?  My God.  He says that Mbwun is real!
Almost four.
I know that.  You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."
Yes.
Aw, Johnny... .
I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
Hello?
Coulda been much worse.
HARRY.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
...scientists.
And that is?
Shush.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
It's probably picking up another baby monitor.
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
Well, okay.  There's this girl...
Since my little girl became a mom...
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
The commander is not here.
Tell me that!  Tell me that!
You all right?
When I was a child...
He says he wants it now.
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
How much?
She knows. Clever, very clever.  And unappreciated. But I'm going to take you away from all this.
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
I can't follow you.
Luke.
Travis?
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know --
St. Anne's?
So they took care of Leo.
You hear something?
Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.
He has children?
I'm no dummy.
Still looking.
Of what?
There's no witnesses...
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
He swore by it.  What?
... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here?
Don't let me fall!
My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had...  but nothing more -- I warn you.
What's her name?
Mother please! Oh please mother make it stop! It's burning, it's burning please mother!
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
How bad will it be?
Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
Nerves of steel.
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time.
-- and why we need you.
Nice, huh?
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
This is your doing?
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
How about you? Briefs or boxers?
Leon's not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leon's found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned I'd exceeded his expectations.
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
Time lines, y'know?  I remember things but not so -- right there -- y'know?
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
I won't allow it.
During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on.
My colors?
What?
I want to give you an Oscar.
Yo.
Political considerations?
Murder, honey.
How come?
I said, I ain't got you...
Mr. Levene...?
For how long?
The what?
Yes, Swana.
Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
Moving along quite well.
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
Is there a problem?
You don't believe me.
Mid-town mostly.
I lost it all.
Are you asking me if I'm gay for pay?
Is that right?
My lady friend has a personality disorder.
Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough.  I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age.  I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.
You know, you're a <u>writer</u>, that's your script.  You're a <u>director</u>...  But if you're the <u>producer</u> ... what did you do?  What did you do?  All you've got is the <u>credit</u>...  Some plaque on the wall...
Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.
Fuck him.
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
Which number do you want, George?
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
Finnegan, what the hell was that?
We have a baby?
I'll find something that won't kill them.
This way, Edith. Harold is out by the garage. He has a new car and he has been tuning it up. He's very mechanical.
It's a code or something.
Stop this. This isn't funny.
Is it loaded?
He did?
You told em? You told em it's me?
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power.
People actually used to pay you for this?
Karl.
Mr. Caiman, you're married.
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
First thing that comes to your mind?
So does Eddie.
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
He's my favorite.
It hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you're looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.
I'm busy, Floyd.
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
Right.
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Are you sure you saw something?
What? She asked about my father?
The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
You love her?
I should go.
Right now.
Fine.
Bye.
What blood?
What is this, World War Two...?
He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old. And your hips are as slim as hers.
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
...-fall.
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
We don't have one yet.  And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.
Also identical?
Would you like to come along?
Yeah?
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
He could see me.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
So, what do we do now?
You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis.
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
What?
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
Not interested.
I thought you were here because you want to go.
Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.
It's our job, Gloria.
IT'S OPEN!
I'm only trying to...
Yeah.
You have your intrigues.  I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine months, I am free.  How much time do you have?
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
Keep these. We're going too.
'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
Greg.
Yeah, I think so.
I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ...
Try to keep it to a minimum.
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.
They feel cheated.
A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
K-R-O-one.
Together.
Yes, I do.
I'm serious, Sam.
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense.
So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass.
Good.
Crow Horse, listen --
I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.
We should have asked for Cabin One... The one Mary was in.
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
No.
Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman.
They tricked you.
Excuse me ?
You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
Well, "Admiral," that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard.
Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.
You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
Okay.  So he was tall?
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.
Who?  Who?  Who?
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
What did they want to know?
Oh, it isn't like that.
We did not.
I am not.
Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!
Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
You got your vest?
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
Moses, Moses Seradungu.
Appreciate it.
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
... makes me...
JESSICA. Are you sure?
You be our guest, Jack.
Boyd...What have we done?
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter?
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
Female.
What do you mean, walked?
Hmm.  Pretty good.
But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
And when do I get out of here then?
He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
I didn't expect to see you again.
No... it's in shadow.
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
Go on, you're tired.
Lieutenant, I have a top secret clearance. The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than you.
So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh Captain Rob?
I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
Shut up!
Safe?
I've had some experience.
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
Excuse me?  "Throwers?"
I don't think of us that way - ever.
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Where will we go?
Yeah.
What now?
What?
Uh--Mr. President--you and I are about to be alone in here, sir. I'm not complaining for social reasons, but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this.  Mr. President--I call the chair's attention to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate Section Three. "If it shall be found that a quorum is not present, a majority of the Senators present--," and that begins to look like me--"may direct the Sergeant-at-arms to request, and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent Senators."  Mr. President--*I so direct*.
Well, he told me to collect cash.
-- and when my husband died I felt helpless. They disobeyed me -- things went from bad to worse. All my husband's dreams of good health, good sanitation, good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him.  Then, almost accidentally, I discovered the secret of how to deal with them. There was a girl with a baby -- again and again I begged her to boil the drinking water. She never would. Then I told her the god, Shango, would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it. She boiled the water from then on.
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
Where you going?
Are you serious?
You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us. You spend too much time up here.
Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
Rebecca, you jest the one I wanta see.
Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up...
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
No, sir! You'll flood the whole compartment...!
I'm sorry.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
He didn't call?
In many ways, that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain...
Yay!
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
Cannon or Gatling?
Hello.
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine.  I think if we can rework the power settings...
No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.
Who ?
Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.
And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others.  You know there's only one place to go now...
Why?
What happened?
What do ya want the others to get?
What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank?
I can get you a job.
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
Boy!
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
All right.  Let's get out of here.
I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was.
I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
So no funny stuff.  Okay?
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
You caught that, huh?
You've just done it -
Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
Like hell it does.
That is not me.
...keys for the track. You have to gas it up and save the receipts on that. His address. We have a business address too if you need that -- but hit him at his house first, see what this little bad boy is all about and shake him up -- give him a little doe-see-doe --
But I could be anybody.
I wish I could.
Thanks for the coffee.
Wow!  Cool!
I... sorry, Mister...
Dewey?
Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
No, there's a police car way back there.  See it, in the distance coming around the turn?  The van is blocking it now.
Where did you get that?
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
Not much.
Here you go, Professor.
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
My mother just called you? Well, how did she know?
Finally, some gratitude.
Think I'll take the juice?
You ever had to open it up like that before?
This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!
Your parents'd kill you.
Well, what are they?
Who told you this?
Go to hell.
Can I make sandwiches...?
He supports me.
Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
You hear that?
What are you pouring tonight?
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
Who grows more beautiful....
But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
When did this happen?
He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!
Don't be late.
Yes!
You don't use shit?
Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
How's the stock market?
I am as well as can be expected.
Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
What happened when he was 17?
No, see -
He's got taxi fare.
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
Ted?  They've set the court date. I just heard today...It's...  January sixth.
My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
White gangs...?  It doesn't track.
I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head.
-- And the new patients they bring me aren't usually as dexterous as you've been in evading us.  Not perfect specimens by any means, but not the type of person who'll be missed either.
Sure.
Yeah. I brought you some movies.
Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!
They're married all right. I just seen the license.
Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me?
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
Yah.
Don't chuck my clothes out!
Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
The list is long, but distinguished.
We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
Okay, start pedaling.
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
There.
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scare-I-when I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
Frederick Frankenstein?
So the method of death is the only connection?
You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?
I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
Listen -- I don't even know your name.
Yes.
They ort to. You're a good boy.
Like the old days, Dillon.
Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...
I missed you.
Two pots of coffee...
And I'm listening avidly, fellow.
It's a week.  We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -
Limos, huh?
Is that what you're looking for?
A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.
But it's not true, is it?
Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I?  Was I?
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
...are they hard to get?
Why?
You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.
Did Dignan take the test?
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
Something.  To pay them back.  Someone, someone should hurt them. Murray and Mitch.
Why what?
And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...
What was the bullet?
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
An individual more like you, you mean.
She looks after other people's children.
We both do.
Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!
And you defending her?
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--
Speck is dead.
This your current address?
Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the...
How long will you be?
Pheromones?
Miz Lampert, ma'am...
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
Things do change.
You can't tell this story.  He's not kidding you.  You can't tell this story.  <u>You</u> knew that.  The pay off was, you get to be Ambassador, or...
How did they threaten you?
J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
Oh, Rosie.
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
What happened?
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
Well, not much longer to go.
Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
Are you going to get your degree soon?
Gee... What makes you say that?
Does it now?
Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one-
I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show.  How did you convince him--was it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?
It is not.  Get out.
You know, Tom, I feel a little proud when people comment on your looks.  Maybe you should feel that way.
I ain't your "scout". And I am in no damn militia.
That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
<u>You jerks</u>!  That is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>!  You think I want to die like that?  Lydia.  Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.
You charge by the hour?
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
Childers.
You will wish you hadn't.
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
David?
Something I don't already know?
Yeah. She's only 13.
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. Could be a big help in unsolved cases. Most of them have been happy to talk to us. They have a compulsion to boast, these people... Do you spook easily, Starling?
You see, we're not so dissimilar.
The minute I read that script I said...
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
I wouldn't talk.
Sorry.
It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore.
What are you, crazy?
Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
...Pete.  Come on.
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.
Did you get a room?
Yeah?
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
We're looking for Mike.
Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
Obviously there was.
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
How's Mr. Parker doing?
Yes mam...
Shit Dude, I'm sorry--
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
Hunh.
Nice, huh?
What's wrong?
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home... yes, Dad I'm kidding.
Are you sure we should be doing this?
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
Wuddya mean, buddy?
I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
Saving them some paperwork.
A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
They're not after you, they're after me.
They were in the Army. Like your father.
Please let me go with you.
Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?
I think they help.
<u>Jake</u>...
And if you didn't believe me?
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.
Right.
It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.
Medium rare, please.
You bet the ponies?
Uhh... I with it sister but...
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
Who are you?
And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
I'll be right back.
This your present address?
Send him away.
Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
For a man in my position --
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
I really don't know.
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
Where is everybody?
Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low-key note in Kurt's handwriting and we'll slip it into Martha Dumptruck's lunch tray.
No, you're right.
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!
Hey, you didn't pay me!
Listen to me, Garry.  Please...
I wonder if his cabin is still available?
Brrr.  It's colder than New Hampshire in here.
They had an obstetrical nurse in there.  We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
General Ripper, can I ask another question?
Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
[Beat] Yeah, I'm fine.
I had to promise, capital P, never to take it off -- otherwise I'd give it to you.
What the Hell's going on?
What do you mean "why"?
No, I don't think so.
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
Who's that?
You're kidding me, right?
Just one more.  This one knocks off all the rest.
He was American?
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
All right, Riley.  What the hell happened?
Here.
Yes.
She was very pretty.
You gotta mind your manners, you actin' like a hillbilly tramp.
No.
With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
Hello?
Where did you learn all this stuff?
Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
This letter.  I've never opened it.
Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate.
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
Get a dance yet?
T-O-Y.  Toy.
The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
Aaach...Jane...  Let's take the part that has nothing to do with me.  Let's let me be your most trusted friend, the one that gets to say awful things to you.  You know?
It sure is good to be home....
No, it isn't that.
Let's go!
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
Maurice, even if it was true, what are you worried about?  Last time I checked, you weren't black.  I'm not sure what the hell you are.  But I know you aren't a black man.
Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on you und vee call it eefen.
If you think -
So...
She's there with you?  She's there with you?
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
What?
So what the fuck's a Finn?
I'm a dentist
There are Agency regulations about this.
I didn't see nothin'...
You have to say that. You're my student.
You ain't coming to work?
I want you to fix these fish!
The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
How about tomorrow?
Spanish passports?
What do you think of America?
She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
Mom--I mean, dad?
Now, what's this?
But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
You couldn't.
I thought they locked you in your room.
How can he embarrass you?
Not us, I hope.
Let's get the kid home.
What's wrong?
What are you talking about?
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
Whatta you mean she's not here?
Lebowski on the right?
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
Hello there. How's the flat. I cleaned...
Maybe she didn't come here.
I don't get it.
Who's gun is that?
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
Who is she?
Where up north?
Not a thing.
But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.
When served warm --
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all.  So what you dream?
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
His chest was hamburger --
Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
<u>Please</u>...
Satisfied with your cabin?
Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard.
Thank you. Thank you.
You can have one at Max's.
I didn't make it...
Uh huh.
Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!
I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a <u>little</u> about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.
What?
I thought you were going back to the apartment.
Is there a script?
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
Let's get out of here. We got another long drive ahead of us.  ...the fuck where I do not know, but I know it's gonna be long.
Fine.
Yes, goddammit!
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?
Goodbye and thanks.
She back in Kansas?
I'm hungry.  You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.
It's coming along.
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
Old woman?
Then what do we do?!
Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?
No, sir, I'm not involved with that. I'm doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago. Your name keeps coming up.
I mean, that's what I heard --
Stow away?
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Who is...'V'ger'...?
He was watching me.
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
You don't like punk rockers?
_Answer_ me.
You will tell me her name and we will go together.
If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him- boy, I was ready that night.
Thanks a lot.
You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders.  You two were a married couple.
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
You're hot!
Hi.
We're not after car thieves here.
What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
What's your drink, Dude?
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.
I love you.
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
There a maid in this hotel?
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
I... I was just leaving.
It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
Yes.
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
What's that?
Karl, you up?
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?
... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
"Every trail that you blaze/Makes me..."
Yeah?
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.
Hey, GI bill pays for school. And shit, if I stuck around here, instead of signing up, I'd probably be in jail, or sitting on the stoop drinking Bitter Dog with Rose, you know?
When'd he tell you?
He says you're not to see her or he'll chop her up!
If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.
If I were as sure as you, Mrs. Rand, we wouldn't be here.  I'll tell you quite bluntly: for the peace of the island and possibly for her own safety, we've come to ask you to send Mrs. Holland away to St. Thomas.
She got <u>paid</u>.
Here... now.
Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?
"You're still here?"
Is that Bee-Bee?
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
No!
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
...go on, go on...
Yeah, then what?
This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone.
A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
Whatever you say.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
Let's rest a minute.  I'm so thirsty.
Will ya look at her!
I heard it click.
Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?
Susie, whatever problems you have with J.J. - I didn't invent them! What're you blaming me for?  If you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off!
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
As a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes. I can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?
...miles.
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
You can go first.
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
I think you gotta hit them straight on!
Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson.
Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight?
I mean home.  India.
I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.
I called Mommy.
It was exciting.
A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
Wow.
What are you trying to say?
How do you know?
The government
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
You think you're so...but you're just...
Hello, Pinback, are you there?
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
Reggie -- open the door.
I hope it wasn't something I did.
Nothing, man.
Where are you?
Yeah, come on, play it.
I still feel...
I was just going to contact you, Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' - in fact, I just come from there.
Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation --
I'm sorry.
Cheery looking bunch.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
It's a mask.
I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
No... tell me.
What's wrong, Mother?
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
It's a brand new card.
Are you in trouble, son?!
You're not -- Dorothy.
Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us.
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
Where shall we put it? In the back?
I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
I'll find it.
What did she mean by going flooey?
I do about three-fifty, four.
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.
Yeah.
I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.
Playing hooky again?
What's so funny about that?
We had a good laugh, didn't we?
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
What are we going to say?
Government. Recently retired.
Step number two.
Tell me what's wrong.
I don't hear anything.
No doubt you've heard the rumors.
This... is my new home?
I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
Then what's stopping you?
I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
And what happened to Carl?
Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?
I wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into?
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
-- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!
You know about the United Nations?
Kind of.
Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?
Caesar, what are we going to do?
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming.
He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him.  She thought it was ghosts.  Let's go look for him again.
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
What is it?
The cook again?
I like that one.
Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
He looks like a terrific kid.
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
You left your keys in the ignition.
Yes, that is what I was thinking.
What's going on, colonel?
That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
A lot of people don't wear underwear.
You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do.
You know better than that.
Yeah.
This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?
Jesus Christ!
Would ya take off your glasses?
I don't know anything about that.
I hit him square.
So... here is the famous Jeanne... Savior of Orleans... terror of the English?  You look pretty ordinary to me...
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
A Chinese man discovered electricity.
Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?
Why don't you go and try some of that on?
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Gas?
That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?
Behold!
You didn't think I could just leave you?
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
He's dead, Bill.
I got the part on "T.J. Hooker".
Saavik to Grissom. Request computer study of soil samples for geological aging.
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
Do you know why I'm here?
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.
Killed?
John Ultramalensky, right?
Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish?
What can I say? He does weird things to me.
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to me like I'm a four year old: Did Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit for you or not?
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
Is she a doctor?
Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.
Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?
Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
Is my money in there?
Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
Don't be so humble.
I'm gonna kill you.
Had a close one.
I don't do that kind of thing.
That was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
Thank ye.
You think we should take that chance?
You can't-.
You did break in.
Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
Very much.
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
What is that?
You said 48 hours!
What's wrong?
The same thing.
What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
Oh, shit.  It's okay.  Okay.
Hello, Spooky.
That who?
It matters not, he is thy king!
Been trying to figure out your secret.
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
Let's go!  Fuck everything!  God damn sons of bitching mother humpers... I'm gonna rip'em all brand new assholes... !
You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either.
Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
But he's just a filthy criminal?
And I won't tell anyone who you are.
Schwartz.
What's wrong, Scully?
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
Hi. Want a drink?
So how does it happen?
I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play...
If you like -- just hurry!
I dunno, Must be a king.
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
Yeah?
But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
Re-runs?
Hm?
Oh, don't do it on my account--
You got salt last week.
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
I was havin' a drink with my future wife.
Try some other ways.
Why didn't you tell me about it?
What about... The money?
Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
Yes.
They're coming!
Where's your brother?
I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
I couldn't have... much longer.
Macy Struthers -- God I must have been blind -- still, the weaker the man, the dumber the blonde.
My what?
Yes, of course.
Fuck is up?!
I didn't say that.
Mm?
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
No.
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
You're a married man, am I right?
You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.
What's wrong with your leg, Daddy?
Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
I have on occasion disobeyed orders.
Is he next?  Do you drag him into your little room?  Where is it?  Is this it?
What a charming idea. May I see?
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...
Oh.
Look ! Look !
Who is to say our morals are better than hers?  But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know.
And what are you implying?
The speech? Real good.
Hi.  Are you calling from jail?
In a  Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, Rothstein followed several...
Why?!
Come again?
What are you babbling about?
No.
You mean a figurehead.
Mom's going to hate it.
I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!
You can.  You're full of ideas.  You just need to squeeze one out.
I look like a total wanker, don't I?
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth --
They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
Okay.
It's already two hours... What are we going to do?
How many points you got left on your license?
What night?
He'll be there at 8:30.
I think JosÃ© suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate.  And people, who are good at what they do?  They have egos, too...
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
She can never be cured?
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
How big a package we talking about?
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.
Big case?
Nope.
I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come?
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
I'm thirsty.
You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.
Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
Come on, you're prettier than that.
Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.
She was beautiful.
Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
Would it?
Wait.
Doesn't seem much doubt about it, does there?
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
Good afternoon.  I'm glad to see you up and around.
I'm a lawyer. The firm is thinking about renovating. Everything dates back to the Sixties.
Sir?
Merde!
It's not unthinkable.
God rest her soul.
But, Mrs. Rand --
That's too bad.
Do you know what this is, Data?
How'd you know they were--
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
To kill me?
Sure...He lives there?
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
What happened to Colonel Brynner?
I seen your fucking face.
Washington is perfect.  He's a Southerner, he's a war hero and he's rich!
They were taking you away.
What's wrong?
Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good.
House.
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
Okay.
Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
Put the fucking kettle down.
Damn him!  I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that.
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
It's a lot of money, Pam.
Fine as May wine.
Finger food...?
Like what... my favorite color... ?
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
Where is he now?
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
Hi.
Then why are you shaking?
Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?
That was a mistake.  The rain on my car is a baptism.  The new me.  Iceman, power Lloyd.  My assault on the world begins now. Believe in myself, answer to no one... You probably got it all figured out, Corey.  If you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise.
I forgot to thank you for breakfast.
What happened to them?
What are they?
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
What're you talking about?
Theo wants to talk again.
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
Joyce?
I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.
I don't want it reported!
I hear nothing.
Otis what?
Susan, I really think -
285.
Oh... What are you working on?
You don't have to do that.
If I can.
Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
Scams, con games.  How many?
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
...that is going to explode...
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
Who?
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard?
My orders are from Com-Sec Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon --
Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?
You've been listening in the whole time?
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
Where was the girl?
A Thermos of hot coffee. A blanket. Socks.
350 miles.
...You know that car?
Well, you know, you know, that's a lie, I, I...
What are you doing?
Thanks.
Well, do you?
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!
This is so bad, it's almost good.
I saw the flag signal--what's up?
I don't know... He's a little disgusting... Although some women go for that.
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.
Sexual assault, Daryl.  Five years.  But you got lucky, right?  You got away with something else.  Something you figured nobody knows about.
Where was it parked?
Is she fair, this princess?
I will run.
There's still ink on my fingers from last week.
Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
The zoo?
[Who's that?]
Huh, we don't seem to have her data.
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself?
No.
I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?
Oh-what a nice outfit!
Diabetes?
Well! Come on!
Jabba's palace.
Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
No -- no, Captain.
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
The place produces nothing.  I shouldn't say that - nothing it produces reaches the Army.  That's not all right.
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.
Jeremy...
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
We've met.
Dad...
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --
Leapin' Jesus!
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
"Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
Please! Will you just --

Thanks, Cooch.
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
That's correct.
What are you gonna do?
Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
Where's Kelly?
It's okay...It's okay baby. Cry for Mama. Cry for Mama.
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
She's pretty special.
-- and how you happen to be living here.
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
Benes... What the devil happened?
Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
It's over.  I talked to her this morning.
What about Redfoot?
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
The marriage!
Fuck in a second! This is... Look at you! You can't even pass!
Join the party, fellas.
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
How do you think.
I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state.
It's orange!
Is it fifteen minutes yet?
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
Those were my words, Bill.
This life?
The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
Hi, Frank.
Who won the fight?
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
... what?...
Who's this guy I always see her around?
What I need this for?
Where is he?! Where is he?!
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
Funny hours.
...I know.
And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
...but will that satisfy you?
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
Hello, Helen!
Can I get a word in edgewise?
Recognize these two characters?
Leave her out of this.
Okay.
Get lost.
I was thinking dinner on Friday with James and Meg at the Saint Mark.
You heard that, Sefton?
She's got other problems, of course...
Two years.
Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.
Yes.
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
Dad!
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
What's that, Sol?
I know.
What's wrong?
I found it at an outlet store.  I know it's a knock-off, but I think it'll look great on you...
...I... I know what you are.
Why?
What else did she tell you?
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
I knew his great-grandfather.
Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus fucking Christ!
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration -
Can we just talk this out?
...What?
Nothing.
Thanks for the message.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
We did...?
Where?
Love it.  Which way?
Yeah, boss?
And sound.
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
Watch out for Dick Low, he's a liar; he has his own world. There was a Junior Agent in Seattle, not unlike you, an Agent who fell under Dick's spell. He'd have done anything for Agent Low. Richard got this Agent to take a suspect to the crime scene, beat him up, force a confession -- all unauthorized, all illegal.  The Agent died that night, killed by the suspect. Richard Low got him killed. Worst of all, we had to hush it up, let the suspect go. The suspect was George Sheldon, the second man Richard killed.
Go tell your father we're eating.
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
They can't touch us at this height.
Were you eyebrow reading?
I think you need some help.
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
What's happening?
I'm just fine thanks, and how are you?  To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is-"  No, do you really?
Is you all little Adolfs?
And what do you want?
You've read The Fountainhead?
Cab One, radiation readings?
Well, what about the sex stuff?  What if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow.  Like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it.  Oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay.
Yeah ...
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...?
What are you talking about?
Recall any names?
Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that good anyway.
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
Just coming up to ring for you.
Thank you.  Now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from?
Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control.
Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
I'm not sure I understand.
What time have you, Gaston?
Everybody likes to be as good as their word.
It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
Hello?
Jesus Christ! What's that smell?
Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.
Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.
Do you know them.
And the second?
Allie-girl...And Louisa!  You're So lovely.  I'm at your feet, Darlin'.  Just at your feet.  Guess it's only right.  Ma always Said you were the prettiest.
Can I ask you something?
I think that we should spend some time apart.
I got dry cleaning.
The Carter boy. Tell me about him.
And another thing, where's that old mixer?
The man is unbelievable... I say, leave him in there.
Five years, I think.  Long time.
All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
Then be trained.
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
Wait a minute...
You don't understand.
It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!
Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
Keep going over these. I don't want anybody getting lost.
Letty, you should be in bed.
Who is it?
Dave...
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
Maybe this isn't a good idea.
Believe me, we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard.  Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.
Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
Do you know him?
I always meant to ask, what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?
What did you say?
As real as any memory in your head.
Sir?
Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her.
I hope everything is settled.
It's 1945. It's a different world now.
I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
Now how did you get hurt?
Look, that shit ain't mine.
I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.
Is that what you call it?
You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
A man? -- To Switzerland? -- That must have been nice -- for him.
I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
A lot that means.
Morning.  Did you sleep?
Yes?
Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
What?
You can talk to me.
What do you think bodyguards are for?
There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
How?
She likes this dress...
Is she... dead?
What!
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.
I saw you out there. You want him to call you back, need you.
Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody.
I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse.
What happened?
Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does.  Send in a rÃsumÃ, make an --
I'm late.
You mean after he lost your son.
We offer...
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?
You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
You can't protect me.
'N turned into a frog -
Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
Thanks, hon.
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...
And I could tell you some stories -
Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.
You always get what you want?
Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
White's a mindless thug.
You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.
Jesus...
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
It looks like a Renoir.
Pay no attention to me.
Ok.
He won.  He was a winner.  That bothers you.
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
Not gonna let me in?
Leave me alone.
Omniplex?
Oh my god! On TV!
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
What, aliens?
Where are the kids?
Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
Still makin' jokes?
Well, sure.
Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!
You don't need "Hi I've just come from the restaurant."
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to looking at pretty people.
Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
Yeah, I suppose getting whacked has got to be one of your best ways to die.  Particularly if you're not expecting it.  You don't know what hit you.
I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
I don't want to.
He's seen both of us now.
But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!
Pardon?
Want some?
How much are they paying you?
I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice.
I'll see you there.
We had a deal.
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
Let's say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you weren't a killer.
So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!  VEE TAKE YOUR MONEY!
Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
I don't?
But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I".
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
Oh, shut up, Rose. Shut your mouth and quit crying!
Lawford?
You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
Don't shoot, man, don't shoot!
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
See that...know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you?
Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.
Do you know how many times I've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my way to Pittsburgh.
You -- covered in my vomit.
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
Yes, it's great!
That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.
You're right, Joe.
I thought you were...
A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his "taste" - so to speak.
Oh, Christ!
I've gotta go in.
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
Yo!
It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank.
I don't think you understand.
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.
The fat man's scared. Scared of us, and scared without us. Same with Maranzano. We gotta get their minds back on each other. This fuckin' peace is killin' us.
They wouldn't be out in the daytime.
I'm fine.
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
I'm your blood.
Well, she was.
Soon. How about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?
For what?
Shhhh.  Tim, I'm right here below you.  Easy catch. One, two, three.  You count it yourself.  One, two, three - -
...Huh?
Lester?
Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?
It is on.
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
You getting a reading on them?
You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
No. No way!
That's what I think.
I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
Just checking.
Did she?
Sir?
Ten gees.
Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?
I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.
Did I wake you?
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
Is that him over there?
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started-
But we had it!  We were headed right for it!
You will.
Wow.    I'm bad news.
Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you get used to it?
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
Jezzie?
What, you're afraid?
Sometimes I think that's what you want.
Telling you what?
You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party.
How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
She moved out.
Whatta these guys want?
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
I'm not going with them.
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
We can't leave him!
Four.  Wow.  What a big boy.  I love you, Sean.
How are you feeling about work?
How did you know?
Hit him again.
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. I'm terribly sorry to disturb you but there's been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council.
Aren't you tired?
Cutting it out.
Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
How come you never talk?
They put up the least amount of struggle.
Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion.  But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.
What?
My brother's a priest, man.
Love me... keep me safe...
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets.
Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
Where'd y'all go?
And if I don't?
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
I didn't do that.
Yeah.
My husband's dead, isn't he?
Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?
What do you want, Jim?
Excuse me, what about the job?
I found you someone.
That's what the one who made me said.
No.
I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
What do you mean?
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
Not yet.
Your whores never showed up.
Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.
I didn't mean to...
What did she say?
John Doe.
Oh, yeah!
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
I'm hungry, Mom....
Fuck you! Fuck you!
The Colonel helped me work it out.
What'd you write?
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.
Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
Really, I don't want to.
Shit! Come on!
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
You do --
What?
You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart.
Hmmm.  He said you were going to have dinner?
He's your brother.
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
Are they any agent?
That's going to cost.
This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
Jack, sweetie, I'm only eating for two.
A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.
Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
He doesn't work that way.
Yes, ma'am.
You are, aren't you?
I hope I'm not interrupting.
What do you want to do now?
Julia!
I make my own luck.
You want me to burn my book?
We do favors for each other...
I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
You know what I'm gonna do.
I'm too old for this shit.
Right.
What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
No, my friend knows her.
Been complaning of hallucinations.
You weren't there. I saw it.
Yes, yes, Spock...
Come on, big fellow!
I'll drop the eighths.
Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.
Then, how --
It's been about a year and a half.
Alex, please.
We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
All right.  I'll second that.
Yes.
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore.
Why'd they want us?
You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...
Why not?
It's a novel.
Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.
It's for the school bazaar.
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
Right -- want another one?
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
I'm... I'm not the king...
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--
I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
You got something to say, JosÃ©, let's hear it.
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
Thirty seconds...
What's the matter? Are you sick?
What do you want?
No.
It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?
But really, you never know.
Is it you?
Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here?
Hi, Tommy. How are you?
Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.
No, I didn't,  Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
What about you?
You don't want to.
Well, you never know, do you?
It's vile.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
Why do you do this Lestat?
And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.
How old are you, son?
Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?
Jesus Christ.
Did you watch it yet?
Not much.
Enedina and Paco ...
There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
You flatter me.
She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers?!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?
What?
They were cut loose.
You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
I'm glad of it you was borned.  I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.
What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
The other guy.
Holy shit, I don't know.
Hello?  Is anybody there?
If we stayed, we could make a difference.
What the hell do you want?
Why?
Rolfe.
No.
Someone's been doing all these things.
Merle...! Jesus! Hey, how are you?
I did.
What a team.  See you at eight.
I could hang myself.
I have lava.
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
Mixed salad.
Hang in there, man.
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
Free?
One just doesn't... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
Yes.  Pollux bought one along with the original batch.  Obviously, he found a way to make more.
Best game in the world.
John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?
Shhh... Remember this is a privilege, so I don't want none of you goons fuckin' up. Kay?
I -- I'm not sure I understand--
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead.  Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
That's thoughtful.
Guess what the Machine did?
...Not at all.
I unnerstand.
Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --
There were more then.
What?
Then how come it ain't done yet?
Back it down, Johnny!
That will do, Herr Mozart!
Where does he sell it?
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
What's the idea, Anne?
Lots.
Clementine.
What?
I've found him too.
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
Surprise?
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
How bad?
Come on, go on...
How's that working out, by the way?
Why?
What?
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
FUCK!
That's what it is. Walk on out.
What?
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
Good.  Vito, you trust that Mook too much.  So does Pop.
No, they didn't.
I don't smoke.
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
No, really, mate?
I'm sorry...
You better heat up that miracle				* you were talking about.  We broke through on Number Six, and the Electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer...
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
You don't?
No, just so I can see ya, ya know. Don't have to turn my neck.
The money, the gear!
Someone you know?
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
I want to see--
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
An' you won't let nobody touch me?
Excuse us a minute?
Sera... what you don't understand is...
They were enemies.  We were at war.
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
I was like a different person tonight.
They are being evacuated.
The dogs?
Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself.
Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
Howdy, Rhonda.
And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--

Never mind. It doesn't matter... If I'm worth a damn, I'll pick the right direction. And if I'm not, well, I don't care. See what I mean?
None for me, then?
Do you know when you'll be back?
Our equipment has arrived.
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
Where were you?
Hello.
Okay.  Okay.
At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxation-a warm heart-and a loving nature.
Sure you did.
Sorry, gentlemen. I'm 'most finished on my shoppin' here.
Good. But Jeff...
I'm not responsible, Sam.
They'll be here.
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
Yeah. Thanks.
I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
Who?
There better be a guy with the
Damn!  Close the door! I'll be right back.
One day you will.
You men are all so dreadful!
You stay here a minute.
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
No, I don't think so.
It's just insurance.
Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
I don't know.  Maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all a hoax...  The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
I had a good time last night. I really did.
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
Yes.
Come on boys, break it up...
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
Dr. Argon, everything's starting to come apart here.  You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying, but elements are making my job impossible.
You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen.
Do you believe him?
When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.
Yeah, if you could send it care of...
Norman.
Hey, man.
That's right.  I do, don't I?
I didn't have much to do with it.
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
I am Joe.
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
Actually only one cell survived..
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
Why not?
Then I can pull this trigger, and it won't matter.
Out!
Nothing miraculous about it. Just an interchange of gases. The end product of five hundred million years of Evolution.
Five years. My son was born here.
Not for long, Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver.
Catherine says you don't like her.
'68.
What?
I called Trina.
<u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?
We rented a car.
You can't go.  You can't be anywhere near that place.
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
This I can see.
Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --
Where's the challenge in that?
We're waiting for the Jet Car.  Billy's bringing it.
There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.
Where?
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me.
Who are they?
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
Yes.
This food is excellent.
Curious, maybe.
No?
I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
God, Dana's going to kill you!
That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
Okay, Sal ... what do we do?
I thought so, I noticed your name when you were announced.  I'm Corsican too -- my name is Arena.
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
Do you have the suspect in custody?
I'll remember that. What do you do?
I didn't use you, Max.
You saved the ship.
Good, flatish land with reliable water, why? I don't have money. What are you about?
You taught him a lesson.
Well . . . parts, labor . . . let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
I didn't know... I --
Who's that?
It's just going to take a while.
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
You would take a pain Ã­n the arse full stop.
Having a good time, Vivian?
Gotcha.
That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.
Good evening. How are you feeling?
Yes.
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius.
Who set it up?  Eric?
You see Tran?
And while you're at it, get me a bed!
How can you be sure?
As long as it's not 'what's your sign?'
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
To freedom.
You look like you could still be in high school.
Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.
Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
I hope it's nothing serious.
So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.
Sell my soul?
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?
Yes, she did.
You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.
You will honor your promise to me!
Say--wait a minute!
Cook school -- that did it.
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.
How much homework is there?
-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --
Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
Yeah.
Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
Yes.
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
Ask a question, you get an answer!..
That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.
No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
Something like that.
No, that's alright.
Yes.
Don't use language like that at the dinner table.
ERRR-IIIC!
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
There's no disturbance.
Thought it was my week for that.
So what do you think of my father?
It's your best play, Nicky.
He'll regret this.
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
Fifty thousand dollars!
Yeah, maybe, a little.
With your permission, Mr. President, I'd like to remain my your side.
It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.
I run him off.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
I know, I was wrong.  But Morg, Look, we got to get out.
Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
What's the beef?  We're sitting pretty. We get room and board - we get paid every week - there's the palm trees and the flying fish -
No.
Oh, God... !
Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
Yes.
Check the scrawl.
You okay ?
Dr. MacFarlane --
It's just an undercoat.
Yeah, I live here.
In a corridor.
Importation value?  At twenty-two thousand a ki...
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
Why did they attack us?
It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor.
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
I told you. I like you.
Why? Why does everybody conk?
He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.
What?
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
