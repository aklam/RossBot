Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
That's why we have to be careful -- we don't want to involve anybody -- after all, Mr. Sheldrake is a married man --
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
Oh, shit.
It will be fine. You have another.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
Yes.
What about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the "Park" ? Wasn't that a computer glitch ?
I'd like to thank the academy...
Giron...!
I doubt it. How did you find out?
I will close.
It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it.
Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
If I told you it might not come true.
It's kind of you to see me.
See you at the wedding.
Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
But who would run the store?
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
It's too much machine for you.
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
So what is it?
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.
So have I.
What were you yelling about?
How do you know?
Fucking Zombie.
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
Grady.
We can't leave without you!
No.  He got tired of pretending.
Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
How do you feel?
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --
Have you ever been to Juvenille Hall?
I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide.
And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
But she said she wanted to go out with you?
Let us know as soon as you have anything.
First Nagasaki--now this.
Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
I've not heard a note out of you.
Why don't you just move out to Portchester?
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
He said he'd sponsor me.
You got that, shit face? Asina...
Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
You going back down to Florida after?
By five o'clock tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here.
No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
Just the size of my head -
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
No.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other.
Nuke!  You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball.  Ask Crash.
Who you are --
Can we rest soon?
Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
I'll call somebody.
I am ahead of you.
I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.
I want to say something first.
Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
His parents.
The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans.  No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.
Gee whiz--
What's that, Curly?
I didn't know you taught.
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something...
You mean, you're gonna --
Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
For bravery.
All right. But this better be good.
It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.
We'll find out soon enough.
Do you mind joining the Israelites?
I don't need a drug.
Mom, he just fixed our car.
And how long will you be away?
...There's a start for a meeting.
Well what?
No! What gave you that idea?
Besides that.
Where the hell are you going?
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
Suzanne Somers' tits.
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
I'm a woman, Martie...  We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today?
What does it look like?
Is that why you're here?  To blame...
I don't have to. I want to.
How is everybody?
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
Hi, hello, great.  This is Seduce and Destroy?
Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
Yes, I do, Will.
Tonight?
Where you going, boss?
I've seen pictures.
C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.
I want blood
Let's speed up the game plan... call all the living serials to ask if they've had contact with a Peter Kurten.  We could use some help on the phones...
So?
You think so, Frankie?
Who's the old geezer?
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
Would that include me?
So why am I still alive?
Larry brought me flowers last night.
Will I see you tonight?
God damn... Kid never had a chance...
Don't do it, please.
No, sir.
What's normal?
You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
Away from your crazy Mom.
Who's going? Us?
You saw wrong.
What?
Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
Yes. Shall we kill them?
Merle --
We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir.
Sure.
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...
Look, a lot of that stuff goes back a long way.  And it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you.
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
Where did you get this?
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
What happens next?
Where?
You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you.
There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
No. I'm all alone.
Someone get a doctor.
The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
Empire.
He did.
Thank you. When Debby...
We're taking a flight?
And why did you drop them?
You want me to stick around, I could --
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
You know I can't.
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear...
Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.
Where's Nguyen now?  What city?
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
Really.
What did you tell him?
You gotta be kidding?  He's a human chum line!
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics.  Thank you, Miss Schaefer.
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
No thanks.
Are you finished surfing?
... what... ?
Please -- please!
That was meant for me!
Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?
That's not my ring.
As a robbery.
I don't know --
Fascinated.
You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the <u>house</u>! <i></i> This is an <u>honor</u>. We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like <u>caviar</u>, man. You da <u>shits</u>!!
You here to write my life story?
Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
Let me go, leave me, let me go, it's ok, please.
It's one of a kind.
God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.
Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.
Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.
Right.  Call me Christy.
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
And, waiter--you see that moon?
The priest.
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
Avalanche season is coming.
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
Yes.
Really?
No.  That was a sword in a field.
What?
I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
I want them all.
I mean, he loves his job.
...Hello?
How could you call him?
Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33.
Who?
Louise?
What for?
Ripped off. By hand, my guess. Perimortal: victim was alive at the time, there's blood on his throat.
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
Hurry, Grandmama!
I don't have an Amana freezer.
Do you know where you're going?
Right here?
...This month's checks.
Bacon, see what we got.
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
You would have met in some shower eventually...
I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.
The boys at school don't think I am.
"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
I'm not the one who put this scar here.
I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
Oh, for Christ's sake!
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
...the Michelin commercial...
Pat does projects all over the world.
How's that possible?
If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
I think there are some things we should talk about.
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
I know.
Hello, there. Who are you?
My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's Gladstone.
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
You got a lotta nerve.
Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
I'm here for movies.
I'm too old for this shit.  Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?
Are you one of the players?
Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?
Well -- I -- I-
Is he going to be alright?
She loves me, Thomas!
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
Did you tell Sterling?
It all seemed to make sense until Box.
How the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the President of the United States?
Yes.
But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.
Mom?  You okay?
...we find the jacket.
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
What?
You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead.  Do it.
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
How're you doing?
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
Lamar, I found something.
Miss Channing, I can't tell you how glad I am that you arrived so late.
Sam, Tony, come in here.
Who the fuck is that?
Georgia on my mind wit'yo fine ass. You know you saved this black man.
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
David.
Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?
Yeah.
The day after tomorrow?
Now, did you remember that, or...
So you knew this young man before?
Uh-huh.
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
Look, I'm sorry about the face.
You can see so many here.
You don't sound like you're from here.
We finally graduated, big dude guy!
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
Davy.
Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before.
You gotta stop calling Los Angeles .. You're dragging L.A. around with you like an addiction.  Look at the shit you're putting yourself through? For what? For <u>nothing</u>, I know it, I been there. Remember me? Up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes?  If there's a body under the snow, <u>fuck</u> <u>it</u>. Let somebody else worry about it. You gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this ..
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
Tell the other person how you feel.
Sure you don't want to come with me?
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
Am I a suspect?
I'm in town for a short time.
You know where the chemicals are?
Jimmy, do you realize what you did? Man that's like death penalty shit -
Why?
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
I -- I --
I'm coming with you.
What night? What do you mean?
Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since <u>he's</u> the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
Are you going to keep him, sir?
They'd never let me go. And you'd end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.
Well there's no time like the present.  Good night.
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
She touches me down there with a cigarette.  Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good,  I won't be a baby any more.
Bullshit.
Good morning.
Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
Why would they be going there?
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
Uh-huh.
I can undress myself, thank you.
I was hoping we could talk.
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
What are you doing?
Would you like to stay for dinner?  There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I.
They can be saddled.
Cannon fuse.
The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
Beyond the stream.  I think I know.
Vermont?
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
Then... why are you here so often?
I was so afraid.
I didn't expect anyone.
Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
Your father?
We had feared we were the only ones...
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
How's that, buddy?
It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
It seems I've found a flaw, John  You.
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
Thanks.
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
We need to talk.
Originality is my speciality.
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
Otherwise, you're not ugly.
Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!
Said, a person's gotta make a living.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
What's inside?
Fine.
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
I want you to look at this.
...like macaroni and cheese...
Tell him to shut up --
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
I was calling yesterday.
Daddy was washing Rachel.  In the shower.  What did you think that was about?
You realize...
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
Please.
Th --
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip??
You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck with me!
Debi Rutlege.  Female.  Caucasian. Twenty four.  Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel.
By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch.
Your brother's here?
What's the difference?
Where do we come in?
I think we're making some of the locals jealous.
What are we doing down here?
Same thing from Fish And Game.
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
The terms will be mine.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
You're putting me in a difficult position.
Oh, my. We're too late.
Why didn't you tell me?
All right, we'll make it red.
I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay.  I think that was the first time.  Does that count?
Nobody else.
Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
What?
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
I don't have a choice.
Then what goes on in there?  What I mean is, what are you thinking about?
You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!
You mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand, five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records?
You got your room straightened out yet?
Who's Dil?
And tell Corrado, too, that I'm here... if he wants me. You can also tell him that my tiny little heart is beating like mad, and that at this moment, it's the only thing that interests me. Is that clear?
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
They wanted a girl.
I'm a bargain.
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
Maddy's party.
Suit yourself.
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
What's the matter, honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim?
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
If you have some, I'd...
How's Zander?
Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?  What's going on?  Who's upstairs?
That's right.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
Nothing.  Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
That's right.
I have to speak to my father.
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.
You've never said that before.
The power converter...
I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
Nothing for you to see.
The Graf Spee...
Ted, do you love him?
We had to.  They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate.  Besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway.  Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick.
Well, how did you like the class, David?
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
Not yet.
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
What did he do this time?
Give him a minute, Clair.
Is this what you call the "butler"?
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
What were the others?
Ummmmm, look, I...I...
... Drumlin said you're been down at Arecibo for the last year.
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
What do you do best?
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
You Okay, Alex?
Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.
Increase his heart rate.
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
You can stop it right now.
What do we have to do?
Mom?
Well, these things happen.  <u>Purpose</u> of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of <u>cigarettes</u> Mr. Barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary <u>requirements</u>...
And what do you want out of this?
If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
No......  She's dead THX........
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
Hi.
I'll page him.
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
<u>Ho</u>tel.
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
Carter?
A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
Those boys never did have good luck.
No.
How?
Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.
I know!
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
Cock-fuckers are gonna pay.
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
We can stop him.
Commander, I'm showing two Son'a ships on an intercept course.
I missed you too.
Don't be a rat, Harry.
It's in a case, on his desk.
You.
What about Kanita?
They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.
No. You like the way I do things.
Nifty.
I can explain it.  Attempted murder wasn't enough for him.  He wants to add kidnapping to the charges.
Would you care for a drink?
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier.
[Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...
Oh, don't be stupid.
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
He was going to--
Whoa.
Doing what?
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
Same time. What about you?
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
You won't.
No.
Yeah?
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
Robot huh?
But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-
What is that thing?
They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
You think you can do this, don't you?
Can you give me a drink, please?
As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more.
Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!
You ever try solitary confinement?
I think he's just passed out.
Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage.  Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?
He even played golf with the President.
Short shift?
I mean it fixed itself.
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
Colon cancer.
A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.
Meaning he'll need a plane.
What are you looking at?
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
I am Satan. I am your God, now.
What do you mean?
For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.
He's really very short on charm.
I want to hear you say it.
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
Are you finished?
How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
And what happens if I don't call you?
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
I call. What you got?
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
What's your cut?  How much?
Is that all you say?
A hot light bulb is burning inside of you.  I want to be warmed by it.
The Sistine Chapel?
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?
Come out come out wherever you are!
Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
Eh?
Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...
What difference does it make...?
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
Oh.
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
... Kids?
Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.
Did you try to kill...
Oh! Mr. Igor! -- I'm so glad you're here -- I don't know why I should be, but I was a little bit afraid.
This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
Take the men. I can finish alone.
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
How is he?
Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for?
Your classmates?
I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.  I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.
...Hello?
You're right.  That sounds crazy!
The weed.
Just meet with the boy once a week.
You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
She's fine.  Please--
I am Quaid.
You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two.
What?
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
My gift to you.
Are you breaking the contract?
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
Goodbye.
Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
Can you tell?
Suspect's words -
No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
You driving her?
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
...it's a Teaser!
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
Rocky, would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the Championship?
Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
What about this?
Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
Small space?
You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position.
No, Rachel...
Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
You see Max Cherry in the dress department. We're about to be handed half-a-million dollars -- Man, look at me when I'm talking to you! And you don't think nothing of him being there!
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
Oh, Kurt!
He's in there!
I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
Yes.
It's nice here. It's different.
Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things?
No, she died when I was twelve.
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
Skeptical about what?
First things first.
Now remember, Baxter -- this is going to be our little secret.
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
And where do we think we're going?
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
I think I've heard that before.
I don't believe it.
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
I don't remember.
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
Now don't go getting any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am.
What's this?
What do you want from me?
What the hell....
How about you give us what you have and leave.
...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe a burglar broke in, and you found--
Then you don't want me to go there.
How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
Your parents didn't have a <u>bigger</u> one?
My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
Wait a minute --
Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?!
You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.
Mr. Mintz?  I don't think so...building's closed pal.  You'll have to come back tomorrow.
<u>I</u> dunno.... Ambassador to <u>Togo</u>, somethin', <u>I</u> dunno... he...
Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know.  I don't think I better talk about this right now.
Whaddaya do, just use your hand?
Well...
What were you talking about?
And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?
Gee, I wouldn't appoint an old twerp like Horace Miller--Taylor or no Taylor!
Can we see it from the back yard?
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Camp site costs a dollar a week, but you can work it out, carrying garbage, keeping the camp clean--stuff like that.
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
Okay, Wilhelm, go home now. Go home and think about these past twelve years.
Where is your attacker?
Who?
Murderers?
Do you really think so?
Yeah.
Go!!!
...without caution...
Our pleasure, Big Dan.
Is that the best quality you have?
Yes?
It was a gift from a client.
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
Uh-huh.
Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.
I enjoy his company....
You must know Ian.
Your mother met her?  Can I talk to your mother?
Yes.
What are you doing?!
She'll have to know some time.
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
Do you really want this, Dick?
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Or have perfect table manners.
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
Yeah.
He's fine.
Go back to sleep, baby.
I'll be there by seven. I promise
Dunbar.
Where am I?
Can we agree that that is that?
Uh... dill, um, face...
Remember the first time we made love - and then ---
Cigarettes and beer rule! Huh huh.
Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
You're in a good mood today, George.
Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. Well-I don't quite know what to say . . .
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
Who?
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
You killed her!
I should have left you to fend for yourself.
She'll tell them everything...
Get out of here --
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.
Kings and sixes.
You remember Lindsay don't you?
I can't lose more than a hundred.
Who's doing this?
Lieutenant O'Neil.
But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own.
Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?
I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
But, I have no experience.
That's not enough.
With what?
I have a lighter!
How wonderful of you, to hold that information in your <u>busy</u> mind...
Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post.
Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out.
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
About an hour ago.
Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
Be my guest. What you got?
I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.
That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
You're fucking dead!
You black?
You going to wait here for me?
What are you talking about?
Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
I guess this is whAt men of war do -- eh?
Never mind.
I saw one.
Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
Mm. Hm.
I wasn't scared...
How?
Quite. And this is why I came to visit. Have you heard about this CITIZEN KANE picture?
Broke a 100. Got 92 to go. April 17. DEROS man. California this summer. Waves are good they tell me, surfin's gonna be good...
It doesn't.  They ask you.
We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes.
Sorry, didn't mean to --
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
So?
That's fine.  We've got some new things to teach them.
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. There's no way off this place.
Well, Alan, I think we're gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
Let me got! Where are you taking me?
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
Just let me go.
Is that a threat, Detective?
They're not paying me anything. They've already warned you twice; this is the last warning. Decide.
...The police report says he was shot three times but the coroner's report says quite clearly that Denzil Dowell was shot six times. And two of those shots were in his armpits. Brothers and Sisters you know why that is?  Because Denzil had his hands up!!
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
..."and I won't never tell about the money."
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
have no idea what ordinary people thought.
Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk about it. If your numbers are right, Stan says its pretty sweet. Stan Grossman.
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
Shut up a second...
We need gas.
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.
You can trust me completely.
Yep.
But I have a visitor.
Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know? I can come down and, and get you out.
Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
...I know. I went...
So am I.
Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
Exactly 15.5 seconds.
That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark.
Captain...?
Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
Very.
Five to three. You're early.
What d'you think of the singer?
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
Last two like this we had, you caught.
You look so different.
I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
No... he's not... not... there...
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
I'm fine.
I haven't seen you around here.
You are quite sure it's secure?
Television?
I've never been under the table before.
Musta got some primo bondsman.
Uh-huh.
Is that him?
My... My head.
Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
You suck.
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
I'm goin' on down to Kansas.
Mind your own business.
For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
Jeanne... what are you doing?
It's OK.
What about yesterday?
Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
I'll pay our going rate.  Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
You do. You're handsome and charming.
Okay, Jad, what's coming?
It doesn't stop, Nick.  I paid the bill, I gave 'em their money, but it all started again.  They won't leave me alone...
Yeah?
Well, not exactly.
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
What?
Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
... Hard?
We could really use some coffee --
No.
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
It's me.
One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
Remind me why.
For sure?
Well you know what I mean.
So where are you?
Okay, Ray...
That was... the first one.
Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
Hi, George.
So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?
This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.
Now run along, Daniel.
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
You can't. Do you know how many people I've brought into...the movement...?
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
But she watches... she listens.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
Yes.
How do you Eknow.
Railroad tickets.
Why not?
Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.
Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.
So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother?  Surely her father...
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
Why wouldn't she leave?
I'm coming.
Seal the cave?
Anything today?
As in...?
In for what?
Soldado.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
Anna, what are you trying to say...
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
Thank you.
Gray killed her.
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
Trip??
Heaven knows. A lot.
Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?
I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.
Uh-huh.
She does.
Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.
I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
We were trying to scare your mother.
What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.
She thought you were money.
Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
What'd you do, piss your pants?
Heh heh. We're in Washington!
Can you do it man?
Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
I understand.
Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.
I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
Ground defense.
You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
Come on, Dad. Come on!
What took you so long?
Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....
I'm thinking of a movie.
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
Thompson!
Immigration's gonna love you for that.
You guys having a go a me or what?
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
This isn't working out.
Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
What?
Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
Oh, oh!
What?
I can't go out.
Who is it?
Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.
CONTINUED
Where?
What?
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
May I pet the deer?
...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
What about Philip Swann?
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.
When I think you're ready.
Don't say that.
It's too politicized with you in there, anyway. They need to be able to stick their necks out.
Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.  And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  I have no friends left.  No job.  I can't live.  I have to live with people. This death business... I'm sorry!
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
Very much.
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
You talk to him?
...I thought you were dead. Going home?
Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
What's that you're playing with, boy?
A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
Anything but Japanese.
Yeah, but.
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
Maybe we should split it up now.
