The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
And I can say the same thing about my daughter! But she is suffering! Can you solve that problem!  I can't deal with this now, Liz! If you need a yes or no right now, then no -- don't do it! Not until I know Grace is all right. Now, please! Just do what you can. Okay?  Please.
Fine.
Hold him.  Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.
The combination is three-ten-forty-four.
Yes, I do, it's very good.
I'll miss you too, honey --
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
Time's up.  I'm off the case.
Mine's the Eleventh.
Well, anything coulda caused that.
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
He didn't have to tell...
Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
It's a spring day...
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
Hi.
Look, can't someone help me?
-- We can talk --
One of the Christian habits we <u>didn't</u> adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait.
Hey, Professor Tripp.
I'm playing to win.
Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
Do you?
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
Agent Novak.  I didn't get a chance to clear him.
Great ! You couldn't be a fan of Dolphins or some other less threatening animal.
Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
Don't go making it too simple, we're on the cutting edge here.
Ass!
Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine.  If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
Sir, yes, sir!
It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?
Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
You try anything, it goes in...
You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
All them miners last century. Hungry ghosts, killed off all the Indians. Up at the mine. Earth ran red with blood, think I'm fooling around here. White sky was on fire. Grown men cried like babies. I saw a flash, then darkness descended upon me. They put me in the joint. Took my eyes. I cursed them. White people can't seem to stay away from Indians . You gotta watch where ya put your fingers. Pussy pussy pussy, Indian pussy.
By reflection we can derive a deeper meaning from our experience in life. We gain greater understanding about ourselves that can lead to making better choices in our relationships, our careers, and our goals.
You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
Yes, I'm listening.
People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
Let's keep it to business, shall we?
Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito.
I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
Pull over, Everett - let's give that colored boy a lift.
This is mole.  It's good.
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
Men!  Are you up for it?
Well, I don't...
I must go. I'm in a hurry.
I'm out.
I'm gonna okay you ten and get you even, and that's it. Then you got to get out of here before the cops and the newspapers are all over you.
NASA.  Plus we have these really fun pizza study groups, and we go to-these all county meets. And, I mean, not that you need it, and without sounding too much like the Godfather, I think we could offer you a certain amount of protection", if you know what I mean. We all kind of stick together and watch out for each other.
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
Hello? Colonel?
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
Come on. Let's go dance.
But, mom!
Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
Oh. No thanks.
Because pasta should be eaten "Al Dente".  So the trinket will just have to wait a bit.
Why should I be?
We just...
You haven't eaten your lunch.
I believe we can get a lead from their anaemic blood.
I don't see --
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
It's a white powder that comes in a vial.
Any I.D.?
This is a great young out-of-work actress.
In three months! Papa.
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
A fellow investor.
Coming.
They just let me have my own study-time, my own reading time in the library.
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
Get out.
Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
What the hell does it mean?
It's still the full price.
Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.
I've got problems.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
If you ever want to make it to five, you're gonna listen to me real close. Jason Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous. A week ago, he assassinated two men in Berlin, one of whom was a highly-experienced field officer...
Do you have an explanation?
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
I'll just invite them both to my hotel suite and we'll have high tea. It's very chic.
Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.
My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
What's that?
You shot her twice?
Who are you?  What the fuck do you want?
What happened to Seymour?
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
Hey, you said you did a video?
I'm not -- hold on...
She's a beast.

A couple of weeks, I think.
I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you.
Let him stand free!
Want a lesson?
Don't get smart with me, son.
And the Romulans invade.
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
They ain't got captains?
W-what do you want?
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
...I made a detailed physical examination of the patient, Sir, yesterday evening, I...
You're too quick for me.
I found it.
Where did you learn all this stuff?
You're crazy!
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
You're pretty black to be growing up in Rossmore Park.
Is it for a child?
Go to lunch, George.
I can't taste nothing.
That woman --
Why?  Is he staying?
No! You're not talking now. You listen. You can send me away, Lillian, you can pretend I'm crazy and pretend I'm still your little girl who can't take care of herself, but one thing you can't pretend anymore. You can't pretend I love you because I don't. I can't. Not after what you've done to me. Because you see... I'm still me... I'm trying real hard all this time to be me... and you, 'little sister', you haven't been any help at all.  Okay, boys, I'm ready.
Run 'em over.
There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars, too many color TVs ...
Paved with what, then?
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
This is our money, Tom! . . . Now I think we should go.
Oh --

No, of COURSE I'm gonna make the movie!  I've already preÃ³sold Alabama and Oklahoma.  Those repressed Okies really go for that twisted pervert stuff.  So we'll just make it without that she-male.  We'll fictitionalize it.
It may be work but it's not honest work. Faith is the real work.
Don't bogart that 'trode.
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
We?
You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
Not for a moment.
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
Red Rum.
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
Not yet.
A flare?
Just the same.
But we went there.  We saw those kids.
No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
I ... Her letter came to me by the nurse.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
Antihistamine.  For bites.
I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.
About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
Anything.
No, you won't.
You're lying.
My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
Turbine rotor's shot.
No.
Russian.
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
Pacifica, California.
You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is an old woman.
Great.  Classic timing.  Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce?  I'll check my diary later.
The big one.
Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
You made me have an abortion.
Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there.
My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you.
What?
No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
All right, all right! It's your funeral, Anne Schuyler!
My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
What is our condition?
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
Really?
Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
Ray, come an--
Listen, he's nuts. I mean certifiable. But believe it or not, he once looked great in Levis. That's why my mother married him. But like all good things...  I know what you're thinking.
There's no catch. This is on the up and up. Of course all you have to do is just sign the article - by Anne Schuyler's Husband.
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
I can't Jack. How can I?
Hi, Thorn.
Why do you think she left you?
Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
The greasy pole.
... is to yourself. Don't make me hurt you again...
Sure. No problem.
She's all right.
Let me do it then.
No I'm not, I came to Prague looking for something - this could be it!
You mother...
I thought it was Taylor's case?
Yes?
So you're not a cop.
-I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
I wasn't gonna --
He'll take one.
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.
My Thomas is a little rusty.
The father!
You meant it.
He won't get mad, huh?
Oh, and guess who showed up.
Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?
There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you
Growing a beard...
Sam called me. From Tri-tech. He says you start working for them next week.
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
He's here somewhere.  Find him.  The sub's on it's way.  Go!  C'mon!
Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm in charge here.
A saint just like your own mother. She's up in heaven right now, her and Lunette, there ain't no doubt about it.
I do. I want to very badly.
And my army would have thrown your body into the Danube.
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.
No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
Hello, Miss Ukraine...
How do you know?
The Hipster!
Uh huh. And?
Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl.
When your husband get hit by the bus?
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
You're wound too tight, Mills.  Let it go.
No.
Yeah, right. That's Sammy. And he's probably got it there too.
I thought you were a dyke.
That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy.
Do I love you?
I don't mean her --
He loves in his own way. On his conditions. Because those are the only conditions he has ever known.
Hopefully, very soon.  I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM.
He didn't?
I've had time to get over it.
Yeah, he's getting there on his own.
Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
Gee whiz, Dad--
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
Two hours ago!
Was he in love?
Are you always sucha good judge of character?
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
Sure I do. On one condition.
Spock...!
You want a beer, Ang'?
Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
Tell them I'm not.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
You have someplace to be?
Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...
Don't say that.  You look...  You're not well.
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
All right.
Go ahead.
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
No. Me! Me!
What's that, honey?
Yeah.
Step into my office.
Oh, naw. Hi.
Not necessary?!  Mr. President, may I remind you that our country's heart and soul are at stake, and our children's minds are the battlefield! The bastard Canadians want to fight us because we won't tolerate their potty mouths. Well, if it is war they want... THEN WAR THEY SHALL HAVE!!!
Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
You left your wife?
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
Hmm? Oh, it's just something my mother used to...
Shh!
No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
Harry, what --
I want my lawyer!
What?
Are you still following me?
Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?
You coward!
A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.
He can't be far away.  Find him. Go!
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
We're from different worlds.
Don't touch me.  Tell me.  Just answer the question.  What do I spend?  What? How will we live?
Of Geneva.  Tell me, Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva. Do you wish to study medicine? Or mysticism?
Yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. It only works if you're on good terms.
No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it!
I want to talk to General Ripper.
Well, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.
Well, I got to see her.
Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.
Yes.
Father's so proud.
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
T-Bird?
So you felt it too!
We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair.  We must protect them, treat them with respect, <u>nur</u>ture them.
Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
Yes.
Well.
Amen.
Exactly what?
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive.  They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.
See?
But if we <u>haven't</u> caught it in a week, then we have to go into the freezers anyway.
I'm her husband.
You promise you'll write.
Really?  Is the food that bad?
Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
What about "climbing in?"
It's just my heart.
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
Get lost?
Surprise.  We're pregnant...  Yeah...that must've been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
You know me, I'm a night person.
Thank God, the police.
We know, Audrey.
And your point?
Well...?
Yeah? You know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble.
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
Well, what about this?
Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.
No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
Then what brings you back?
Go to bed.
Go to hell.
And replace them with new ones.
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
Oh...f-for a long time.  Ever since you first came to the club.
She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?
What did you say to them...?
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.
He's not home.
We're just "talking" about it.
There's no end to your accomplishments.
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
You could make their heads bleed, though.
What?
Rheya.
Yes, Mary?
Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
Why did she call me?
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
It's a heart attack.
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file.
Stay open.  Who knows?  Lightning could strike.
Why, that's from Time Magazine.
Oh I see. That again. Trevor? I realize it must be hard. But Christ how long does it take someone to move on?
The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
Okay, okay, just tell me what's the trouble.
Rene?
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
I'll never tell.
Well, anyway... Sorry.
I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.
Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
You better handle what's in this garbage can first.
What did he want?
Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
The milkmaids.
It's twins!!
A spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies...
When did you have it last?
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
Tell ya father he makes the best heros in Brooklyn.
Thank you, Mr. Graham.
What makes you so sure?
Now, find your power animal.
Yeah? When was the last time?
You're the first one he'll contact.
Listen to me! I'm a British secret service agent. And we have about two minutes before Harmsway kills both of us.
You don't love ME.
Yes, Mother.
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
You're a little angle, you are.
Yes. Goodbye.
They're new to us...
How long?
What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?
So I quit.
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
Did you see her undressed?
Oh, yeah?
Fine. How's your eye?
Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.
<i>Storm</i> music...Wagner...
I wish you'd tell me who.
Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico.
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
Well, give me two then, ma'am.
How do you mean?
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
--you're going to be on your own.
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
Dynamite?
Don't ask me.
--Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had.
Three.  And add some basil.
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
Great ass.
Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my "dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
Ok.
Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
Helen.
The only thing you can do.  You must end it.
That's not the country Luke fought for.
She looks in her purse...
What's she talking about?
Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
What are you and Mike going to do?
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
It's not your taste.
You mean that girl, don't you?
Aren't you late?
Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
Mary.
No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.
You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
Got any ideas, little brother?
You haven't said anything.
No, sir.
It's a comedy.
To Misery.
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello. _ 130.
You gave up baseball to be a bank teller? I can't latch on to that.
Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.
I didn't mean it.
I don't want to know --
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
I'm not everybody.
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
Have a nice day  sir
You know me.  I pick things up real fast.
Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
What?
And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--
Okay.
That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
Why would you do that?
She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.
Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'.
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
You're cold.
I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kid!
Really.
What? -- I...
I got an engraved -- literally -- invitation -- with my name --
Is it true that your mother resides in a mental institution?
Careful? Was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while I was still in ze womb?
Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway.
That's not enough.  Tell me.
When you read it we'll talk about it...
Let's have a toast.
It makes all the difference.					 *
It's me.
I can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when Looseleaf and I start flying in pacqualinincheewa root.  I can hear the Alice-sit-by- the-fires now: "We discovered it in the Amazon Rain Forest.  Now we cure you with it.  Now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks."
You seen this girl? Say... within the last 24 hours.
Two hundred dollars, please.
I don't know.
I'm going to blow the generator when you get back.  He'll have to come for us -- or freeze.
A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
Nick Tatopoulos.
Right.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
I don't know.  It just woke me up.
Who is Jesus?
I...uh...check.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
Done?
In Dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any American can imagine.  Every Englishman knows his place.  And if you forget, there's always someone to remind you.  My family had no doubts about who they were.  But I was an aberration in that household a freak of nature.  I had imagination, cleverness, joy.  Where did I get that?  Certainly not from them.
I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about your choice of targets.
Me?
What do you want me to say? That I'm not attracted to him?
I saw a monster. Can I have a glass of water?
Yeah, nine years straight.
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
How fortunate.
It's very expensive.
Chloe's dead.
Wally Brown.
Well we didn't kill him, he died on his own.
Yeah, I'm here, I'm off the elevator, walking down the hall, now --
All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything I'm a part of.
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
Oh, I'll "get it." I'll "get it" all right. I might even take seconds.
Why, yes, of course ... But for the moment, let's be satisfied with Algiers! In the mountains our work is always easier.
No. She's probably scared to death.
Well, you can't always get what you want.
Let's work on it.
And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face.
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
Oh my God, mother!
I had you covered.  From back there.
Wouldn't it be better if you put her in... someplace...
Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rouÃ¨!
-- Tuscarora --
You've got to be--
Please.
Just a minute.
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
What a surprise...
Sudden flashes of light.
I thought you said the line was busy?
Three million?
I'm calling the ambulance.
How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
Yes.
I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen.
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
Fun.
Yes, sir.  I know.
Really?
Oh, you've been watching television.
Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
Christopher Marlowe at your service.
What desert?
Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes?
We know why John was tagged.
Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you everything.  If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
Porthos told me.
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
Chili and me.
And you know, he really does not.
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
Did you straighten her out?
You knew him well?
It didn't work?
I told you. We met yesterday.
What?
I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.
It's important.
If this don't beat all!  Well, I see you been busy already!
Where did you get -- ?
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
He always look so
Good.
When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?
Who am I?
Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
Confused, huh?  About what?
The enemy is matching velocity.
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
Someone needs to grow up.  I won't take it, Jack.
Fine, Joe.
You did that?
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
Sorry.  This isn't your day.
That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.
Fairbanks is a three-hour flight. I'll be back by dinnertime.
Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.
Yeah, well, couldn't I take a look now?
Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
Give me a mirror...
So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?
Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?
How special?
You're all making me blush...
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
Where has it been for the last seven years?
Yeah.
Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
Hyperdrive.
So he killed himself.
I don't think so, Brad.  We've just had word that the President is out of danger.  It seems I didn't kill him after all.
Forget it, I can't explain it...
You are forgiven. Goodbye.
I'm not saying it's your fault.
Oh, Jesus.
Damned if I know.
Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
Yeah.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
Telegrams?
Is he alive?
Lose?--I won a little--
I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
"The Blood Tide".
If you don't mind.
God, you look like crap, George.
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.
Thanks for your time.
Just get back here!
No, he called late last night.
Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
My husband will be back quite late.
Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
I am at your disposal, Your Majesty.
Virginia?!
May I ask...?
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
I'm all ears.
You have nine points left on your license..
To run late!
We're heading into a difficult situation.
Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is going on here?
You're still late.
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
No doubt.
That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.
But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
Nix has got to have a weak spot. Everybody's got a fucking weak spot.
Well I can't.
How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
Let's get a hot dog.
You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
I can't believe you made it!
Just like that?  These people ruined your life, bro.
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
Thanks for the consultation....
But you must.  It's the only way.
Everybody hates the messenger.
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
Leave her alone, Chip.  I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight...
She'll think it's her fault for keeping me.
Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel -- I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and --
Do me another favor?
No, I'm serious.
No.  It's okay.
I got him.
Give me that again!
December seventh, forty-one.
I will appreciate that.
We'll take it slow until we get to the main road.  Are you ready?
I wouldn't worry about it.
I was grounded for two fucking months because of you!
No.  Thank you.
We've gone insane.
And, America?
Help me send this Wintermute motherfucker straight down into it.
That's not the point.
It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
It's hers, you schmuck.  Look, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is... we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think about this a second.
All the more reason.
Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
We? You mean you're --?
Dead, I'm afraid.
I didn't use my name.
Sorry.
You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.
But Bob isn't real.
I can run out and get it.
Big as a house.
Is that all?
...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
Fools!
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
But -- why?
You're a hell of a flyer.  You can be my wingman any time.
Pretty sure I do.  Yeah, here we go --
Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
Yeah?  Who is this?
Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll just sit around all day long being frivolous -- how about that?
I'm talking about West! We had him, Bill, we were there. You're the fucking Base Commander, you knew what he did to Cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has --
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
Sorry...
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
--Because he has been so furiously busy wasting himself. Amusing his keepers. Because he is a sycophant! Because he has been thrown out of every studio in Hollywood and no one will hire him because he's a drunk- -!
That's preposterous --
It's, uh, you never know--
No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
A headache?
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.
Eh?
Tell her I'm almost home.
This gonna take long?
That settles it! I will not be attacked and belittled by my own children in my own home! My nerves are strained to the breaking point!
Must be your lucky day then. I've got your accounts - you don't owe much tax for last year.
I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
I believe in miracles now.
Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit.
No one. I didn't have the number.
I'm gonna take her home first.
Great, great. I hope you make it.
I'm afraid I am gonna fall!
So, it's obvious, huh?
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
Take your shirt off.
No...!
"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
Right.
-- and wanted to go on loving you." And I said, "I won't lose you."  But I did.
As an idea.
Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends.
What...  Some kind of organ factory... Pregnant girls doped up. Babies. There's a lot of people back there. They're holding a seminar. Trafficking's the past, breeding the future...
I'm sorry.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity!
Have you pulled yourself together?
What's a chickie-run?
You coulda told me what you were doing.
Are you going to stiff me?
Well she sure isn't normal.
Then go ahead, pull the trigger.
Doesn't sounds like him.
You're the doctor.
What's the point?  Look at me.
Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.
Seven.  Really.
What?
Just waiting for you, tubs.
Baby, you're scaring me.
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
It's gone now.
He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.  I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr. Leeds.
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
Sure.
No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  One kicked out, one I closed...
Go on, I'll be fine!
I saw him...
I just went there for a job.
It's been listening to us.  It's got no eyes.  It sure as hell can't smell anything underground, so I figure...
You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all.
Working, thank you.
Are you happy, Zaltar?
Oh. Goodness.
You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.
Oh.
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
Yes.
No. Don't stop.
Yeah, how's that?
He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
Now, Lily--
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
A .45--
Jesus Christ.
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.
How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
Just kidding. Are you alone?
Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
Ruiz isn't here.
She's a smart girl, Eddie.
It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
Who?
I got some money I can give you -
How do you know?
I'll come back all the time.
There's no touching.
What rate?
What do you think -- I should be carrying a torch for you?
No.
She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.
What did she do to me?
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
I brought it with me from 1982. It's from my science book.
That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
Hey -- Comrade! Over here! This is Harry Shapiro -- the Volga Boatman of Barrack four!
John.  Listen.  I want to talk to you. Permit me to do this a second.  I'm older than you.  A man acquires a reputation.  On the street.  What he does when he's up, what he does otherwise...I said "ten," you said "no." You said "twenty." I said "fine," I'm not going to fuck with you, how can I beat that, you tell me?...Okay.  Okay.  We'll...Okay. Fine.  We'll...Alright, twenty percent, and fifty bucks a lead. That's fine.  For now.  That's fine. A month or two we'll talk.  A month from now.  Next month.  After the thirtieth.  We'll talk.
Don't you threaten me!
Oh, oh!
Oh, no, really, I --
She allegedly humped him to death?
That was easy.
Especially this last year.
"Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
It is kind of rough.
It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.
They're talking to themselves.
We walk.
I can only write on a manual.
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
I'm the best.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
If you free me, you'll be a rich man ...
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
Correct.
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.
I didn't run away.
I don't think so.
Sure.  We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.
Nobody. It just came to me.
Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman -  ... so I volunteered.
Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
It is not an effort. You are my son.  Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.
Gimme another hint.
A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese.
What?
Let's just leave it there for now.
Je n'ai jamais vu tant de sÃ©renitÃ©. Elle m'a demandÃ© de tes nouvelles et si nous Ã©tions heureux.
Right.
It's time for tea, Grandma.
Not that.  Anything else.
That thing.  Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.
Jesus, Teddy.
It is?
What is the point?
Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
A sweet man.
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
What am I doing?
He'll have you -- and Tom.
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
What's a jizz-mopper?
My office.
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
Yes.
Wait a minute -  I've got it. There! Off the port bow!
Like I said, dazzling.
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
I promise. Is that all?
I'm so tired...
Not a prayer.
No. This is he.
He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
What?
Oh yes. That's fine.
It's not ignorant.
Sorry, friend. No day trips to Hell. Here you are. Here you stay. And forward the only way to go.
Why?
If I didn't know where she was, could I take you to her? Get your hat and coat. We haven't much time.
That's what you said?
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
No!
What?
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
And if you're wrong.
I told you - it's a sure thing.
...So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot. I mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays.
No one ever tells you that...
Yes.
I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY
The thing's kind of heavy.
It's a wonderful piece.  Emotional. I love it.
I don't know what you're talking about.
What did you do, Connor?
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
No.  She told me "right now."
Get a rope!
Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
I have a radio fix...
What's the B-G's?
So we keep an eye on her.  Raoul can totally administrate that part.
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
Well, I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back.  So, tell me, fellow war-monger...do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform?
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS CAR!!
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems.
I don't hear it.
So what?  This victim...
No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
Dr. Pamela Isley.
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
Then -- those are not your own words?
Sure thing.
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
Don't be long, Ellen.
You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
Fine.
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
okay, all right.
No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
My pills...
Better idea...
In other words, our scope is too narrow.
Rizzo did.
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
I'll be alone.
That Richard.
To explode, of course.
If she paid you well?
Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
Any time fat boy!
Yeah.
Underwear?
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
What else did the District Attorney's Office tell you to say?
How's Amos, Ma?
We got faith in you, Nick Mason.  You're our inside man.
What?
Right.  Oh, and here.
How about you?
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
...that's right...
Nice to see you.
What?
Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
How come ... ?
And what else is bothering you?
Can I see your I.D.?
I'm drowning! Help!
Nobody is even gonna look at the game.
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
... Best shot...?
Sent it where?
Pecos Bill.
I don't know...
There's a name on the gravestone.
But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --
What's to stop you? Saunders will help you with it--
No you won't.
Lemme down, bugface!
I've got you floored... We're off ... Take the curb... Man, can you corner... Know not to get on it ... Momentum shift ... Don't get on those brakes too hard ... Get her up on her tires. Up on her toes. Up ... Up... Up.
No. I --
Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
What is it?
How does the distress signal look?
[I told you, non-negotiable.]
I hate to bother you when you're laid up.
And you should be with your family.
Any of them Richard Long?
Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.
I'm fine.
We should talk.
On Norville Barnes!
Fuck you.
Watch Clark.
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
In fact, we never knew she had any friends period.
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Yes.
Yeah, yeah.
You got it, cowboy.
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
How was your trip to Mars?
You haven't heard me.
I just have to get something. I'll be right back.
So am I.
Sure.  Bases Loaded.
She works at a church?
OK, open the gate.
You wouldn't.
Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?
So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
He was wearing a suit.
I can think of another word.
Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  Do you want to tell him that?
It's got nothing to do with inflation. Rates, for example, rise independently of tight money if you look at interest curves carefully. Historically, that's always been true, though most people don't realize it.
Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
I need to get in the trunk.
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready.  He's still too much of a kid himself.  He prides himself on being infantile.
...their damned souls will be ours.
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
Hell is precisely what is going on, Joey.  And we have to stop it.  I because of a special obligation, you because you're the only person who can help. And because you know what is right, and just, and true.  Will you walk with me a while?
Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
And she bought that?
Coming about, then.
I'll take a look at what you got. But I'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you say so.
You do, huh.
For a while.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
Why?
Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
Yes.  Two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision.
You are the father.
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
Just as you say, Doctor.
What position did you occupy?
I wish I could be more gracious but --
Huh?
He's bound to slip up sooner or later.
I don't, but...
Yes.
It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
I can't say. Really
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
Walk away.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
Yes... Twice.
I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
What?
The anonymous kind, Chief.
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
Look, Lieutenant. All your dough won't help you here. Because here you're on your own. And no mother to throw you a lifebelt. Now let's see how good you can swim.
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral.
Really, Professor, I--
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip?
Why not?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I do. Yes.
Good, then go.
Alright, cut, cut, cut.
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
In other words, no.
In love?  With who?
[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
I'm a professional killer.
Eh? How's that?
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
I was in the middle of --
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
We all have that dream.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights.
Okay.
Lara, please...
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
Me too.
Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise to send it back to you. It's routine, really. The actuarial people need to --
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
...and then, he'll be coming down.
Who?
'Booty Time.'
The police haven't told you?
I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.
Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.
So far, they do. But, the quantity, it does not exist. You will have to re-evaluate your needs.
-- let's talk more about your background --
Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something.
Wire it to the Western Union in Oklahoma City,
I'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel.
Thanks, buddy.  See... things weren't bad enough.  They weren't fucking bad enough!
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
Thank you.
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, that's where he's headed.
I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
My boat's neat, dad!
And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
Tsi tien, Professor Wu.
La victoire.
It wasn't much of a lie.
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
This morning? Christ. We had so much to talk about. Moe Green is out of the Tropicana, and my sons, Michael and Fredo, are taking over.
He's not home, I tell you!
I'm not a cop.
Now, try a running guy.
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
The Holiday Hotel.
You're the One, Neo.  You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I've spent most of my life looking for you.
We had to work. My family was poor.
If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
For her?
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
C'mon, it'll give us time to think about what they're going to say.
I'd like to begin.
Seven.
In other words.
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
Corridor A.
Good old Monroe.
With you.
We got to talk.
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
What's he talkin' about?
But now that you have it -
I'm, like, yelling at her, 'What are you doing?'  And she's going 'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!'  Way mental.
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
Watch your mouth, Captain.
The landlady -- as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now.
What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
We?
But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
Negative.
You're outside?
No, really...
Is it dead?
Happily.
What about your grandmother?
Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. My name's Felice.
Wladek! How are you?
Who we working for?
That's your answer to everything, Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.
Could you be more desperate to read it?
That's a dime, Martini.
I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.
We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.
Patrick?
Add it to the list.
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
You threw them out!
...Hi.
Thank you.
History, Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
I'm trying to help you. I knew she'd get her claws into you. She doesn't know anything about your investigation, so when she offers to help you, it'll be for her own reasons. Why would I lie? Do not go back to her. Take out a pen, write yourself a note, do not trust her.
You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago-  -you're still alive, Father Perrault!
It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
On my way.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
Eddie Moses, Communications Attache -- which translated from ancient bullshit means: I work for a Messenger service.
He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
It's just a matter of time.
Yes. My treat.
But my dear child, I am most at home among working men. I hate the places where you circulate -- the Hotel Clarence... This is my natural element. After all, what are any of us? Workingmen! At least, those of us who are worth our salt. Hyah?
I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...
Machine's in?
It was the mall.
I think it's time I came home now.
Mom. Believe me. I could buy all that AND the factories they came from.
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
One day it will be different. It just takes time.  We'll make new memories. You and me.
Oh, they insisted on following me.
"Welcome to Eureka."
David... please...
You win.
Huh?
175  CONTINUED:
Chi?
To see?
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
Hank was always good with the ladies. Always good-looking. Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me.
No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
What?
Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
Why don't you just try? Please. For me. Come on.
... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.
Boy can't shoot for shit, either. Goddamn that's hot.
You damn well better start working on that impulse control.  A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of <u>evidence</u>?
You're not getting a gun.
Look.
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
Yes, I believe he did.
Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
It's all right -- You're my guest.
Yeah, well, like my Grandpa used to say...you can't change your Christmas past, but you sure can exchange your Christmas presents.
Hair?
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
You're a good girl.
La de da da...
I wish you hadn't done that.
She always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. Sometimes it's just her first initial, sometime her nickname...
Yeah.
In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
From Nam?
It doesn't.
Sod.
More than eager.  He was out to make a point.
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun -- you hear that?
No: You're ON FIRE!
Yes, Daddy.
With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...
Yes, I do. I think you do too. So this is what I'll offer. You bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable. The same as you. That's the best deal you're going to get. I won't tell you you can save yourself because you can't.
I hope I'm not intruding?
Why me?
Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
Lovely.
I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.
That's what we said.
I'd love to.
I never won an Oscar.
No, King, I need you here <u>yesterday</u>...  How long do I need him for?
You what?.. What are you talking about?
And German?
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
Thank you, darling.
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
Now, you're too suspicious.
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.
Certainly not.  So what's that got to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
Tomorrow?
What's wrong?
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
I don't know these guys, but I know 'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic.  They're all the same. They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em, sink our boats, and then call us crazy.
Well, maybe you better look again.
And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.
Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
I'm simply quoting the law.
Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
Do not make light of it, Rachel. They can do it... quick! Like that! And then... then I can not sit at table with you. I can not take a thing from your hand. I... I can not go with you to meeting!  Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far! Dear child!
And this? And this?
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
These Eye-ties are really crazy when it comes to their wives.
Yeah. Like that.
No, she killed her boyfriend. Randy was a friend. MICKEY Watch out, Derek.
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.

<u>Bite</u> <u>my</u> <u>bishop</u>.
You're lying...!
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
What does that mean?
How did the wall get there?
See what, Dil?
Amphibian DNA.
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
She did like you, she helped and trusted you! You paid her back by trying to take Bill away!
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
Six or eight.  And they go wild?
But what?
You can't prove anything.
Increase his heart rate.
It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
What is the story?
Where's the stuff?
Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
You know some interesting people.
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means?
Left, left, left!
So what's wrong with that?
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
Easy Sketchy.
But the key to Islam is submission. That is why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission.
So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things.
No, but... why do you ask that?
We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
That's her pussy talkin' --He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger.  He winks at her.  The woman looks away from him, shaking her head.
No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
Yes, please.
What does he want the book for?
Don't tell me it's not the gas!
Right.
What do you want to know?
It will. Starting with your own.
<Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.
Car accident.
I was in the neighborhood.
Take it easy.
I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
Aren't you Nick Charles?
Er, fertilizer.
How do you mean?
I need a cigarette!  She left my office four years ago, we're looking for a chart...  I need a cigarette...
Surprised?
"It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay and die."
Yeah?...
Why?
Let me look.  Aww-rr...
But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
No.
You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy.  We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end.  Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail.
You use their witness.
Fuckin' Christmas, man. Fuckin, Christmas on the outs.
Why would you say that?
But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players.
I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.
When Hedda says "I'm coming" you mix a lot of martinis and you pray.
Are you a relative?
If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?
That's sick, Dante.
The strain was evident.
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
It's gonna be hot today.
He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes.
Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could.
We'll explain the whole thing to them.
I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
Hold on!
Okay, thanks.
My fight's not with you, Holliday.
Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
No .. But we have a theory ..
The baby I lost...
Elaine, what's going on?
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
The same thing.
Well then, how do you know?
Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
... just, you could look very heavy...
No.
That's funny.
But...
The rope!  The rope!
Did I ever talk about the accident?
Yeah.  I just got it.
I wasn't star--
Get this thing off me.
I don't think we've got any suitcases.
I didn't realize you cared.
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
It's not really important.
For the same reason you did, to help.
No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year.  Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.
But you must!
It means who's side are you on?
Are you sure that's what you want?
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
What?
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
How much?
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
We'll try again.
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
They're kind of fuzzy.
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
Well, I'm sort of anxious to get back to the office--
Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him --
Who are you?
Yeah, yeah...
We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.  You asked me to find you if you disappeared.  So here I am, good-bye.
Where do our records go to in the Castle?
KEEP GOING!
Switch hands.
I forgive you...
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
My meat and two veg.
Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.
Were you with him last night?
Jeff -- wives don't nag anymore -- they discuss.

Hard to say.
She kissed me.
Ah...
Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.
Passion is something one cannot control!
You lied.
Something's made you sore.
Something's wrong.
I need to talk to you about Will Graham.
Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?
Yes?
Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
You can be John Malkovich.
We'll rub.
Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
We're taking back the Tourelles!
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
And I'm tearful!
What?
Did you ahh, love him?
What... is... happening... ?
Here?
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. It's no big deal. I promise.
Oh.
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
Let's waste him.  No offense.
He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
Who fired everyone?
What do you think?
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
Do what?
It always is.
Since when?
Well, what was yours?
Well, I really don't drink...
I'll make it.
Al ???!!!
Darned if I don't!
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
Miss me?
I'm sorry.  It was an accident.
I don't want to live anymore.
Might as well siddown a minute, Clara.
No.
Shit, we just started.  But I better log out of this.
Where the music's playing and the ladies are...
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
Do you realize how many people would kill to be sitting here right now? Come on, it's grad night. You've got your whole life to be uptight.
Done like a champion.  Can you reach me with the line?
I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin.  Surely you knew that.
Slut.
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
Touch of the flu.
What did you want to happen?
You killed him here?  In this city, outside that bank?
Don't worry about me, just go.
To what?
Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
Did he say why?
At an operation?
Are you a 5 or a 6?
Do you?
Let me hear it!
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
I think you have the wrong number.
Have fun.
Do you?
That's a fact.
I don't know yet.
Who the hell ever is.  This is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. These bills aren't even <u>in</u> circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange.
Lucky you got out, that water's got quite a pull, and it empties straight into the ocean.
What's his name?
No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
Pull them back!
You didn't see the look she threw me. She's up to something.
But Stoltzfus said...
Yea!
Five feet?  Seven feet?
Well, I'd sooner mug an old lady...
I don't know, honey.
What's left of him. He'll never see outside of the Star and Garter.
It's a flop house.
Right.
You don't have a piece of the action?
They just don't want us going in there.
Bye.
Your pay.
Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
I knew where I was all the time.
It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks.
Yeah, no shit I just told ya.  Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It says, "Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy."
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
I hope I didn't keep you from something.
Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
Are you the leader of tis group?
Santos... It isn't.
It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
Wait --
But we can't just dig it up!
Good night??!
We'll be done pretty soon....
Cowan--
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
Yes.
It takes time --
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
As long as we've got that straight.
What about Room 237?
Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
Oh, yeah?
I'll show you.
And how do you suggest I do that?
Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer.
Where?
What sales?
Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me.
Keep your voice down!
The food will make you feel bedder. Look at me -- I'm da happiest guy I know!
No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
Cold is good--  Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
The title?
No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
How intuitive! That must take years of training right there. Maybe you can guess what has upset me.
Just a second, Mr. President.
I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
Yup. The whole rig. I don't care much about the rest, but I surely will miss that bay. Least they didn't kill me. That was right considerate, I thought. They were laughing when they left me. Thought it was real funny. I walked for a little while but there was no use, so I gave it up. Figured it was just bad luck.
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
Jesus, would you stop? You make my head hurt when you talk about this.
Hi, uh.  Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. "Ever want to be someone else?" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. "Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding..."
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
I know.
Wanna fool around?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
You said in L.A., anything goes.
--a Wiccan--
We thought you was dead, you know.  It's okay that I live here?
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
Tame those rights...you know, we're even freighting in a couple of exiled Argie trade unionists from Paris for a TV tie in.  One of them had his balls tap-danced on by the secret police.  The other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police-- yes my good man?
What?
Thanks.
Gee, I don't know, Crabs...  Improvise. You're good at that.
These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...
Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
Like you taught me...
Sociologist.  And because.  Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners.  They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.
I'm sorry, Pierce.  You're going out with Marcus. Duty calls. The City needs you.
If we ... er ...
Frances?
No.  It's nice and cozy.
He isn't a man.
You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
What is her disposition?
Sounds boring.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
I see.  May I?
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
F for...
Won't they come out here?
That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
The Big Picture.
I believe the boys got a couple.
My feet hurt...
Nice to see you.  What am I doing in here?
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
And what about the other fella?
Maybe we can...  Skipper, is there a snorkel on this sub?
Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?
C'mon, you know that won't...
Drugs Judge, they're gonna flood West Oakland with dope. Jack you up and string you out like a two dollar whore. And while the community's shuffling for a fix, they're gonna snuff every Panther they can find.
Dyslexic?
Sure.
Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
Six months.
Kinda early for Christmas, Bugs.
All right, what is it now?
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
Go home.
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.
The picture's fine. That's the way she looks in real life.
You wouldn't!
You don't like me? You hate me?
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
What party?
I think it went on rather too long.
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
What am I supposed to do?
Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
Don't mix your metaphors.
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
Jessie, I reached the top of the Tower.  So far, no sign of anyone.  Looks like a phoney call. Over.
Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
It's stupid to lie to me, Miss Schmidt. I'm in a position to help you.
Oh.
We haven't got time.  You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight.
That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
No, not like this one.
I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
I don't want to understand it. This isn't one of your science projects. I just want to fix it. Fast!
Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.
Neil, please --
Weight Station.
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
Oh, Jesus, Johnny...
Look!
No!
What did you hear?
No.
No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
Still well on our side...
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
She used those words?
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.
Outside!
How you, Radar?
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
I told her Thank You Very Much, but it was inconvenient because...uh... because...
That's me.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
Don't get up.  And don't act as if I were the queen mother.
Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
So?
Good-bye.
Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other.
Of course not.
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
S'alright. I'm sorry too. Shit, I gotta take a leak... Pull over at that gas station.
She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
Jeremy listen to what--
I must ask you to leave.
Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were --
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
Say it.
I think you better put him on ice, man.
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
Do you want me to stop?
What's it mean?
How'd you know?
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
So what's it going to be?
As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.
You turned Renard.
Well, son, she's doin' a damn sight better 'n you right now.
She expects me to marry her.
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
Why?
We-are-mobilizing-to-defend-<u>her</u>.
We DO sleep lying down.
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
Oh, some shit.
He has a great body
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
Take no offense Trevor. I see many patients a day and have an awful memory.
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
You seem pretty sure of yourself. You've led something of a charmed life haven't you Mr. Wells?
He died in the bathroom.
How do you mean?
My God...
You drink about sixteen Diet Cokes a day. You're an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home. You drink bourbon, but you offer your clients scotch...
That's impossible, man.  This fence is high-tensile.  The breaking tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino, easy. I know, I put it up.
Obviously I was wrong!
Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's a lot smarter than you.
Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke.
Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
I'm busy.
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
I yield.
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
It's only a tale.
I can go to the bar.
You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
You sew very badly.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
Never is a very long time, Wayne. A word only the weak use. I'm not a sore loser. Even if I don't have a leg to stand on, I'm going to get up and fight this world until I'm on top again.
...I just swore my life away, back in that...
What?
Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
Nah, why should you?
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
Gone.
You didn't?
No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses.
I love red!  That's my favorite color!
Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
Shut up!
Thanks so much for planning it, Letty. Jake's really looking forward to it.
Allen?  He... he's okay?
Lower it!
Right.  That gives us...
I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
I don't want to find out.
Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter.
It's e-vit-able.
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
Peter keeps asking me out.
First things first.
What kind of wife did you say she was?
My wife used to call me Lenny.
What friend?
Right.
Get that out of your trunk.
I don't think you--grasp--the situation, Mr. Myers.
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
No, not that.  I was just wondering -- in the bedroom scene in reel two why did Simone have no reflection when she walked in front of that mirror?
When may I expect the cleaners?
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
Not interested.
The type they marry.
It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
Another one?
You know you are. Loveliest woman I ever set eyes on.
No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
Shit. Here we go again.
No, it could take me hours. You know what it's like trying to find things in this town, not to mention disposable stuff - I wouldn't think they've ever heard of them.
Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!
You had it the entire time?!
Nothin'.  Want another drink?
And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.
Big, big money.
Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
Well I can.
If my hurt is to be that you will write no more, then I shall be the sorrier.
How are you, Richard?
Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or the Big O.
Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
Thank God we got you away from her, huh?
We stopped seeing each other.
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
And move to Long Island.  Number Two: my ex-husband lost all my property, all my money in his scheme to build a Black business empire.  Needless to say what happened, this house is it, all I got.  I'm too through with yar people.
When we were cleaning out Dr. Lector's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book... We got him out of there and dug around...
Of course it does.
I'm having a blast.  God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball.
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
You could check. It'd be in his files.
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
It's fine.
What?  What did you say?
Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
Ed... I'm sorry.
Yesterday.  We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story on 'Sixty Seconds'.  Biggest market crash since twenty-four.
Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time...
Mostly old garbage.  Today we found a '48 Hudson.
Amen.
No?  Why's that?
Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.'  But you had to go.
There you go again -- you know I didn't mean it that way, Fran. Just get well -- do what the nurse tells you -- I mean Baxter -- and I'll see you as soon as I can. Bye, Fran.
We've been talking about her, mostly.
He tried to kill you, Starla.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
Yeah, why?
If we stand a chance at all, it's only by sticking together.
Yes, naturally.
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
Sure, right.
The door opened.  You got it.
Who gives a shit!
I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.
As far away as I ever want to be.
It's loaded.
Good.  What I can do is set you up down in the --
Kim-Lo?
Well, that all depends.
At the seven-eleven.
Story's the same, Detective...
Twelve seventy-five from the Clarence? The son-of-a-gun made a detour!...  But he got you here.
Right, steam. A car you could ride around in and not cause a stink. But do you know, they will not even let us have it. Can you believe it? Why?! Man! He likes to create a stink. I wrote them a note once, and told them to clean it... I mean, don't you see that? It's just filthy! I mean, I've seen filth you wouldn't believe! Oofh, what a stink! I don't even want to talk about it...
The speech is excellent.  "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible.
I'd soon die.
That's none of your business.
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
But don't they have it in English?
I'll tell you what. When I get my engineering degree and I'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.
Panty hose. Work better'n stockin's. Pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head. You get the pistol.  Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it. Once they notice the Ithaca and the Smith, they'll know we ain't foolin' with 'em.
Like I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
No, protecting her.
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
This is too weird.
Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?
Sure.  Follow me.
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
That doesn't make sense.
...yes?...
Then what do you want to stay with me for?
In the back.  Down the other corridor.
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
I don't have a choice.
THEN WHO DID?!
I have a family.
Judgement Day ...
I was an American, I just didn't know it yet...
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
You said you hated him.
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
Yup.
No.
The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
Oh.
Sure I know Maya. Real well.
How do I stop it?
I am?
Good enough for one - two would look suspicious... killed while attempting escape... now that's convincing for both.
He can't stay up there.
For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "Do you hate me!" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate.
--Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
Nothing happened.
Needs brightening ...
I hope so, Mr. Reynard.
Are you really?
Save yourself....
Can you say anything but "cool"?
In the coffin, my dear.  where else...?
Y-you used to-- Oh, no!  Yeah, I care.  You used to be so ambitious and...  God, you really liked it?!
What? Did you let that child play with one of my toys? I don't like children playing with my toys.  Have to fix you up with another hammer, won't we. Give her a saucepan to play with, that'll do.
We have the urn.
It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --
Yeah, well if I claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? Jesus... the cops were probably right. My uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him.
Make it stop! What's wrong!! I'm scared!!!
I heard you! Now 'stead of bein' smart, you just get that car out of here!
It worked.  How many men can you raise?
Whatever you say, man.  I didn't see shit.  The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all.
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
I don't understan' it, Tom.
Where are the women?
If you say so.
Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.
What do you want?
...what...?
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.
Sparkling rocks?
Well, you should.
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
-- Plus we've got a baritone with a balalaika coming from The Russian Tea Room.  I've dressed him in a Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson Eddy songs.
Hello...
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
You guys are being real assholes
What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
Move!
Probably.
Oh, hi.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
Why? All my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and they've been married for twenty years.
One seventy-nine.
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
You gotta help.
How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
Heal who?
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
Fuck you.
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.
Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
No shit?!?! You know him?
It's gonna be fine.
You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
I'd send them up, but sadly, I don't trust the young lady to find you on her own.
I have to.
You try. You try talking to her.
You're saying "me."
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates?  I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on- the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.
Tell him we'll be back on the highway in a second.
I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.
Going on... like...?
Ordell pick up his bond?
I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
Right.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
What is it, a still life?
I don't talk about her that much.
From you?
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.
No.
Something like that -
Because I think I'm wrong.
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in -
Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
Please.  Don't worry about him.  And above all, don't antagonize him.
If I don't 'grow up...'
No.
Oh, my lord, you will not shake me off, she never needed me more, I sear by your breeches!
To recruit you.
He's not here.  It's a blind alley.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
...Is he brown?
You said we could go to New York.
Yeah. I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison. Must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week.
Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
Computer, can it be repaired?
Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
Joan or Margaret Smith.
Really?
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
She doesn't have to take her panties off, we can see her stomach with 'em on. All she has to do is pull up her dress and let us see her belly.
Mom?
The same as the first time...
Palmdale.
She disappeared Friday night. We got reason to believe foul play might be involved.
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
Trust me.
No, he isn't.
Could be...But I don't like this business. It smells fishy to me.
Why not? I'm hungry.
What time was that?
Which one's which?
Anytime.
No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
It's not for sale.
Oh, don't say those words!
Fuck off, Dave.
That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
And then Sunday?
Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out?
What if I keep dropping?
O-kay.  We'll skip that question.
Congratulations, Enzo.
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters.
What's going on?
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.
Get out of our way.
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
I can't imagine any place better than here.
Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and - and - and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?
You still questioning any Cubans?
Fine. Think about this one, then: how do you know you exist?
I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.
I'm sorry, I didn't.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
Really?
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.
Yeah, I mean, come on, going through the Iron Curtain is supposed to be crawling underneath barbed wire, it's supposed to be strangling a guard...
And I'll just shitkick in my usual way.
Sorry.
Mmm.
Well, rack up your cue. We're leavin'.
WhatÃ­s going to make him do that?
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
Who are these people?
You need to get out more.
Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
About every ninety seconds, the auto- pilot jogs us to the west.
I don't need a job. I have a quest.
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here.  We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold.  All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.
How soon?
We wait. This is an elevator.
Uh-huh.
She likes to play bingo.
Answer the question--
Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico.
Uh... got any cinnamon?
Here, I'll take a dozen of those things. Miss Paine.
You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
What class?
Which hospital?  Did you take me back?
'Morning, honey.
But you hate Joey
Yes, but.
I guess he got the message...
Beautiful place...
What was it?
She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over.  Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
First things first.
Thank you, Sir.
Then where did it-- ? Sir.  Forgive me, but it makes no sense. worked my ass off to grad--
You say the cutest things.
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
"I die knowing no one knew the real me."
Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. Just follow the line.
Well, now, don't go creating some artificial environment for yourself.
Did you dress her up like this?
Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Congratulations. Marvellous thing.  Bravo.
Mom, come out!
Musta got some primo bondsman.
Bullshit it is. I said, about as loud as I could say it, "no jail time for my guys."
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
Carl, it's a jungle.  I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles.  You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for.
Reinforcements?  Where??
Can you swim?
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
Mr. President, we must launch. A delay now would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities!
Yeah. Well.  Gettin' up here, Boss.
Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
Vodka tonic.
She says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months.
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
The water tastes better in the kitchen.
Good-night.
Very.
What happened?
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
None of the above, thank you.
No, I really don't.
Yeah, all those women who went feline this afternoon...They're so ashamed now..
It's not for sale at any price.
Who?
If you reach out, you could get pulled over yourself.
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.
Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
Try me.
Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass.
Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
And--
We haven't.
I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
It's what I'm countin' on.
I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.
I'm no longer a man! I awoke to discover I'd turned into a sparrow!
Sir, these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville! They are a gift from the people of France!
He'll come around.
It's fine.
A flaw in your research, my dear. I grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast.
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
It's safe.
Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
I'm a wolf?
So if it's a show and they have a guy die that's writing, but if it's real and they have a guy die that's murder.
His will.
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
Who's "Eleanor?"
What about crack?  You a user?
Including the death of your husband?
The Vice Squad?
Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.
Heh heh. This is the best night of our lives.
Then your father's a wimp.
Lady Van Tassel.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got <u>Smith</u>!  <u>I've got Smith</u>!!

No.
Oh, Rosie.
... I don't know...
This way, sir.
That's okay.  I understand.
Where are you going?
Yes.
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
I am who I am.  I can't deny it, anymore than you can deny who you are.  I like sex different -- I like it wild.  That's not a crime.  I loved Andrew.  We made love together.  We made it differently, but we still made love.  It was our way.  It was private -- and now the whole world wants to look in through the pretense of justice.  If I was some middle-aged divorcee who screwed him once a week do you think this would be happening to me?
It's a novel.
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
Have you looked inside?
Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
You would have done that?
I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
And what about you?
I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now.
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
Yeah?
I guess it depends on what you give up on.
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
You're more than that, Luther.  They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  They want you back in.
And what may I ask brought this on?
That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
Easy, son.  You just need to get Your feet back under you, that's All.  Come on, boy, let's kick South.  Down to the old playground.
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
Goodnight.
So he could have gone out to the base, hopped the fence, dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack.
Um-hum.
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
God, if he doesn't come back --
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
This is a travesty.  A debacle.
Ratan!
I'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.
True.
You're not worried that someone might take him?
If you go, I go.
Faith, Betty.  But make sure it's your own.
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Where does that lead to?
If that's a problem, then I'll make arrangements to stay with some friends.
How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
Yeah.
What is the name of your informant?
I can see that.
Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit -
Oh shit, we're late.
Sorry, Pritchett, here you go.
Is that a trick question?  C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
... Me, too.
Can you stop that slaughter?!  Can you free these men?
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
What problem?
Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license.  And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?
No!  Hi! So great to meet you!
Is that right?
Clothes.
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
You should learn a little patience.
The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it.
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
We don't have any proof of that.
The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
There are others.
M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
Stable.  We're looking at low twenties.  It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons.  What the fuck do you think?
Well, yeah, but --
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
Let's not talk about that now, okay?
Her name's Sandy ...
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
Left you...? Who? Emily?
The gas tank's going to go any second!
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
I thought you'd never ask.
You know the best thing about being a Skipper is the worst thing.  It's all my responsibility.  So I'll tell you what George, you stay off of my bridge, and I'll stay out of your galley.  We'll get along that way.
This doesn't make sense.
I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.
That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
Then we shall all zalute Feldwebel von und zu Schulz! About face!
One that looks nice.
No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.
I think he'll find that satisfying.
Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
If you say so.
Why don't you?
You're right, this is bad.  How did you get out?
I want to now who I'm talking to.
I know that, Mister Man--they also call them serials. I'm not stupid, you know.  Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, and once it was a no-brakes chapter, the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out, but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned and--I was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe I was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was Rocket Man trying to get out, and here came the cliff and JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered--  --but I didn't cheer, I stood right up and started shouting, "This isn't what happened last week--have you all got amnesia?--THEY JUST CHEATED US--THIS WASN'T FAIR--"
No...
You don't like brussel sprouts?
OK. Boy. Jesus!
Then don't let him be seeing you talking to me. I don't want him twisting my arm off.
Thanks
Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
Who?
There's another choice.
"Minor glitch" with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe.
Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss.
Eight o'clock.
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
I know it.
... I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
Nothing.
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
I call all you white guys "Jack."
No.
Where are you taking me!?
Not particularly.
Anyway, so what?
Thanks.
Definitely! I love him!
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
...not that you learned anything, Chunk.
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
Where is it?
I'm a puppeteer.
You're not rotting meat.
You wouldn't be putting me out.
I like to think so! It's this little idea I been working on!
We're not out of this yet.
You took quite a beating. You must lie down.
It's reply paid.
Great, get in. We'll switch off in a bit.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
He's got a lot on his mind besides Buffalo Bill... His wife, Bella, is real sick. Comatose... I'm tellin' you about it now, 'cause he may never.
Know what?
A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
No. Not particularly.  How come?
You don't think of me that way, do you?
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
You bring me such peace...
Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.
You're not holding him right ... Caz ...
Shut up.
It strikes me that Eve's disloyalty and ingratitude must be contagious!
Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
Jesus...
Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
You want to kiss me...
Put them on screen!
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
I think that'll be fine.
Why?
Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
But you're his brother.
Yes.
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! Come this way!]
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
Maybe.
Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
You're not dying.
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
You have no conception of this, do you?
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
Abigail.
End of line.
Yeah... I mean so he knows... He doesn't even know.
I know.
Move in with me.
She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
He WILL.
The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
God!  Unbelievable.  Vampires.
Can you get us in there, past security?
What?
Be surprised what these will fetch in the Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here -- easy, easy. Very rare.
... Thanks.
Shit!
I knew this guy last summer in the Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other. But she had this huge weight problem. His friends taunted him mercilessly about it. You know, "How do you breathe when she sits on your face?" "It's embarrassing for you to be seen with her." Finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her. She flipped and he went on the defensive. I distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again. "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up."  Poor fatty never had a chance.
<i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you.
Yes.
Here -- here --
A telegram from Moscow! It must have been here all day!
We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?
It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --
H... how?
Go to hell.
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
Likewise I'm sure.
Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?
Millions - if anybody wants it.
So do you...been a long day.
I can see that but where ?
And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
So they know everything.
You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em.
Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
Could we hear to the moon?
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
You betcha!
Yes, you did.
He can't read. Even dumber than you. Couldn't write his own name. X -- that's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone. One big lousy X like our flat. Condemned. By order of City Hall.
Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
What's your business?
Did you call someone you knew?
Yeah.
You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.
Roma.
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
No...
I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
...yeah...
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
I'm going back home with Harry.
Why would they do all that if we weren't?
We're actresses.
As a matter of fact, I do.
Maybe I wasn't responsible for the car accident...
Yes.
No, I won't...
Please...
Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?
And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
Mmmhmmm.
Because I...  ... Because she'd never speak to me again.
Sure have, Sam.
Bugging the District Attorney's office of New Orleans!  It's outrageous!
<u>Yes</u>:  she is saying this in Albanian, <u>but</u> she's doing it not to be uh...  But because, she explains, that is the only way it can be understood by her Aged and Sainted Mother, who is standing there with her, dressed in her Traditional...
No.
All right. Then I'll do it. Because I don't care about me anymore. I just want you to love me.
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
That's right.
Skye!  I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually.  You read the book again?  Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park.  Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left.
All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
Don't you see...
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
There's the rub.
That's it!
Around twelve-thirty.
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence.  A Shep Proudfoot.
The pearls are in her room.
Who's Dil?
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Well, good luck with the job.
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
Give me the gun.
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
I bet he don't. Karl likes me.
Huh?
Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!
-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
Open it.
....yeah....
David says Jack comes to warn him.
What does arresting us get them?
Life is just a state of mind.
Get him out of here. He's knocking the programme's image!!
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
Welcome to public school, my friend.
Tomorrow night?
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
That's not going to happen!
I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
Yeah.
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people - that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need - a fella could do worse.
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
Play one.  Educate yourself.
Oh.
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
Aye, aye, sir.
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
Call it a hunch.
Yes -- oh!
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
Whatta we do now?
Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
I stole four beers from my dad.
His physical condition.
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
It is tomorrow.
No! I swear I don't know! Please!
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
Are you sure you want to encourage this?  No, you're right, let's have some fun. So, what did happened next, "Betty"?
No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom.  You just help me win.  Understood?
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
Is V'ger the Captain of the alien vessel?
HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!
Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
He's okay.
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
You know who it is.
I don't wanna talk about it!
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
My liege ... forgive me ...
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
Gotta go, Donna. I'll call you tomorrow.
You know.  Look at me like -- like I look at women.
I got your boy killed.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
I don't watch the new ones.
I still feel like shit.
They was a boy. We made friends.
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
Oh! Great. That's great!
How long have I got?
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
I know.
I never was.
Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
Who are you?
What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
You've flipped your wig!
I was just asking, Bill.
I'm not trying to be anything--I'm just doing nothing! If I wait and see long enough, then--with any luck-- I won't *ever* have to make up my mind! Decisions can be painful, after all...
I don't know.
D 'n D?
And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic.
Why not?
No thanks, I--
She said convincingly.
My legacy.
Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?
Shit.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
Okay, darling.
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
Goodbye!  See you!
He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
Well, we've got something in common then.
Right at our one-eyed friend!
I was on threshold of great things.
You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be where your head used to be.
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
Lily, I don't think even you could know that --
Fewer will survive them.
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
You'll convince her. You have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong... and beautiful ... even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know.
No, I...
...Worse?
A smaller bowl of flowers.
No!  No, that's OK.  I like to.  I love boiling water.  It's a specialty of mine.  Why don't you go watch cartoons?
Can anybody hear me!
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
[Who are you?]
What do you remember about her.
I suppose it is.
I miss her.
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
Aaagh! Rape!
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to me that way.  I didn't rob the place...
I didn't say it, she did. How'd you happen to get in that line of work?
That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
What?
Bye-bye, Elena.  ...What an idiot! What an idiot! 'Nice day'! Christ!!
Look.  Do we have a problem here? There's no reason to have a problem. I'm gonna make you feel real good.  You wanna Czech girl? After I'm done with you, you won't miss her.  Now why don't you pay me?
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
Absolutely. We would be honored.
You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
Guys like me take those chances. Let's go.
At once, Jacques.  We'll continue later.
I didn't have much to do with it.
I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here.  You don't learn it in a couple of weeks.  I studied it in high school.
I want to know what he told you last night.
But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.
Come on.
Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell.
He's all doped up.
There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.
Excuse me.
A spinal injury, in the line of duty. It was in Kitty's report...
What's the difference?
What about the share.
Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
Then it's time to change that --
I didn't start this, R.L.
I'd like to go outside with him, in the open air.
How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
What's it about?
You're going to have to get a new one.
Yeah it was all just an accident.
I don't have any idea.
You won't breathe nothing' - not even air.
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
Got a nice evening dress?
We're not all frigid.
You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
What 'look'?
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
HARRY's treasure chest? Sure. I know where that is.
My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
Not even a single lifetime.
You can see so many here.
The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.
Keeps out the alpha rays, Max. You don't get old.
No, I couldn't do that.
My dad died.  My dad, my dad.
No, no they know another track - to the side of this.
How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.  Where the hell is that thing?
You decide.
I know that.
Yeah?
How was I leading you on?
Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
Replacement party.
You know how I know? 'Cause Reynard says he's guilty, and Reynard's full of shit! Look --
Yes?
No, don't ask me!
Look buddy, I'm a big star.  I've got real offers from real studios.  I don't need to blow some dentist for a part.  So forget it!
I'm not.
The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good!  Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.
I know.  Get out here.
I'm sorry, Bob.
How can I help you with the particles?
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
--Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--
I'll walk...
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
We cannot. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Other think you'll pay them Mornay's wages. We bid you to Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, two days from now, at sunset. Pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you. Scotland will be one.
I haven't seen you around here before.
Racist asshole came at me.
You staying for dinner?
I don't know what you're talking about, man. I swear. This is some weird shit you're telling me... and I don't know how come you're doing it.
Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?
...What?
Why not?
I wasn't so sure. I just liked the odds.
We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.
I've anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate is ready.
There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
Not power.  Not control.
Bon Jour.
Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
None of your business, but it's in the cab.  That's all mine.  When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty.
I'm sorry.  I was on a roll.  I meant something else.  When do you want to leave?
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
I had sold my fucking soul.
Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start.
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
Someone not from Maine.
I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.
I am a trained performer.
You, Arlo.
No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
I understand that.  I'm sorry to hear that. We'd be well advised to deal with this situation now.  The insurance company - -
What about the President?
Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
On the floor?
Okay, okay.
Now, how is Miyamoto gonna know in <u>advance</u>?  That Carl loses two batteries.  Must happen once ever' 20 years or so.
Were you there to catch me?
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
No one's forcing her.
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
Maybe you should, but you can't.
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
What about tonight?
Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.
I don't know, Booth.
What makes you think you can trust him?  He didn't do shit.
Remember the Maine...
Well, I'm definitely seventeen and  now definitely late--
Nothing but CDs in there.  I thought maybe you'd like some Celine or Whitney.
Go back to sleep.
Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
I'm fine, sir.
Give her a chance, will you?
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
So I've been informed.
Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
You have no one to blame but yourself.
Sure I'm sure. Buddy, you got that mischievous look in your eyes. You used to smile just like that when you were a baby sleeping, just like that.
I did.  At Blue Balls.
Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
Oh, yeah. There.
It never occurred to me.
Quod nomen mihi est?
Three minutes, 51 seconds.
Where?
Thanks.
That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?
Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an accomplice. We'll release him until his indictment, keep tight surveillance, and see if he leads us to your disc.
You've already been that. C'mon.
No way.
Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
No shit.
No.
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
What are you talking about?
They moved you from the Diplomat?
Whatever that thing is, we have to kill it!
Um-hmm.
Don't let me fall!
You think she's gonna make it?
I will if they don't send me back.
Please thank Inspector Goetz for taking care of me last night.
No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.
Yeah?
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
You don't?
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?
The river at this point is the most dangerous on the East Coast.  Years ago, hundreds of ships went down here.
That was a joke.
Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --
Well, maybe one.
I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
Of course not.
It's not that kind of job.
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
I don't see anything.
Everybody down!  ON THE DOUBLE!!
The Orpheum.
From where??!!
You okay?
How soon?
Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
What are you talking about?
No problem.
I've been working out.
What's wrong?
Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
No, sir...
That's it.  Get out.  Now!
Then why don't he holler like he usta?
I seem to recognize this routine. First the kiss then the touch.  Oh, what's the use. You're you.
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
Fine.
OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
What did you say?
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
You want me to go up with you?
Mrs Brown.
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
Whatever you're getting paid, I can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more.
Very good, Joe. Now, Belinda, I've got a figure over here, of one million, five. I...
Of course.
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.
I was.
I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
Master Hardenbrook...
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
I know that.
Did 'ya have fun with her? Sweet as a peach, I bet. Huh? Huh?
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
I got eight thousand yards. Radius is five...
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
Not exactly.
Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych department, see what I can find out.
So it could have been neither of them?
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
If you want to call it that.
Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome.
She ain't retarded, she's shy.
Good night.
No.
What!?
Marcia, please.
It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?
The debts.
What are you saying?
Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
What?  Where is she?
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
Let's just say "music" - that way you only use up one...  Wait, we have to go in here for a second...
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
Why would I do that?
Delighted, I'm sure.
Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.
Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches --
Yes.
And we're very grateful.
What about my neck?
Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.
I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
Maybe.
Roger.
I'll get you close.
What? Who?
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
I bet you hear everything I say!
Okay, then, I'll take you to dinner.
I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
Who's on him?
Yeah --
I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
Yes, the police must be called.
Well divide 18 into three
Actually.  I could only help him.
Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
What?
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
That's the reason?
I'm not afraid of the dark.
I won't be able to.
Things change.
She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering <u>yours</u>.
We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
Which is--
You drive away business roarin' in like that.
I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace.
Thank you.
Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see?
Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last night, huh? That's a shocker. You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood? You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude.
He once made me an improper suggestion.
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
You mentioned information.
Sure.
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
Civil?  I'm civil.
I'm not a nai-ive little...
They grow outside, don't they?
You have to say that.
I kissed him back.
This is crazy.
No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?...
Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
Then why stay in the hills.
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
Talk to me, Charlie.
Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good.
I don't smoke?
So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
Lucy isn't you. We're losing something without you being here. Now, I know this is a rough time for you, but I think we should make another arrangement.
She's a colored woman, from Harlem!
Brad Wilson.
Still got your sense of humour.
Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?
Were you adopted, Bob?
What're we going to do?
Then he will die!
ooohhhhhh no.
Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
Almost four years.
Why not? But for Christ's sake, just do it fast!
Not this one.  This one's on me.
You got till the count of three. Then you end up like him.
Gordo?
Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again.
You've always loved the animals.
Seriously, I think we should get married.
...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street.
I'm honored to know this man.
Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
No, Ken. I need to see him now...
You'll want a cocktail dress then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful figure.  A little too out in the open but simply lovely.  Size six? Do you need shoes?
No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you!
Trust me on this Kate.  I really don't think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
Sure.
"And though he's slippery, he still gets caught."
Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
You!
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
Boss, you don't need reasons to hit me.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
To hide the evidence.
Well good n-
What do you want to know, Evan?
All the important stuff.  Wrap it up for me.
My dog, Archie... I woke up with flea bites... Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well.
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
That's so sweet, Michael. But, really, I've so many things to do.
Respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you.
You shouldn't have.
Oh.
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
Thanks.  Bullshot.
Good luck at the academy.
Yeah.
Sit down.
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
That's very wise.

I don't know.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
Where's Luc and Pierre?
Yeah, yeah, I know.  But say I hadn't seen it and I said to you, "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," what would you think?
You'll have to find that out, won't you?--
Yes I did.
Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS.
King of the WHO?
Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.
What?
No gentleman caller, Doc.  Not that I care. I've had it with men. They're so fascinated by their own crap. Took me four years to get the last one out. Almost turned me into a dyke... These days my idea of a hot date is a long shower by myself before bed. Now that feels good. And you don't have to do all that... listening.
Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
Later when?
Perry?
Which part?
I think...it...works.
Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.
I don't know...
Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government.  I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!
The only danger of turbulence is in the Heart -- and we're not going through it.  Once in the Carotid Artery, we'll remain in the Arterial System... until we reach the point of damage --  -- where Dr. Duval will attempt to dissolve the clot with a laser beam. After the operation, we'll return by way of the Venous System --  -- until we reach the base of the neck --  -- where we'll be removed right here -- with a hypodermic.
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
Tell me one?
I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.
26th off Wilshire.
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
Lock the fucking doors.
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
No, he didn't.
What, did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut.
Open up.
How about inviting me over to dinner?
It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...
There is one problem.
No. I said nobody knew she was coming to the hotel.
It had been deemed classified.
Master Kong.
Yes!  I believe I am!
That's Charity. She's out back. She'll be free in half hour.
Of course.
Crossing the border this time of night they're a bit particular. You'd have to prove your identity, you know... unless you've got a passport. They might even want to know why you're in such a hurry.  Otherwise they might think...
You remember that much?
It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?
I know.
Doesn't answer the question.
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
Yes...yes, that's true.
My child?  No...but...
You go.  Send me a postcard.
Damn.
What do you do on the other days?
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
You know what happened.
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going--
Bobby--
Why bring it here?
Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
Well, that's fine --
Use Salino.  It'll take a little longer, but there won't be any holes in it.
Thank you; but it's missing something.
Yeah!
Miss Weathers.
Okay, okay, Fran. I deserve that. But just ask yourself -- why does a man run around with a lot of girls? Because he's unhappy at home -- because he's lonely, that's why -- all that was before you, Fran -- I've stopped running.
I have heard of them.
Dmitri <u>Gusunov?</u> What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him.  They're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...
Oh it does???
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
M'hm.
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
Hello.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
He does.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
Tuesday.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
Good evening, Mademoiselle.
I hate it.
They got a saloon there?
Why not?
New worlds.
Did you hear that?
Good.
If you knew, why didn't you say anything?
Certainly is.
Just a little bit too much, I think.
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
Huh?
We have some mutual friends in Washington.
And we can watch ...
How'd you know?
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with <i>Chimera</i> needed it as well.
Candidate for what?
Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
You're Brill.
Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?
I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
You've come to rescue me?
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and...
Have I slept long?
Yes.
No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here...
As I told you about English policemen.
Mommy read it to ne.
I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems to be matching up...
I like your stories.
As often as you like -- now, please -- for the love of God -- sign!!
Your honor must lower his voice.
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
The clip's not gonna hold!
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
What am I, five?
All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake, at least.
You don't have to go with me at all! Just give me my son's money and you can stay here forever as far as I'm concerned. Stay with that murderer you caught!
Well, where is it? I-
This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded.
I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
Yes. I have never known birds of different species to flock together. The very concept is unimaginable.  Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance. How could we possible hope to fight them?
That's good. That's very good. Now Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford, check the oil and tires, we don't want any problems on the road. One more thing... If anybody but you comes back...
Sure, it's a meal ticket for me. I admit it, but it's also a windfall for somebody like Mr. Norton who's trying to crash national politics.  That's what you bought the newspaper for, isn't it? You wanta reach a lotta people, don't you?  Well, put John Doe on the air and you can reach a hundred and fifty million of 'em. He can say anything he wants and they'll listen to him.
Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.
Call security.
Not yet.
That's right.
I'm drinking.
Burbage has my keeping but you have my heart.
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
Man and boy.
I have to talk to her about my experimental film.  It's very... experimental.
I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.
Was who Meredith?
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
No.
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
No!
No.  But once I heard...
Anything you didn't understand?
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--
I think it was England.
Can I feel 'em?
Yes. Yes.
But didn't we know it would happen?
What do you mean "bad?"
I'm so happy you're happy.
Yes?
What kind of words?
You found him.  I don't know how to thank you.
Eighteen.  And it's "Hebrew".
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
You're not Reman.
Roger.
Yes.
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
You mean that?
I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
I am the One who wants to breathe thru your nose and taste thru your mouth.
Please.  Come.  Sit.
Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle.
Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
It would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you.  But first things first.
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --
A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ...  You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ...
And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
The human?
I used to take great pleasure in that, being purposefully different, rubbing people's noses in it. Didn't you do that when you were younger?
WRONG!  I'm getting my first series of hormone shots!  And once those babies kick in, they're gonna remove my organs, and MAKE ME A WOMAN!
Of course.  I attended Eton -- it wouldn't do for a master's son to attend where his father taught.  I was to go up to Oxford but the war broke out and I never made it.  The Great War, you know.  You had a Good War, but we had a great one.
How do I know?!
We have to make it an early night.
Did you hear me?
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
Yes!
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
You're on.  Let's go! An' keep it quiet.
I manage them.
Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
And now...?
'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
Right.  Yeah.  Forgotten.
What kind of signal?
Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
Tomorrow.
'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.
You can't come here.
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
Hello, Tony.
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
What the hell is going on?
Goddammit, I am sick of this --
You're a good man Nicholas.
I...
Week after I'm twenty-one.
He's carrying the damn <u>flag</u>.
Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD.  Jay winces.
I'm so sorry, Laura.
No more, man.
You mean a picture?
Where's the money?
Don't think I know him.
&quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot;
We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael. He'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword.
I like to keep it professional, that's all.
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.
You're being deliberately obtuse.
Not so far as I'm concerned, you're not.  Yes?
Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
That's what I told them.
I see.
You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary?
Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>.  See you around the galaxy...
Ain't that something. The mad monk of Manhattan. Here goes nothing.  Listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion.
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
The flower.  Bluebells.  To hear them ringing means your life's at an end.
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help.
Right.
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
So, have you given him "some" yet?
Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy?
Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
He's at a home out here.
You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.
Who is this "he"?
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
Party?  Oh no, I can't go to a party...
You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
Yes--Me--in person!
That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.
What's a toby?
Hey Walter--
Go right over there.
...to me.  I think I'm dying.
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.
No, thank you.
A flack jacket.
No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
I will.
Bingo.
Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --
Wait here.
Oh. Well, yes and no. It wasn't an official call. He's just a friend.  An old, ornery friend.
Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur.
Did I?
What?  Ridden on a horse?
Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
Just a couple of days.  Do you feel up to a visitor?
...gimme some help...
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
That's what he is... Baaaa!
See you in ten years.
Oh.
Aren't you off-duty?
Ts! Ts! Ts!
-- which is a hack.
Get behind him more.
I'm embalming my high school teacher, don't sing.  All right Arthur, just a slide of the needle.....
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
We had us a deal here for nineteen- five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen-five!
We're on foot.  We can't get away.
No, now I can't kill you.
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
At the store. You doin' some good?
Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.
Yes, of course...maybe one hour.
"Carefully".  "Carefully". "Carefully".
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...
The "crises"?
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
No, I need some serious household advice.
Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't told me how we get her back.  Where is she?
Well, shoot! Maybe there was!
You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks.
You've been retained?
Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
...tunnel now!
I already have a very good idea what could've happened...  ...Megan, Jason is out there.  He has to be stopped.  I'm positive he's heading back to the lake area.  He'll keep killing until...
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
I know that.
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
The basic principles of time travel are there.  So you have the vessel and the portal. And the vessel can be anything. Most likely a spacecraft.
I said we'd give you an interview. I never said we wouldn't kill you.
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
We're not?
Yeah.
They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
What night is it?
It's up to you.
Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
No.
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
What?
... You look wonderful...
I don't want to ruin your day.
We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
-- I want that red car -- the girl -- we gotta get lucky here --
Oh.
Oh, are you on the team?
Have you ever been inside?
Our present.
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
Really?  Well, come on, then.
What a body, what a voice.
Just forget about it.
We'll figure something out.
LOUDER!
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
Of course, Nick...
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
He can't even move.
Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
And some rolling papers.
I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
Mm?
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
I'm not married.
Muncie!
If there were a leader, I would be the one.
Let's go with it.
Listen, Baxter, we made you and we can break you.
Maybe.  Who cares?
Who??
Where is that?
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
Don't bullshit me.
It would be a nice change from you.
You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
Kill him! Finish it!
<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
'Code Blue'...
A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.
-- and I'm through playin' games.
Next time try "fat and haggard."
That's the third white van I've seen.
Childs, you got the torch?  You get your ass in here!!
Oh yeah, that's it.
It's more than that.
He's drunk.
She fucked me too.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
I see. Where is this gun?
Your eyesight will return in time.
You mean you've known about him all along? Why didn't you tell me?
Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
Gently, son --
Really?
What's that mean?
Sure.
No problem.
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
Heard that.
That.
An old acquaintance, eh?
We're gonna save you, Noel. You're gonna be all right.  Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking backup, I swear!
I didn't say anything?
Not very late.
I remember. The big tipper.
Later.
You're a silly girl.
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
Ask him.
Norris looked pretty dead, himself. Bullets don't kill these Things.
You didn't drive her mad.
That's okay, Hannah.  It was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies.  Sex - you can learn from movies.  But robberies?  There's no way.
Okay.  Okay.
I'll be alright.
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
Can I help you, Mrs. Argon?
And marriage, does that get easier?
Nothing.  It was just a dream.
No, sir!
The blood transfusion is completed. While Marc himself is looking after the patient, the nurse leads Nikolas into an adjoining room, where she makes him sit down and prepares his bandage. The doctor stands bending over LÃ©one.
Yes, Thelma?
You know what I want, babe?
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
You're a spy.
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
No, a <u>pact</u>.  No money involved.  This is more important than any bet.  Now here's the deal: We all get laid before we graduate.
It's a pleasure.
My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater.
Of course.
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
Yes, isn't he.
Ecru.
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
C'mon.
Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.
Certainly, General.  Why do you ask, sir?
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Four days.  I left to think.
Is her husband sick or something?
I guess.
So?
Come, come, Mr. Stone, you are a little upset. It's not fair to bargain with you now. -- I'll give you until midnight, Mr. Stone, but not one minute more. Ah, then you'll come with me indeed.
They'll never stop.
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
Any idea where it is?
I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details!
Let's see -- how long has it been?
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
How much?
You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
Yes.
She gave me the evil eye.
I'm already way over my usual limit. You know, it's funny. I feel like I've known you for years.
This is my room.
How could you have been so stupid?
I don't know, sir.
Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
Rowan's mother died at childbirth. And she doesn't have. any family.
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
I got a dress, yeah.
Who's this?
Now!
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe...
Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun story. You should hear the way I tell to the guys back home. He had an Uzi. Mike half-smiles.
It's not going to let us out!
To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
Oh God.
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
I don't give a damn about the gold.
Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
I don't know...  Me.
We did it.  We did it.
Okay...It's so good to see you.
We're both in it, Harry.
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
Fairy tales?
Your work.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
Yes.
You don't like my voice...?
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
Where is that?
That's right.
This isn't a comic book store, right.  It's a bakery.
No...not really.
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
Hey, don't worry about it. Your daughter's around. We'll find her in a couple days.
Like what?
Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
-- Waiter.
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
You two have some sick sex thing?
Find it... AND cross it!
...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.
I'm an idiot to have you up there.
Tell me.
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
Who the fuck are you trying to kid? You are that soulless monster.
Maybe I will- one of these days.
She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
You see, that's worse.
Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
You think it's that good?
Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.
Well as it turns out I did.
By the way, if you ever go past the Wyatt ranch, have another talk with Elaine.
Wipin' little circles with his bread...
She's coming with us.
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
I'm afraid.
Hey...
Oh, yeah?  People fall toward a shot, you know...  not back from it.  I knew you were lying.
Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life.
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
I can't even keep fish alive.
We appreciate your position--really.
Gabby, what is it?
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
I'm going back.
What, like it's that hard?
Too right . . . but he doesn't have a show! Nobody gets into Mother's draws except Daddy!
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
Hey--that coffee?  You're a goddess. Gimme, gimme...So what you gals talk about?
Will you come to him on your knees?
Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you -
Nigger, you lie like a big dog.
I have.
Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --
Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
As for instance?
Throw the third switch!
Because I can't bear to watch. When they lose, I die inside. It's like some little person named Steve just crumples up and dies. I wait for the scores. I still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second. I can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning. I've done it too many times. And I can't do it anymore.
If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy.
It isn't?
I believe Q's exact words were:  "Hopefully, nothing."
To arm-twisting.
Yeah? How?
And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
No.
That's pretty cool.
Not lately it isn't.
I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
I haven't got the job yet.
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
All accidents until proven otherwise.
Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then...
I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
Who's they?
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
And now you tell me.
...he did what he was told.
You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
You were good.
No.  It's not.
-- Listen: "November 5, 1980. Cecil Stipe walked into 5th Precinct. Says he witnessed Chin shooting, saw suspect's picture in Post. Says Shu Kai Kim wrong man."
We're not on the pier yet -
I left my forgery kit back at the office.
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
But, but, but, "they" would find out.
Both.
You haven't talked to him.
I suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting Green.
And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?
This is bullshit, man.
Oh God -- I can just imagine -- if only Dickie would settle down... doesn't every parent deserve a grandchild? Never! I swear on your ring, Marge. I am never going back.
You don't like tents, mosquitos, look at your fingernails, you have about as much business being in the woods--
What a BITCH!
But it's true!  You can call him yourself.
Dad --
Come on.  Let me buy you something to eat.  Looks like you could use the company.
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
Very well put.
I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband.  Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me.
He looks after me. He's a gentleman too.
I was the next man.
Why tell me?
Wait...
Oh, me -
Isn't that how it is for everybody?
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
Good! We'll get it to the nearest outlying station and hold it for prints - we're on our way -  You coming?
Three.
Your children?
You haven't told me everything.
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
-- Thanks, coach --
Got it Ben.
Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule?
Are you wearing eye shadow?
Good guess -- but no.
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
Sir...?
Oh, you're gonna love this:
But if they <u>do</u>?
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
What?
That's a long time.
Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here.
Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
Yes.
It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
He wouldn't say.
I'd think about it.
Hey, Chef.
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
Yeah, there is a strange vibe here.
I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
Not for Quincy McCall.
How will that be done, exactly?
This is Alvy Singer!
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
What's wrong?
Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
Why would I need an attorney?
I mean, after that?
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.
He'll tell me when he gets home.
Beats a lawsuit.
You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?
Promise me.
Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
You have to answer for Santino.
Do you always have to repeat?
Yeah?  Yeah, that'd be nice, let me get my coat.
In view of the gentleman's touching concern for the Senators, would he permit a motion to recess until the morning--at which time he could continue to educate this august body with his profound babblings?
And what it that?
And you're working with him?
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
So noted.
Oh.	And huge portable radios. Everything else gets small, but for some reason, portable radios get enormous.
They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that...
Well, I'm not.
You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
You don't know?
Keeping your word is something I can actually respect, Ted.
Oh, my God.
NICK!!!
That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it.
How? What can I do?
What'd you care?
You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.
Don't worry, darlin, I'm...
Yes, Sir.
We thought--
Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
Of course not.
I need the job.
I've been over every foot of it. You couldn't have any idea. You'd have to see for yourself--  --the prairies--the wind leaning on the tall grass--
Well, stay here tonight.
American.  Come to get you out.
Come here a minute.
Oh.
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
The Court gave you justice.
Not at all.
Sure thing.  Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  You can go home.  Gimme til morning.  Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh?  Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,
We still don't know.
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
Oh. What's wrong now?
Typical male.
Go to the Symphony --
What's that mean?!
It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
Maybe it's by the wardrobe boxes...
Captain who?
Uh, huh huh... We'll do it, sir.
Hurry, Rose.
Why don't you two stick to reality.
Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.
She hates all freshmen.
The creek bed --
That's five clicks, Jackson.
We'll double your price.
Do -- do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
Dynamite.
That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
Nothing about the porters yet?
Hellnno, Major.  I was just trying to think the thing through.
...yes...
Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --
No, they won't.
Yeah baby. I think someone did.
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
Don't cry, Amy.
Like do you believe in heaven?
...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
Sure.
It's what?
No you weren't.
What will happen?
I am a very serious gardener.
Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
Yes.
Checking........
Me?
What kind of a life is that?
Hal has it.
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
Not this again --
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
I sincerely hope not.
Well you've got it, warmblood.  Now what the fuck are you gonna do with it?
No, she didn't Claire.  But I think you should do the scene.
Left you?
Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
All right, Jack, all right.
How's the arm?  Still sore?
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
That's right...
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
No, I came because we need -
Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
Git along little dowgie and call me back.
Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
I mean, follow orders, sir.
Separate incidents?
For instance, how to run the affairs of government? No doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me-- with the greatest ease!
Struck out eighteen...
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
That isn't very nice.
No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.
Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up...
Dorsia is...fine.
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
Yes.
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
Shut up!
Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something?
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
Makeup.
Oh that, she just likes to play.
What?  Hey, listen, what-what do you think? Do you think we should, uh, go to that-that party in Southampton tonight?
Me?
'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'
No, I don't.
Sorry, sir.
And Bourne? Where's he now?
The one you're wearing?
'Course not.  Strictly business.
Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
He's not ready yet.
I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place.
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
How did I get in this taxi?!
Shh! Can't talk like that now. You're in ...  You know ...
You look sick if you ask me. I hate to leave you with the dishes and all, but I'm supposed to go to a meeting of the Garden Club this evening.  I'll need the car keys.
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games.
Your husband.
People have been crucified before.
Yeah, I got it.
I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.
With whom? Where?
Just be cool.
With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
So when did Buddy leave?
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
Yes...
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
No, I don't.
We're doing everything we can to find these people. Right Tony?
I could use a lawnmower...
What exactly do you mean?
We'll see.
Madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... "I am delighted to have you here"? I have not reached that stage of civilization.
Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson.  Set up an appointment at four.
How old is he?
Well, I think I_ve got a handle on the Czech pysche and I reckon this kind of joint will make _em reminisce about the sixties. Plus we should get a few stray expat_s looking for Kafka.
That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood.
We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.
Just like the President.
Yes, I did.
Just sleep now, Mom.
Yes.
Oh.  Well, when, then?
In the den.
Damn you!  What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
Couldn't you have appealed to Congress?
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
No way.
I could scoop them out.
But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
No...as a matter of fact...
Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him...
All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
No, sir, we did not.
I forgot to get the Coca-Cola.
I think I could help.  You gonna tell me you don't need help?
Hi.
Right.
If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?
And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
What do you mean?
They shot Donny!
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
I think you look beautiful.
You make my mouth water.
Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
Man, I'd love to have your autograph, Snake.
No I didn't.
No.
In there.
I trusted you.
What?
Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
Look, I'll rush and be there by two, I promise.  Go ahead without me.
Uh, yes, sir.  The Monroe Hotel...
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
Good-bye, look in your backpack.
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
I know how it is.  My Dad collects miniature canon.
Whenever. Tonight.
It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?
Am I attractive?
All right, Doc...
Then think about it.
There's not enough time.
Is there a part for me?
You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
Remember what?
She does.
You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother..
And it's getting dark. I'm not going to run this into the night.  Eddie, we're walking in. Everything covered?
Come inside.
What's your twenty?
Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
Almost three.
No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really --
Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.  Quit kidding around.
Victor did.
You are, Lewis.  You rolling?
Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
Ah, wear whatever you want.
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.
Not a prayer.
What did Albania ever do to us?
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.
We forgot to stop at the store.
We all deserve to wear white.
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
He fell out.
Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry too --
I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
Have you?
Six month stint on Datus.
George, are we gonna do this or not?
Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my <u>species</u>.
Little late for that.
Okay.
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
Did you get it?
...the river.
Alice... I...
Will it change your wife?
We don't know that for sure.
Let's hope it holds.
We're getting a little old for running.
I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.
I'm glad you like it, Mr. Gardiner.
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do.
Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang. But we're running low on the other.
They're only gonna lose.
And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
That would be okay.
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
Always.
Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry?
Where is he now?
Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
I don't ... have them.  Mother ... I swear, I ... didn't smoke.
What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...
Just like the day of the auditions, right?  Jesus.  How's my hair?
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
That's stupid. Why would they?
Probably.  What movie is this?
I love you.
If I weren't married?
He owes me money.
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Oooo.
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
What do you want me to do about it?
But I want you to do it, I want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody I can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything.
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
Only one you've never broken.
It has nothing to do with you.
It's the rough-cut, the other side's new commercial.
If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
Starling -
That's so.
Here's his head.
Oh, shit.
Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.
You look like you lost your sheep ...
This is my house.
He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
Did they find the guy who broke into the office yet?
I never hear the whistle.
Terrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week.
Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
That's because they've only seen it once.  But I'll do it again, and again, and AGAIN...  They'll catch on!
Well.... er...
Get ready to go.
Yes, please.
He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
Kitty...
It's called the Law of Love, asshole.
Let's get some armor on her, and the we'll get outa this stinkin bug hole !

Do you remember a Miss Simms?
I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...
It's all a big game isn't it?  A sick, fuckin' game.  I don't know if there's two of you involved, or what -- but we're going to find out.  Last night you gave us just enough to send us to the wrong place.  It must've shocked the hell out to you when Frank walked in on Pine Road and you couldn't finish.
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
You don't fear death?
You wish.
What?
I don't want it to go away.
He's your cousin.
Paranoiac!
Christy was nice...
He's not going tonight.
I didn't have the time.
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
There you go with that we again.
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
And this Mr. Hank Aleno who you talk so much about, a renowned failure, who also happens to be so conveniently dead -- perhaps the "man" you claim helped invent Simone is an invention himself?
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
So she hasn't changed?
I don't like waiting.
They can't shoot us in here.
Why did you, then?
No -- this is wasting time.
Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
Richard, take it easy.
Eggs.
Margie Olmstead?
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
Joey...look at me...
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
Where does he go?
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
A coke, if they have it?
If you went down on a horse... You'd tell me, right?
I wish you luck, sir.
The police always do, don't they?
Could this be him?
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Go through with what?
More than you think.
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
Sure.
Jonas?
You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.
It's alright.  I know what you mean. Let's start at the top.
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
And a car.
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
You always want to run everything.
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
You're so gross.
Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
Him?
So do I.
Last night, after you'd gone, I did a little bit of asking around. Seeing as you weren't very forthcoming,  It seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother?  I got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke I wanted off my back,  You know my life. Machines. The arcades. Nice business. Looks after itself. People put money in. I take it out. Not much rough stuff. It's a business that makes me very happy. But recently, I've had a spot of bother,  One of my lads gets a bit over- anxious and flogs some machines in a club that's already got some. The upshot is I've had to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs.  So far as I'm concerned, that's it. Apparently not. These people I've offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit,  So I'm worried. I can't fight them - I haven't that kind of set-up. But I've got to fix them before they fix me. Trouble is, if I try and they find out, I'm dead.
Where are you from, boy?
So long, Father.
No.
I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
Yes.
Yes I do.
Okay.
Look!
What're you talkin' about?
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
I'll do it tomorrow.
Sure. By shooting at me.
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
You'll be able to throw it further than I could.
That's nice. What'd you tell him?
Something like that.
Excellent.
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
I don't think so.
Well, can we make it one more.  Nowhere the fuck near me.
Clean.
I feel really on the spot now.
She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
Hey, Tim.
He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
Oh, hey Vijay.
Try and live a lifetime before Friday. Cram it all in.
Come on...
I've got him.  The guy in the turban.
If he doesn't shut up...
Captain, I don't know how much longer I can hold her together!
I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
I thought it might begin the healing process.
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
Wait a minute.  You're my wife?
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
My secretary.
...no...
No.  That's okay.
About where you're from.
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
I'm not going to Vegas.
You got no choice. It's over.
What?
What about you, Everett? What'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place?
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
Yeah, yeah.  She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane.
Are you neglecting my request?
Why's that?
Why can't you do it?
I thought maybe-uh-"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
....I dunn...o....maybe ten...five, fuck, fuck....that's another thing that goes --
I thought you wanted to.
OK.
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
You're pretty.
What?
Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?
Oh yeah.
In the truck.  I'll get it.
What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
Where's that?
Theoretically, yeah , but we've never shut down the whole system.  It may not come back at all.
No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
Do me a favor, will you?
It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.
I'm a bowler.
Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
Nothing.  It's just not there.
Luck! You fightin' a crazy man -- but you got him hurt bad.  More ice, now!
We keep them.
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
Ah! Let us begin!
We should be fine, then.
All right.
How do you know?
Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
But maybe it's not what you think.
It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
I think I'll take the stairs.
It's when you say, "Everybody else cheats why shouldn't I?"  But I don't -- I don't <u>hate</u> -- him. I... loved him once, Joey.  Very much.  I just got... tired.  Maybe it wasn't all his fault.  He... What's happening?  Oh, my God...
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it?
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
Is it cold?
No.
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
Yah, okay, but, uh -
Of course not.  I told him I was going to visit a great aunt.  And don't tell Larry, either.
Hold up.
Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
Alright, asshole.
I don't know.
I like talking about it.  At least, to you.
How's that?
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
Except fall down like a normal person.
Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
No.
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?
For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
Can't you get the money from your friends?
Beyond the stream.  I think I know.
Your foot! Give me your foot!!
Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
What do you mean?
Yes?
Say what you're gonna say.
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
Uh-huh.
Are you going to kill us?
No, I haven't.
You've got the schematics, check.
I'm hungry.
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
Over and out!
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
Get out.  Out!
But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
Part of him is.
You too, 'Mam.
How?
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
You have to be experienced to do this. Just wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him.
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
Did you play ARCADE last night?
What time is it?
Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I.
But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
Well, it is simple. It's all in the thumb, see? A lot of people do it-
I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!
What was the problem?
I said back away.
Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!
What happened!
I think he's jealous of Havel.
Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
Describe him.
No, Louis!  No!
Can't do it with both hands?
Now how the hell can I help you?
We're in the Bronx, my man. Hundred and Sixty First Street.
You can't run with suitcases.
That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.
Go ahead. Stun me.
That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
We can finally consign my old bird to the scrapheap. AlmÃ¡sy smiles and walks on towards the others.
You are?!
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
Something like that.
I'm sorry.
Someone bet me a dollar ..
Can you prove it isn't?
The Sistine Chapel?
Oh, sorry I spoke.
I guess that means it's okay.
It came from across the lake.
Who is it you wish to see, sir?
No, sir!
You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do.
Crash, I didn't think you--
Anyone?
I am their hero!
Your buddy is callin' ya.
See them two big trees across there?
And fifty bucks a lead.
My honor, that's what I'm fighting over.  Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
He don't know that. I didn't.
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
Survive today, that's the point.
As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
Have you talked to the doctors at all?
...I was <u>working</u>...
Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...
What's April 16th?
Hard to miss.
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
My name's Scott Roper.
Then who did?
That's not what I meant.
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now.
I thought not.  I noticed you by yourself, all night.
Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories - I'm sick of this sort of thing.
Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
Alright.  Let's...  Page five, the fucking <u>horse</u> dies.  You know, <u>she</u> could be in the movie, she could, she's got a good face, she could be the Doctor's...uh, why does it have to be his, uh, <u>wife</u>...?  It could be his...
Yes he is.
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
Viewer, standard ahead.
Fuck it.
You too.  Good luck!
He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
-- yes, George.
Pam Grier.
I'm supposed to be at my old man's for Christmas dinner at eight.
Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?
Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!
How do you know this?
Give it back to him.
How quaint. But I can go any place you can.
We're finished.
Yeah?
Consider me gone, Detective --
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
Maybe you can be his stand-in.
Then why am I here?
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
If not for you I never would've made it. You know that. My own parents couldn't have...  ... The boy, Alfred. You'll both be provided for. Don't let all this got to waste.
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
It could have been a tape.  A prerecorded conversation between Sanderson and himself.
No. I never feel like that.
I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
Yes, sir.
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.
... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
Me?
It's anti-nature.
Smoking or non-smoking?
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.
This looks promising...
And you didn't jump of your free will?
No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
My name is Ronald Brean.
That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
How's the beautiful lady?
Cancer-sucker.
They did not!
Positive.
Take a left and your next right.
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the mind I can control.  Alright, let's do it.
You listen to the feelings, not the words.
Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
Sometimes I do.
We're not actually talking about it.
This gentleman can have my room.
Where...?
She told me she killed them.
I told them we invaded England.
Yes?
I love your script.
'Course I was right. About what?
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
Yeah, you're probably right.
Excuse me?
No.  I'm not going near him.
I told you I was gonna hit you.
No, I guess not. It was pretty lousy of me, I guess, to be a child at the same time you were. Not to stop being a child just because I had a child. I guess I was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up.
The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
I know exactly what you mean.
Have a security team meet me at Deck Four main elevator!
Nothing...
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
I understand General, but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be rewarded.
Hairy women are kind of sexy. Women in their natural state.
Uh-huh.
But I'm hideous!
Can I talk to Hearst?
For a man in my position --
Ambrose. I know.
Dick.
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage.
That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
Write down Drexl's address.
It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.
A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
She's Cuban.
I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
Would you knock it off, Sam?
And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.
No!
Yeah. It'll be nice. It'll be a change of pace. That club shit gets boring.
This one came unassembled.
Jack Carter.
The fish?
Hello.
Can you meet me and Sartorius on B deck in an hour?
Then marry Ralph ... you'll be the happiest couple in the world.
Same time, same place.
A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
It's Amy Kramer.
Mmm.
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
Good.
Thank God.
Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
What else is new?
Don't be so supportive, honey.
That could be anybody's.
Apparently he has the letters.
Pinned? What does that mean?
She got married last month.
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
Well no -- not exactly -- but --
But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in  --
Who? A scab?
Jesus!
I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again,  I'll f-, I'll f-
You're going to settle out of court?
What kinda beer do you like?
Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such a... Thank you.
It's Friday the 13th.
Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
I'll pay you another visit, with a share of the profits, once its sold.
Nope.
I never kid.  My wife hates it.  Says I'm too serious.
So tell me, Cameron, what on earth -- just tell me, because I want to know -- what on earth could make you think that we would want to share a flat like this with someone like you?
You know what? I...
What did you say that for, Sarah?
I don't believe it is, no.
Yeah?
Where?
Alright.
How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back.
Excuse me?
I'll get it annulled.
I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
It was busy.
I'M going. You are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. Meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
Plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night...
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?
I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad to.
Hey Murph.
That's what I'm thinkin'...
You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
Oh my.
How low?
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
I'm gonna pee. You want anything?
I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
That's right.
Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?
Thanks for the tip, Johns.
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
You disappointed in me?
Would you desert your friends?
He will be here.
Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia.
It was my fault.  I slipped.
Yeah?
If he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working on it here.
Maintaining course. Straight for Mustang.
Sixty-nine cent.
A night on the town instead of under it?
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
Hi, Han... Chewie.
Yeah.
Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
Listen to the water... the river keeps goin' down then rising again.
No.  I feel something.
Look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter.  I'll do one.  My five favorite from the old days at the Dodger.
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
What is it?
Mm, what a waste of Silicone.  What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.
Once...
That's right. You just act like one.
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
Wrenches.  My dad's gonna love that one.
No, just the...there's no witnesses, right...?
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
Just wondering.
I live here.
Do it, goddammit!
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
Irena.
So something please Doctor, Help her!
I don't know.  He took it hard.
Probably all the other families will line up against us.  But, it's alright.  These things have to happen once every ten years or so...gets rid of the bad blood. You gotta stop 'em at the beginning. Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at Munich, they shoulda never let him get away with that, they were just asking for big trouble...
You don't know me at all.
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
No rust?
Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
<Me>?
What?
No thanks.
What did Tommy say?
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
Briefs.
Leon hung himself...
See you tomorrow, maybe.
Yeah.
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
Yeah, well, he's...
I'll go straight to Carver if I have to.  He'll either back me up or accept my resignation.
No way.
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
Put your shoulders back, I said.
You've been watching the film.
How's the ice break?
To the best of my recollection, Mr. Bond, I suggested no such thing.  In fact, I was never here.
Now, here's a babe!
I don't know ...  Maybe because you've never needed my help.
I ain't -- got -- you.
You're done, come down, and let's...
'Til they pick up the perp.  Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.
You know. The finger.
Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
I don't know...
Have you succeeded in your task?
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
I guess so.
But I'm afraid of water, so that's been holding my career back a little bit.
She was just too young for you.
This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
And <u>if</u> you never won an Oscar, How'd you like an ambassadorship...
Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate.
Don't.
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
You got more than one?
But John hasn't got any.
I don't know...you got what we need?
Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
What kind of a car is it?
I figured that out.
I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
No, I don't think so...
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
They already know it's you.
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
He sure did.
Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
And you're beautiful...
Yeah, a man's drink...
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
Well, I win sometimes.
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
So it's on the street.
Tony.
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
But it wasn't him... she was after a huge guy, six foot four with a broken nose. She said he looked just like a boxer. Speaking of sandwiches... I think Bobby was arranging something for you...  Speaking of arrangements...  SPEAKING OF ARRANGEMENTS... Why don't you two come up to the cabin this week? Leo and I know that Santy Claus is coming to town... Thursday.
Tell me about its sexual roots.
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
What?! No, no. You can't--
But you can't...you.
What's your name, lover.
Monica!
On your sleeve.
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
As long as there isn't a fire hydrant.  What I've gone through --
As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.
It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk.
Got it.
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
I never knew you smoked.
What happens in tow and a half hours?
Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant.
We can't.
I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.
I'll quit, maybe you should start.
Jeffrey nothing.
That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
But, Lily--
Gave all that up.  Going into business.
Journalism lesson number one.  If you fabricate your facts, you get fired.
Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
Won't I ever see you again?
I do.  More than anything.  But I am also a realist.  Soon this... what is your charming term -- ?  Dog and pony show will finally be over, and I will go home.
Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do.  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary.
DO YOU SEE TEEM?
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
That's good, Pete. Hey... I want you to talk to a friend of mine.
Twenty-six months.
In my house, you watch that lip...
No. One of us is enough.
Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows...
Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
Did you know he's already got a bad knee? In another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair.
Good for you. Congratulations.
With lots of ketchup?
I know!
We had nothing to do with that riot. That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --
Is it? Is it really?
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.
'That right? Good for you.
You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
That's... terrific!  But I got something better.  This is BIG...  You are getting a once-in-a- lifetime, unbelievably lucrative opportunity to star on... a PRIMETIME NETWORK SITCOM!!!!
Yeah, sure.
I don't get it.
Maybe you mistyped the name when you were saving it. We'll try combinations of those letters...
Then a little nap--
I've got to go.
What, the heat here?
Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
Good.
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
What deal?
I'm glad we didn't.
Didn't mean nothin'.
Brooklyn.
The day you got me out of jail?
My own father...
Why did you build this whole place ?
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?
Frost.
And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
I would say so.
Every day.  More and more.
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.
It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
How much can you bench?
Mr. Lipnik, please -
How dare you speak to me like that? I'm the Princess!
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
Can I help you?
Anybody else need anything read?
It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
Yes?
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
What did you ask me?
How much is your soul worth if you don't?
Not on your life.  That's it. I've had it with crap around this house.  From now on, no more pizza!  Get it?  Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!
A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing...
At least I haven't been barking up the wrong tree.
Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little green men, first landed here millions of years ago. Those that didn't leave have been laying dormant underground since the last Ice Age. In the form of an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet. Using us as hosts. Against this we have no defense. Nothing but a weak vaccine.  Do you see why it was kept secret? Why even the best men -- men like your father -- could not let the truth be known?
Now what did you lose?
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
I see.
I'm sure it won't be long now.
Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
Same here. But I had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon. You know, to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture, and he said it would be okay.
What else?
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
No, I'm fine, thanks.
Not in this case. CHARLIE  You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
What are you talking about?
Was that supposed to make me feel better?

Piano.  Guy got away, disappeared into Toontown.  Nobody ever saw him again.
Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU.
I've got a whole backpack full of clothes!
Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.
Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
What did you think?
Fences are failing, all over the park!  A few minor systems, he said!
The engines are fixed.
Ring the call to quorum.
Andy.  Another fuckin'...
But you didn't have to come up here.
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
For a ride.
Not ever?
I like it up here.
I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry?  Thanks for the drink, boys.
I brought these walnuts to trade.
They're with 'em -- if they're still alive.
You humans are very curious to us. You invite us to live among you, in an atmosphere of equality we've never known before.  You lay before us a beautiful green world, full of freedoms and opportunities... You give us ownership of our lives for the first time... and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves: to live by the rules... rules that aren't made to keep one people subordinate to another, but rules that exist to preserve equality.  You aspire to very high ideals here.
He'll die -- !
I love you dad.
I sure hope so.
He's with his friends.
We'll hunt him down together...
Hurray!
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
Both would be nice.
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this - believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I - I'm sorry - listen, how are you - I'm sorry. You doing okay?
Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.
Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.
I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.
Tomorrow morning.
Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
Two years.  George, I can't wait that long.
A fog bank.
They won't believe us.
She'd punish me.
Look.
Nothin'.  They gotta be outa there early.  I'm gonna bust that bastard in one play.
No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
A job?
We'll save you a place at our table.
What?
I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
Maybe you shoulda killed him.
The soldiers are going to kill those people!
You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.
For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
Hey, just tell me where the fuck you want us to go.
Then why did you come here?
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
Kill me if you will, but I can't do this...
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
The CRM-114 is smashed, right?
With the proper tools, Conor, a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one.
Uch. Shut up, Dean.
No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Whadda ya think?
That was my king!
There's nothing. I'm coming down.
Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... Victoria?
Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
What's Nels' number?
At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.
Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side?
They're friends of mine.
Are these all the subjects?
It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it?
But a virus normally codes for other viruses.  This one's making human and animal proteins.  Listen to this.  "Glycotetraglycine collagenoid. Weinstein's tropic hormone.  4- monoxytocin supressin hormone."
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Didn't you tell her?
We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.
Beats me.
Nope.
Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.
It's a sin to be fat.
Oh, the boy has a mouth, now if only he had an arm.
Yes, you can make sandwiches....
Maybe, yes... maybe no.
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
Cornelius..
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
He does work hard.
I won't....
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
No.
Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
Up, up, up.
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
It's a great song.
Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.
Look, Jerry, you're not sellin' me a damn car. It's my show here.  That's that.
Sure you're all right?
I don't have another cat!
Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some- thing I ought to tell you.  My... ah, situation has...changed.  I lost my job.
I'm just playing around.
Nick, please, it's me --
White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park. Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back...
I don't think that's such a good idea.
He wasn't.
How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months?
What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
The keys are in the kitchen.
Anything good?
John, where are we g --
They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
Miles.
We're good to loan in.
Take your fucking goldfish, too!
My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw...
I have a feeling I'm about to start buying my own.
Who'd want to?
So's my Johnson.
Give me 20 minutes at least.
Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.
Not like Matt, you mean.
Are you serious?
Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that.
You have the wrong house.
No.  There's more.  There were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat.
Yeah, I know.
No you didn't.  You didn't even ask about Billy.
Rath.  Robert Rath.
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
Also heard that you passed on that little job in Libya.
Let's go.
Do you think they have a room here?
...ready before the morning crowd blows in.
My name is Donnie Smith and I have lot's of love to give.
You should be happy.  What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket.
Don't start.
A piece.  Only a piece.
Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
What -- ?
No sir.
Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic.
Impossible.
To make sure she's all right.
Everyone needs a change of scenery. I've been rolling down these halls for forty-odd years.  That's quite enough.
What'chu sayin'?
Yes, he did.
Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
Someone should hurt them.
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --
Wasn't no bullet.
I think not.  I have, of course, taken the precaution of wiring the briefcase to explode five seconds after it opens.  Unless, of course, I deactivate it before it goes off.
Yes.
Did you grow up around here?
We all know you're gonna get over with the insurance money anyway! Ya know da deal.
Starck...
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Thank you.
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
I talked to him.
Yes.
Whatever it is.  GO <u>do</u> it.  How you doing on the permit?
Not long.
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
Yes?
Am I home?
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
I guess they do.
No, no, no...
They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  What do you think about that?
How?
Let's get you out of here. Come stay with me until you get your strength back.  Free electrolysis, if you want it! We'll get that face of yours cleared up in no time.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
...Rene...
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
Oh that's nice for you.
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
What is it, 97 days?
More wine!!
Well, I am working on my thesis.
Your life flashing before your eyes?
A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
Just a minute.
Oh, I don't ...
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
Absurd!  All this fuss over a snip of a girl.  I'm going down to see her myself.
That and a fat, new contract.
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France?
All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
Any particular kind?
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
How does he breathe?
I'm going home.
I don't understand.
Karl Childers just in from the state facility. Make one of them gruntin' sounds Karl or whatever it is you do.  Oh well, Karl's a little retarded, he don't know what the hell I'm talkin' about. And to Vaughan who fucks a mortician in the rear entrance right in front of his clients. Now that takes balls. Our number one tune for the folks, boys. Kick it off Johnson!
Fuck you!
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
That will take time.
Hugo.
Well it's just kind of a coincidence, isn't it?  Stanton and Fleming, both started in '83, both in area six...both in Vice?
It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?
...you.
On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
Not yet.
But how in God's name ...
I know...
Yeah. You must come again.
Huh?

Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?
I just thought we should talk about it.  Between ourselves.
What do you mean?
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
Beg pardon?
Yes.

Like what?
Hackers of the World, Unite!
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
The best explanation is always the simplest one. Let's wait. Let's wait and see. In the meantime try not to worry.
You found him -- but we're not open yet.
Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?
And you didn't try to find out who?
How can you kill him like that?
Just like you'd think. But he's not going to run. We're sticking to our plan. Now we both need help.
When you get outta that school, you come right on back home, y'all gon' have to take this laundry work I done for Miss Boatwright today.
You're a fuck, Walter!
Nope.
Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
Beautiful.
I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You are good to me - you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful...
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
Well, just promise me you'll be careful... alright, alright see ya soon... good-bye.
Come over here.
Promoting that action movie I did...
Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster!
Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
Since when did you care about paperwork?
Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves.
I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
I haven't seen her in almost two years.
Listen, it's late already when I realize it's not just a couple of ordinary faggots, it's just you and Sal.  I couldn't get a baby sitter.
You know who I am?
No.
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!
You would still have planted information that Clarendon knew about the gun--and not as an accusation, but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession.  Very neat.  Good morning, Mrs. West.
Help me with two minutes of silence!
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
But what about all these other people?
Fries?
Me? No. Not really.
But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either!
--it's urgent!
I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming.  And I'm gonna steal your life away.  You went down 30 years ago.  You just don't know it yet.
I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
Go get your stuff.
Yes.
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
I know that Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a gun and not to have it.
Near the In-and-Out Burger--
I thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or something. Is that single- spaced?
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
You're sure about this?
He sure as hell won't.
That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
Like what?
Yep.  He really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  Musta gone 450 feet...damn...
It's early yet.
Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
No -- it's --
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
Yeah ...
How well are you trained in music?
Stop it...
Sure.  Sure.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
You're some fucking jerk.
Well good.  Thank God.
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...
That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
I'm sure you kept warm.
No.
Ask away, Major.
We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
Miss Kubelik --  -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch.
Bastard!  Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks.
I wish I knew. Uhura?
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.
And Honest Abe's ideals. A rare man-- these days.
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
I haven't the slightest idea.
Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles.
I can't.  I can't go on.  I can't keep lying...killing.  That's not me.  That's not US.
Swiss.
Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
We missed him.
Feel anything?
I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
What's her name?
Tramp! Beautiful!
Does she know where she's going?
Please don't do anything crazy.
Hey, kid.
What stuff is that?
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
Like what?
Why not?
This can't be.
Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
Nope.
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
Well, I've had it up to my ass with sedate!  You said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. Well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!
Yes, I guess.  Yes.
It sure is....
I want to know you.
Go.
Really?
We're not supposed to think about it.  But I dream about it sometimes...
I am the future.  I am all colors.  All races.  All creeds.  I am the melting pot.  I am the tossed salad.  I am post racial.
Fuck you.
You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
Yeah, she's here.
Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
Tea... or whiskey?
She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand.  The CIA, the Mafia, the Wall Street bastards ...
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
And how long have you been a dentist?
"Intra-Agency fraternizing."
Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
I don't have to say that.
Don't guess. Just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you I'm heading East.
And I say she won't! I'll not have the scorn of God on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the Sabbath!  And as for you -- let me tell you, young woman...!
Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.  Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?
You're making my life difficult.
Correct. Now the train leaves--
It is beautiful.
I'm backing up.
Yes.
Uh, huh?
Give it to me!
Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...? They must see what the legacy has wrought - Diedre, withered inside herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood...  surely they sense the child you carry - and the life it might lead in Lashers grasp...   Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life...?!
I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.
Don't <u>even</u> talk about that stuff!
Could.
I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
Not with this disk. I'm going to check on the beam connection, Yori. You two can keep a watch out for grid bugs.
Home it is.
Be quiet and listen.
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--
Of course.
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one I'd given you and then got back, remember? I can't find it. Do you know where it is?
She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
You haven't told him?
It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
You changed the room around...
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Seattle.
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
Did you do anything?
What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
Forget it, the point is, everybody has nightmares once in a while. No biggy.
Yes.  And a much nicer one than ours.
That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
Hmm?
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
How about, he sees her on the street, he wipes the soot from his eyes.  He goes up to her.  "What happened to the horse?" She looks at him.  She takes his hand...
Fine.
What about you? Where are you going?
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
I don't think I'm going.
That's your problem, man. You can't see what you've got, only what you've lost. Those guys are right. You are "money".
I didn't expect you back so soon.
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
It's a little late for that.
Well, these... women friends of yours... all over the world. How does it work? Do you see some of them again? Do you forget others? Do you write them now and then? How do you manage it?
You said you wanted these.
Fuck no!  But there's a poster.
That sounds great!
That's quite a statement.
Betty would never dress like that. She's not some trailer park slut!
Not in front of the boy.
Where is your attacker?
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
At the party.
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.
I don't like to see you go.
Uh... yeah. Yeah. She's uh... watchin' over the little ones.
What are you doing here?
Thank you.
Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.
You're not mad at me?
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
I don't know!
Traps shut!
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
Oh...yeah, I didn't see the accident.
You got something to say --
He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
Why would someone do that?
V'ger is that which programmed me.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
That's-
Say what?
We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
You must never know her name.  If more than one approaches, she will certainly kill them. Alone I may have a chance.
You sure looked it. Something go wrong?
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
What do you want to know?
So are you!
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
They left an hour ago.  You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on.  How soon can you get back to the city?
So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address.
White Russian, thanks.  How's the smut business, Jackie?
Even in Berlin.
I don't think I was.
I love you.
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
I don't know, why?
No one. I promise.
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
I've got a way with people.
Come on in, Betty,
People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood.  It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...
Technical responsibility, real responsibility -- what difference does it make?  Jessica lives -- or she dies. That's what we're talking about!
You really are stupid, you know that.
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
Oh, I thought you would know, you're a writer. Of course you do. Good night, old man.
Yes sir.
They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
It's perfect.
What are you talking about?
I want to come back.
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
What the hell is that?
Yeah.
Sleeping.
Burgel doesn't like anybody!
Yeah I know. You're smart Judge. You ain't no bourgeois nigger like those Paper Panthers across the bay. I need every good man to help us with the security on Betty Shabazz, particularly soldiers. You do solid on that I might have something else for you, something real important.
This morning.
What happened?
I gave her my word, Warner.
To the asylum?
I thought the movie was bitchin'.
And before here?
I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.
"I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."
Come on!
Turn on CNN.
She wouldn't tell me.
Hardly new news.
Liar!
Antonio, the choir...
That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
But how -- how long--?
Cut it out.
Go away. Who are you --?
Zira....
Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
Did you tell Joe to behave?
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
Stop complaining.
I never knowed they was anything like her!
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
Take some allergy medicine.
Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
Like you?
I heard your playing.
Why-

No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
No -- after you.
I'm supposed to always be alone?
Got it...
Sailor?
Oh, good.
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
Shut it, Teddy.
For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing.  Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?
Kip... I -
What'd you say?
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that?
So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?
I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect.
Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
What did you do while the sergeant was killing your son?
I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop.
I am the government.
A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.
That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
This whole thing is a joke!
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
Something you did?
You want us strapped, don't you?
A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.
Oh, no, man. I can't.
Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't make you feel better. You want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... And the theft, is what you want to do!  Sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you'll stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up. How about that?
I want you to settle on their terms.
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
Better living through electricity.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
You got something to hide?
When you're desperate for money, you do a lot of things, Mr. Connell. He's our man, I tell you.
Yeah. Good bye.
You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there...  and you decide that you will die for them... Only then do they start coming out.  They come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... If it's sincere.  If it's pure... They will be with you and take you away forever.
Sshhh! He's in there.
Yes, but we're divorced.
Maybe it's not connected yet.
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
No. She's gone.
The little creep hates it that Eric actually does what the company hired him to do.
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
What??!?
No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
I don't like to give up.
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
No way!
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
Uh-huh.
Totally groovy huh?
Weiss.
Feel like the dog's dinner.
You think he's not good enough for her?  You're right.  If she was my mother, I'd send her home right now.
Yeah. I guess we did.
....this is your mistake....
No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
Where in government?
Okay.
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
Yes.
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.
I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
The time came, you shot him.  But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand.  You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down.  But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?
Enjoying yourself?
And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead man who wasn't really dead until Davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut.
He's on the other side of the river.
That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
Well how did it happen?
I brought Johana to meet you.
They're just cops.  Stall them as long as you can.
Well, I'll be a son-of-a-bitch...
Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting.
No.  If he's lost somewhere in the house... he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over.  What we have to do now is be together, with Nell.
They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
Yes.
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
My child you are the only survivor.
It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
Maybe I already have.
He is...  You sat in that coffee shop across from school--
He is already on the plane.  I hope you will treat him with the same respect you have shown me.
Oh... thank you.
In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?
Here's what I want you to do.
Cut it out, will ya...
No.
I'm carrying quite a large sum in Travelers checks. How much of a deposit would you like?
Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line.
Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
It's on National television, Barnett.
What do you think happened?
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
Need any help?
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
I -- I think so!
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
What?
Well, call General McAddie.
I say... if the Horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our people, he's solid enough to feel this...
Am I... am I dead?
Me and the muse, of course.  How is your book coming along?
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries.
Okay.
Yah. Where are ya, Margie?
Got enough, thanks. We're lookin' for a place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin' - get somethin' to eat, too. Anything like that around here?
Yeah.
Behold!
I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
No shit? Dick, that's great!
I'll handle that later.
Looks great.  It does.
I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
Right.
NO!, He's fine.  Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish.
Can I watch?
No way! He just called him a dick.
We won.
Shut up! Save your stories. The only thing I want to hear is you begging for your life. I want to see you suffer, like they did.  Haha! You're scared now, eh? Come on. Where's the scary monster now huh? Ha ha... We'll see who -
What can we do' mate?
No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother.  You'll like her.
Figure they split?
How many times we been over this, Laz? How many times?
I have to tell you something...
Uh-huh. You could've waited for me inside.
I... um...
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
How should I be ... arrogant?
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
You want to talk about it?
Then don't complain.
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
I guess not.
Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
Hmmmph.
Where do you hail from?
Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
But I might not have.
Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
I never agreed to that.
Tide doesn't turn for three hours.
You're hired!
See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.

I don't want to hurt you, Catwoman. Yet.  After tomorrow, you can do anything you want, but please, just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours. I won't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you. I warn you, don't tempt Captain God when he is angry. Let is complete our mission in peace.
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
My secret?
Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job?
As you wish.
Hey... HEY!    Cool down, Jumbo!
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
Freylag's stronghold?
Way to go, Evy.
Sounds fair enough.
Pardon?
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
Thank you, Master.
Why?
I want to have children.  It's just...
Wade's here.
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey.  ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.
On your ear, you've got something.
No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice for a change.
Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?
What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
Our destruction?  Who?
Oh.
How many?
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
Okay.
Yeah... I know.
Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors sitting down front?  What an ideal couple.
Your cell.  Your room.
You know how people talk.
Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge?
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
Look at me.
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
Who did?
Ah, yes, which reminds me, who here thinks they'd wake up if somebody snuck into their room and started sniffing between their legs?
Yes...
Yeah, I know, but somehow I expect that from her, I mean, she'll do it with almost anybody, I don't know, I shouldn't stick up for her I guess, but him. He lied so... deeply!! Ooo, I want to watch him die!!
Got it hurt in a dynamite blast, son. The dirty dogs had no more use for me, so they let me have time off my sentence, and let me come home.
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
And you were obeying or disobeying orders the night you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
Don't do this.
It's just a trifle, of course.
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
You need to get better first Trevor. Way better.  It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay?
Don't you?
Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.
You do? Okay. Go down aisle A. We've got the best costumes in the whole town.
We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
I'm not implying. I'm quoting. More vested interests...  "Persons Who Will Profit From This Merger...  Ms. Helen Caperelli, General Counsel of CBS News, 3.9 million. Mr. Eric Kluster, President of CBS News, 1.4 million..."
You think I got it?
Not yet.
Bullshit! Bullshit!
Please! And don't look at me.
I'm going to the senior dance.
Think about it.  How do you think I got in here?  Did you hear any glass break?  Did you hear a door splinter?  How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  Is that what happened?
What?
If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.
Always on my ass, anyway.
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
I can't...
Yeah, kind of.
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
I can't. After the show.
No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing.
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
A sign on him?
Really?
It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.
Uh... at least fifty.
The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?
What would you do...?
Give him time.
I've never heard of a cure.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
This by this...
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
That's good.
Yeah.
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
Will they give him a trial?
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
Nah.
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
If I had a man waiting for me for half an hour and whom I hadn't seen for a month ...
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
Thanks, Patrick.
Well, I really don't smoke.
Or what?  You'll have me fired?
We don't have 1.2 hours.
I hated her.
She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.
Damn right.
Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?
That creature sure must have considered it important... using his last strength to draw it...
You've missed this bit.
Thank you... Have you any news?
I noticed.
They sell tickets to an impeachment. Like a fucking circus ... Okay, so they impeach me.  Then it's a question of mathematics.  How many votes do we have in the Senate?
Allez, allez!
What?
I don't think she willed it to me out of sentiment.  She didn't even know who I was.  It's just... tradition.
I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
Dr. Lecter...
Nothing personal.
No.  Of course he lives there. Would I point it out to you if he didn't?
Yes.

So, what do I look like?
He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth than Virginia.  And, what in hell has he done for our cause?  Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise!  Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party!  That's why New England loves him.
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
Yup.
Now I need you to count your money.
A little less than yesterday.
You gonna drive out there?
You want some company?
John.
You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
I don't think so, thank you...
Like... where are you from?
Of course.
The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
Are you sleeping with her? Come, come, Mr. Gittes. You don't have to think about that to remember, do you?
So why don't you just ask him for the money?
Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
You're going to let them get away with this?
The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
Hello, George.
I don't know.  I'm happy.
No, never.
Look, why don't you just call Diane again?
Any time, sailor.
I don't know.  We may never know, but I'm going to guess it was a job, maybe the Karpoli family.
To calm your anxiety.
Oh.
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Did you have to tell her my name?
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
I don't know.
He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that-
No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs.
Payne.
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
Oh.
Jus some girlie things for the squad.
I know.
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
I don't know.  A lot.
Well I'm certain Doctor Spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me.
...if we don't get out of this tunnel!
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
Sir, yes, sir!
Me!
Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
See?  No code.  What'd I say?
I will join my grandfather there.
Just hold up a second, Captain -- I'll get to you soon enough -- We've got things to do here.
I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed.
You think I'd let him run loose without a chaperone? Blade ferrets their rat-holes out, I map them. Then we blow them all to kingdom come.
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
What?  What?
You planned this --
Now, Mr. Hawkins, when last in Amarillo, where did you get gas?
No.
Grace...
She said I could pick any girl I want.
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
He just needs some clothes?
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
What I know is what I told you.
Right here.
Exceeding fair.
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials.  Oh you know that?
Kidnapped? By who?
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
[He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.]
Try again.
Not true.
If they're not busted now, they're gonna be.  It's wide open.
Was Granma bad?
Yes.
Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper.
No.
I... I...
Who are you?
I know.
Which one's the Colonel's?
Me, too.
So I'll talk to him about it.
I fear she's lost.
Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
I wish she hadn't.
Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?
I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
Have we?
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
You're compulsive.
Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
That's okay... doesn't matter.
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
I need a ride out of here.
And get rid of the dog.
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?
Take him down.  Save Richard Yip, our witness...
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
I was talking about us. Working together.
But he's dead.
Where's Ian?
No it's not okay. It's not.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
Are you a good cop, John?
It's a place to live, that's all.
Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough?  And keep your meat hooks off my radio.
The Other Side got to him.
I would completely support that.
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
Is it over 'cause you're sick?
Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?
Well, what does it matter to you?
I can pass!
We're just going over a few things.
Of course, if it were that simple.  These people?  They're after something else...
I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?
Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure...
Am I missing something?
No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
What do you mean, four more?
Well, they're mine now.
Why do I have this life?
White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
Jesus Christ!  Listen to yourself! I can't do it, Grace.  I can't do it.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
That headboard.
Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
He's not Nick Mason...
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
Funny job.
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
Why should <u>you</u> care?
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
What are you talking about?
Matt, come here!
No!  Now get outta my face, kid.
I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
I agree. And for that service I charge one dollar taxi fare.
I mean tonight.
Sure I heard it. I still got one good ear.
...Her mother needs an operation...
Try twenty-five.
But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
Did the person you made love with satisfy you more than your husband?
What tickets?
You've come along a dozen times, Stephen, give your brother a chance. We'll be back in a few minutes.  How 'bout it, sport?
Don't worry. I'm long past saving.
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
We're partners.
I have a question to ask you. A personal question.
Zeena...
Do you know why I'm here?
May I open my eyes now?
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
You're insane.
After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
That's just what I wanna find out.
That's all right, really -
Talk what out? We are locked and loaded here. We are non-refundable. I've got relatives on the airport right now! I've got...
What did you say about a pet shop?
What did you say!
You know how I feel about her.
Paranoia's only reality on a finer scale.
Where have you been...
I want to go back to Vienna.
Yes - now let's see - where do you suppose the steward set it up?
Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
Sound?
You can't...
Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
I understand.
Dad's home, already?
You're not doing anything to me -- because -- listen to this carefully -- I do not care.
They're moving apart.
It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...?
I'm afraid so.
Yeah, well around here, I'm the Most High... From now on, before you do anything, call in for instructions.
Good luck, Buzz.
Go on. Go on send the telegram.
Jawohl!
...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...
Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
And you listen to that?
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
Excuse me?
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
I didn't see him !
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes.  Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.
<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
Not any more... now I like chocolate.
Well, I've certainly enjoyed it. -- What's that?
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
I suppose you want a cabin.
No.  Why?
Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one.
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.
Eight forty-two, sir.
Whose word?
Think Sloan's being set up as a fall guy for John Mitchell? Sometimes it looks that way.
It's me again.
<i>The children like to urinate in the balls.</i>
A pleasure.
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
Not very well.
I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
But she doted on the frowner
What?
What's wrong?
We'll pick it up.
He wants help with his lines --
Here, Pauly.
What about his suit?  That's a million five the company's got to replace.  They'll make somebody go get it.
Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked him.
No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
Hey, man, I'm a hip chick.
I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
I told the police.
No, forget it. The bet's off.
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
I know.
If we are clean Gollie will take us over at Nogales. If we are hot we'll have to try Laughlin at El Paso.
There's a spider in my room.
Babe Brother.
...Shut up.  Decide who should be dealt with how?  Is that the thing? I come into the fuckin' office today, I get humiliated by some jagoff cop.  I get accused of...I get this shit thrown in my face by you, you geniune shit, because you're top name on the board...
I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
What?
Understood.
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
...And?
So...how's the knee?
I've never seen him before.
They like my stories. They like the way I think. They're into fantasy. I turn them on.
Dad said it first.
Come on, don't bullshit me.
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
Is she fair, this princess?
Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!
Not for me, it ain't.
Not unusual.
What about when she identifies him?!
I had an accident.
It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
Hell no. Leastways, they won't pay to do it.
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover...
Thank ...you.
Gee, thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far. Extortion, coercion. You'll pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker. The same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me They'll bail me out? Fuck you. You think you can catch Keyser Soze? You think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his head out? If he comes up for anything, it will be to get rid of me.  After that, my guess is you'll never hear from him again.
Grace, tell him.
No.
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
So you took his...
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
You're going to publish, he's going to perish... And why did you hire me for this?
That's what I thought. So let me put it this way...
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
You show me Regan's double: same face, same voice, same everything. I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut and I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter! And I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!
...hospital.
Get rid of Dodd for me.
But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table.
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
A fin!
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
No. I'm glad I'm home.
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
They'll kill you, you know they will. Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now.
I'm engaged.
I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
Air miles, you know. I mean, you know what that does to my stomach?
It was nobody's fault.
Yeah, yeah...
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.
Don't tip.
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
He was never turned into a frog!
He is.
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man - from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and - and - and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and - well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
I don't know yet.
Bye, Bye.
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
No, Edmund.  He's a man who can answer yes to those questions I ask you from time to time.
I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
What are you talkin' about?
Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
What are you doing here?
I don't freak out very often.
Winners don't do coke.  Or haven't you been reading the bumper stickers?
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
Nee sitch.  No way.
Why? How...
He's a freelance subversive?
Just a thought.
You tell me.
Sam took them to a movie.
It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
I like worrying about you.
You can go wait out in the car, you want to.
No joke.
But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people...
Yes, your highness.
You can go...
Yes, I guess you are.
No, thank you.
Can you make him stop!
You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
I believe you. Please...
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
But, Buzz --
I need the job.
No, fish is a PM food.
They're not paying me anything. They've already warned you twice; this is the last warning. Decide.
As much as Joe's?
I'll see you there.
We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
Oh no.  Do you?
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
Unfortunately no, these Americans are smart, they pay me only half now, half when I get them back to Cairo, so I must go all the way.
Come and get it.
What do you mean?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
"J".
Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks.
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
What happened to Vivo?! What the hell happened to Vivo?
Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look up.
Sure...He lives there?
Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
What about the chat rooms themselves?
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
Seven-thirty?
Hi.
I'm going to work.
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
What things?
Of course I am.
I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
No wine.
Geiger counter?
I'm sorry.
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
Sure.
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?
No, you're not....
Yeah.
Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a cheap room? Did I?
To make you feel better.
What was it?
How the hell did you get into the building?
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
You wish!
Perhaps...
I can arrange that. I like that.
For yourself -- and me.  I could get you a dozen assignments tomorrow... fashion, portraits --
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!
What kind of man *are* you?
Oh, all right  How soon they forget where all this comes from.
No.
...it is so on.
No you're not.
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
I don't care.  Cretin.
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
When you get the AK, open up. You got me? Open up.
I don't like to fight.
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm FurtwÃ¤ngler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
Yes.  Not that much at first.  But then she became more comfortable.  Started visiting me every week...
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
Uh-huh.  You recall, did it say dead or alive?
Who have you been talking to?
It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
I'm up.
Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
No.
There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good people-they ought to run you out of the country-and I hope they do it!
Shit.  Shit, shit, shit!
Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye.
What's my rap?
Fine!
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
You don't.  You just learn to live with it.
Roper...
Who else were you expecting?
Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
You've been drinking.  What the hell are you saying?  Jesus, you sound like them now! ...  I've gotta keep fighting, Buddy, for the country.  These people running things, the elite ... they're soft, chickenshit faggots!  They don't have the long-term vision anymore.  They just want to cover their asses or meet girls or tear each other down.  Oh, God, this country's in deep trouble, Buddy ... and I have to see this through.  Mother would've wanted no less of me ... I'm sorry, Buddy.
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
Yes, it is.
They do it only because you do!
So you're saying she moved out.
To see ya train.
You're not going to be there?
You'll be linked during the entire operation.
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
Three hundred?
So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.
We have to!
I love you, too!  I love you daddy.  Love ya, dad.
Let's not talk about that now.
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
Why?
What are you talking about?
But I told her to go with you.
No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.
If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
Who told you to do that?
What's with the dark?
She was born without a tongue.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
Y'know what?  Fine.  I guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there's no quicker way to show them.
You told him about me?
No wonder you're such a chickenshit.  Now shut up.  There ain't no bat.
Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
Not quite.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
Oh, yeah, really, oh!
So lay it off to somebody else.
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
Fishing.  Look, Jimmy... I need you to help me.  This is serious.  I'm in trouble and I need you to help me.  Can you do that?
Then-you run.
I'll do it.
Why? ...what?
Well, are you? Are you queer?
Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
You're there.
Pardon?
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
How he must have loved you.
How can that be?
The Lymphatic System drains off excess fluid from the Tissues. Without it, we'd all swell up like balloons. He reaches the console, begins to take out a new chart.
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Keep trying.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
Lily... Jesus Christ...
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
What John Doe?
Right!
That's right - pour it on.  Talk me out of it.
Let me finish dinner before you eat it...Chop the peppers....
Yeah?
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
Words.
In how long?  A week?
Of course not.
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
Donnie, I'm afraid I can't continue this conversation. I could lose my job.
I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love.
Monkey, this is too exciting! I can't believe our dream is coming true.
And you don't.  What's she doing in there?
You didn't hear?
Really? I poop too much.
Yeah...
So?
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
Yes.
I'll pay.
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I want to teach our baby.
What?
Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
Good...then you can go...  I don't like violence.  I'm a businessman, and blood is a big expense.
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
How's your twenty?
Certainly, but...
Take a seat -- you're next.
I wanna go home.
Kirsty?
So do I.
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
Technically, they are still under the Clemenza wing of the Corleone Family, now run by Frankie Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died, the Rosatos wanted territory of their own.  Pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them.  I, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter, turned him down.  Pentangeli was furious, and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed. I was lucky and he was stupid. I'll visit him soon.  The important thing is that nothing jeopardize our plans, yours and mine.  This thing of ours, that we will build.
I'm sorry.
What? Walk out there and twist her arm off?
Any idea who could've done it?
So I don't call either way.
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
She Chicano, yes?
Not...complaining, actually.
Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...
The ship... Out of danger...?
Is everything ready?
Okay?
So we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. And, Krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin' believe it.
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
Have you had any relationship since?
Stay in the truck.
It didn't discourage you, though.
To put the rout all that was not life.  And not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.  Pledge Overstreet.
I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street.
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.
I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?
Because my mom gets the bill.
Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
Okay ... Max!  And you can call me Leo.
Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.
You're gonna get your fix...
I know you're not yet -- but you will be, soon.
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
Gee--I'm sorry about that, Miss--you *are* Miss Saunders, aren't you?
Pray.
I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view.  I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now...
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
... to prevent an enemy from doing just what we're attempting; using <u>our</u> console to tap in a message, an order to lower Reliant's damn shields...
Hungry.
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
Come on.
No Harry, you can't.
I know!
Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We did it...Damn! We sure did it!
I volunteered.
Jake, sit down for a minute.
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
Get knotted.
Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
My life is over.  Go.
But she does work here?
That's for sure.
Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't have to come.  It's great. You're going to love it.
What do you want for dinner?
I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!
I love those springy head puppies!
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
Fifteen.
Sorry, mistress.
What?
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
Enough though, eh?
What about them?
No, thank you.
Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the Festival of Love?  You make any sense in that?
I believe women from New York eat mixed salads. Ain't that right, Tom?
Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here?
Oh.
You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
No.  I want to buy a dog.
I had a feeling you would say something like that. So I brought us dinner.
Where... how'd you hear that?
Did you get rid of Mark?
Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
You're kidding yourself.
I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
Your grandmother. She named them after virtues I lack. That's marriage for you.
Wade?
Falling.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
Nick!... I thought you went home.
Objection.
Yep.  Sleep fast.
If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
Lava's hateable.  I never thought of that.
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
You mean like "time flies"?
Why not? This place is dead anyway.
What?
Yes.
I know.
That's right.  I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --
Yes.  They're free.
Think what you like. But don't presume to understand.
Why would he need more?
Ever see hurling?
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
Like me?
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
'Kay, Mac!
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
Yes.
That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
Yeah.
Fuck the Machine.
It's better...  You see, it's my turf, so I don't want contracts I'm not informed about, on my turf.  I'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?
And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. So I don't say nothin' and he says, 'What do ya think about that?'  So I says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'
-- did you understand me when I said that --
Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see.
I don't know, Boss.
I can go hotter!
Just let me tell you how it begins.
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
Have I?
The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.
Who?
I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
That song.  I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
A fingerprint.  There's something to be said for nostalgia.  What did you find?
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
And how many people did you cut up with the couple of with it? Or hundred knives you've probably owned in your lifetime?
Mortal.
It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.
Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
Somebody took it out of commission last night.
We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
Why'd you apologize?
Let Billie finish.
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.
Mookie's OK.
But you knew what they were training you for?
Yes, you do.
I'm not catching a melody.
I'm gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want eggrolls?
Here...
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
* Well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
Well, how much would you like?
No. What is happening?
Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't mean to -
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
Yes.
Then you must spend your life answering questions.
Yes, Baron.
Gal... Matthew ain't doin' shit... this just a story...  Look it. I've seen it in nature, I've seen it in men. Ya got to change up your crop. Cuz that seed ain't gettin' in.  Ya gotta cut this shit out. Got no cause to be up under these fools, ruttin' on ya like you a bitch. Like you somebody's dog. No woman... who joins in union with Almighty God... or man... in the sanctity of marriage... should degrade herself... and bend to ANOTHER MAN'S WILL!
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
No--an' look what I got for you.
Sure.  Sure.
What?
Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
No, you don't!
How many people were in your old school?
You were the new and improved you.
What about us?
Screw the dogs!!  Torch it!!
Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else.
What did he do this time?
What did she mean by going flooey?
What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists?
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
You're really leaving, huh?
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
Hey, fuck you.

No.
Sorry.
I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
Hmmm.
She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.
At...
I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
You're an imbecile.
You betcher ass, Dad.
Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.
I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.
And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
What?
This be it?
I'll call them, Lowell.
Of course not.
Oh now, they can't do that to me.  It's all your fault.  Oh yes it is and if they don't turn up I wouldn't be in your shoes for all the...
I know.
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
That's easy. Antiseptics.
What?
The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
You bastard...
What?!!
You don't know what you're saying. You're going to leave this place, Jeanne -- you're going home -- or whatever you want -- you're going to be happy, and have children, and...
I know we are. But as the years go by, we become even worse. Isn't that so, Corrado?
Oh, c'mon.
Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.
For heaven's sake, why not?
That's what I'm talking about.
What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
Have your department make a full report.
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
And you didn't get it, hey? Come on, we'll have another talk with him.
What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man!
Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
Have you found Dr. Bright?
Louis, I swear I did not.
No.  But him I believe.  He us genuinely angry.
I see...
...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
What are they?
Sorry, can you give us a moment?
So why do you want to go?
You wrote it, didn't you?
'To learn all that is learnable.'
Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.
You got it! See you later honey.
So your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons.
Have you identified it?
Many of them, many did not possess proper arms.  My lord.
I've told you.
Doug, don't!
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
You can't believe all that's accidental? That there isn't a Creative Intelligence at work --
Son?
What the fuck you talkin' about?
She's right.  You got an icepick in you yet?
Nixon.
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
You didn't need to do that. You just didn't.
Jon, what is it?
Right, the big one-oh.
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
Asshole probably got lost.
Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
Will you give me...
I'm glad you came to me for help.
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running from.
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
Thank you.
Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.
No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
Thank you, Doctor McCurdy.  Your witness.

Oh -- where do you come from?
...why am I here...?
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
I'm a housewife.
I didn't say you did.
I'm aware of that, sir.
I'd like to make a swap.
Yes, we did.
How much!?
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Whatever you say.
Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.
Yeah.  Thanks.
What is it you're after, Miles?
Okay... let's say that, for now.
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
You're crazy.
She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what you're implying.
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
Yeah.
Uh unh.
Let's send out a pigeon!
I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
If you could meet God, what would you say to him?
I need you.
To the Black Pearl.
I know, everyone says that.
What's that, peanut?
God, I'm so sick of Seymour.
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
So. You never know when you can end up like that.
Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
It's a change.
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
I don't understand...
I will not! Kill me now!
See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
How?
Sounds quite beautiful.
He's dead enough. God rest his soul.
It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.
That's the downside. There is none.
Like I said, yeah --
I had photos of my kids, plus a mug --
You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually?
I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
out again?
I can get it.
No.  Hate the fear inside of you! Climb like a man mister!  Hate it! Hate it away.  Hate your way up one more rung!!  Do it right now!!
Damn, you're beautiful.
That's a movie, you moron.
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
Well... how have you been?
Need a nurse?
Oh fucking relax.  Let your hair down for once.  It's your fucking birthday, for Chrissakes.  You're such a fucking pussy.  I swear to G-d, I married this big time drug dealer and wound up with the maid.
--and that he changed his will?
Sorry.
And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.
You're Polish?
For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins. It's a morality car wash. It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples. And, along with making us legit...
Then you've got nothin' to worry about.
I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel.
I'll take him over mine.
See, Daddy.
Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
Ohmygod! OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!  He's not dead?
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
Why is that?
I had a feeling you would.
I'll kill you, you fuckin' faggot! You mind your own business. Now get out! Now, before I get too mad to turn back.
You?
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
Listen to yourself, Wyatt.  Lie Down and crawl or you might get Hurt?  What kinda talk is that? That's Virgil lyin' over there, Wyatt.  Our own brother.  Ruined For life.  No sir, I ain't going No place.  You want to go, fine. I'm stayin' right here and have It out with those bastards.
And it's just in one ear?
I don't get it.
What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
You ever going to bed?
Don't just stand there, get help!
The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
How is Central these days?
R.K. Maroon.
Ow...
Excuse me.
Say again?
Sorta room-mates?
Could be worse.  They could have found it in your eye.
You work that out with La Senora.  You will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the Malaysian ship.  For collection in North Miami.  You warehouse it. Release it when we say.  I'm sure you have friends with fast boats...
Harry is coming to pick me up.
Simple. They don't want him to go.
I already know about the riots, d'Artagnan, I heard them out there whispering.  Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food.  I will deal with it tomorrow.
Yeah, it would've helped. Have you gotta cigarette Father?
See, I never knew that.
Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.
Wisconsin.
No that's it.
