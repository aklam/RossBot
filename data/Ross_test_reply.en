Still this is amazing Oh my god, thank you, Phoebe.
Oh. This was amazing.
What?
Great. Thanks!
Huh. This is nice.
Thanks for the help, problem solved.
Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
Thanks!  Thank you!
well Phoebe, I think you'll feel better when you know a little bit about Vicrum, His a Kite designer  and he used to date Oprah.
He is my girlfriend 's father, okay? It's-it's, it's weird!
How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
Oh that's nice.
I, uh, I'll go see.
Well I 'm, I'm a little slow.  Just as our children would be.
What, uh... what were you thinking?
Keep dancing.
Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.
You're wrong.
Please, please stay with me. I am so in love with you. Please, don't go.
Did you just say  "break up with Charlie"?
What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!
Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y 'know no commitment.
Well I have to. Okay? If I don 't, they'll take the class away from me. And I already put it in my family newsletter.
No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
Here's my retainer!
Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?
Oh, and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing. I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond.
Somewhere maybe along the equator?
What?
No?
What? Rach! Come on, that's terrible! They're uh they're babies. They're-they're all beautiful.
I 'll be right there.   Hello!  Hello!  Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan.
Hopefully.
Oh I, I don 't-I don't think that would be the best idea.
I am, yes.
I don't care. Whatever is the cheapest.
No you 're not.
Yeah, yeah!  You sure this is what you want?
I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
Emily.
Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do.  Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again?  Ask again later. Later is not good enough.  Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!
Okay, what does it mean?
In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm
Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!
Yeah baby!
So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?
Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.
Oh Ross Geller
I thought so.
Must pee.
Oh!... Right!
Got me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?
Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers.
Yeah-uh!
Yeah.
Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
Good.
Stay away!
I was going to tell you, but
Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?
Ooh, well. Ah, I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man.
Why, why, why would you dream that?
Hi. Sorry I'm late. Where's, where's Carol?
Thank you.
Well look-look I 'm not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million years ago!
Ah, that 's okay, thanks.
Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that?
Good luck!
Good for a scrud.
No! Why?
Seriously you guys, what's going on? What are these for?
Oww!
But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.
Oh, we just...
Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?
Uh sweetie, maybe you 'd be more comfortable here?
Ugh.
You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?
Hey!
What?! You totally get embarrassed!

Learn about Jesus...
It's not the best!
Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that.
Okay, you go grab it!
I know.
Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!
That's what I'm telling you.
I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
Hey.
Yes, yes it is. It 's uh  Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
Like buddies.
Hey-hey, it 's valid okay? And I'm not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me.
Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
What?!  Give-give me a brush.
Mmm hmmm.
Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.
Okay, you ready?
Awww.
Rachel!!!
That's a good point.
Hey.
Oh, thanks Gunther.  STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!
Tho?
Okay, that's, that's enough.
That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben.  Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.
Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.
About the yelling.
Oh, I 'm just over here with Ben. I thought we'd say hi.
OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Oh shoot, tomorrow 's not so good, I'm supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.
What?! What do you mean? You-you-you 're not pregnant?
Oh, I know.
Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
Okay. Honey?
What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!
Oh.
Yes.
Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.
Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.
Wow!
That was you?
That'd be good...
Neither will I.
All right, fine.
The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate.
What? How come that you don't have to go!
Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y 'know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was-if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist.
Actually, nectarines, but basically...
Yeah.
Why?
Hi!
No, I 'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.
Alright...
Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?

Okay, okay take a guess.
Fine, I 'm mentally unstable.
In your mouth?!
Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.
Do you really?
In London!
Hey!
Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily 's parents got married here.
One.
Will!
Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more
What?! What?
Hey!
Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
Oh my God! I 'm sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot.
I have no idea!
He 'll be fine.
No.
Yeah that 's what she said.
Well umm, I 've been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.
Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everything's gonna be alright.
Yeah, I 'm-I'm sure.  Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind.
Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I don 't know any of it and I'm the father. I wish I'd be more involved y'know.
Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?
That 's cool.
My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
Yeah.
That 's right!
What? We're never gonna make it!
Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?
Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!
Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.
What's going on?!  That's what's going on!!
Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that!
Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together.
Huh!
Dr. Franzblau, hi.
Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
What?
Let me see this...  Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division.
Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.
Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?
Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
Yes, we have to tell her!
Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?
Got me.
Hey guys!
Hey.
Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World.
If like the four of us could all y 'know, hang out together. Uh, in fact Emily's coming into town this weekend, why don't you say we all have dinner? Say, Sunday night?
No, no, no, no!
Ohh.
Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything 's gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come on.
Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?
Okay!  Hey Tommy.
Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there.
No!
Uh-uh -Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn't really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I'm the one dating Elizabeth, not you!
Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.
Yeah, I'm missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.
Look, I-I don 't want to miss anymore baby stuff. So Here. Here's my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! I'll be there! Okay? I don't care if it's three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.
Okay.
Well, if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him?
Ohh.
Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um.
You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
Okay. Okay. Y 'know what? If you want to, we can do it one more time. I mean I'd-I'd be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now.
I know.
Okay, all right, I 'll take you. I'll go call Joan.
I know. My arm is killing me.
I know, why not?
Hey, y 'know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron!
Well that's the first time we've said that.
No-o-o!  No way!
Yeah!
What?
I liked her.
No, no, I just have to talk to someone.
Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
Well, not playing raquetball!
Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole  'Does it?' part just another glance.
Yeah, they all know.
Of course it's your friend Tanya.
Rachel, please
Got it!
What do I do now?
Why?
Whaddya see?
Hey.
Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married.  We register, and you get to keep all the presents!
Oh my God.
Monica said that did she?
Yeah.
Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her.
Rachel please! That is so inappropriate!
No seriously. I have job security for life. You know, I never have to worry.  Oh, look at you. Look how happy you are for me.
Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for all hanging out but to come to my home!
Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?  Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
Are you sure she 's in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma's glycoma medicine again?
Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a two some with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
Wow! Uh how are you?
I'm getting ready for the water skiing.
Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.
Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can 't sleep without it.
And, I came up with Atlantic City.
I know.
Ok, Michelle, it's time to go.
Yeah, kinda. It 's this woman from work. I hope that won't be too weird. Will it, Rach?
Seven.
OH.....MY.....GOD!!
What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?
Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words  "Will you marry me?"
Wow, how many have you got?
Okay!
Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie.
Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don 't you think you could at least hear the guy out?
Okay, that-that 's enough! Y'know, let's, let's let someone else play.
Hey!
Oh my God!

Yeah, I didn 't think of that.
Oh c'mon. Maybe you're just, uhhh... paying your dues.
Uh-huh.
I don't know...
Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the  "I get to see my wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this.
About four hours.
Ohh... OK.
Oh my god.
Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon...
But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone.
Um, see, but that 's not the final draft.
Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here -but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
So unbelievable. She was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with Emma.
Joey what-what were you thinking?!
Mma, Mma, Mmaah
No!
Oh yeah? You 're going further down! Downtown!
Y 'know what? I'm good! I'm good!
Well, I 'm gonna lie to you Joey, it's a possibility.
Except for "Match game"...
Hi Jill.
There was never a good time.
Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be.
It's morphin time!
No, that 's all right.
Y 'know what? You're just upset because you're losing.
So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?
Thank you!
I'll do it!
Alright, I want my monkey.
What?! No!
You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?
Oh hey, hey Mark.
Six months Rachel, six months.
Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?
Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute.
Hey!
Nice!
Yes.
All right, ready?
Oo-oo!
Well, what do you do?
Okay, each team will answer ten questions. The first team that answers the most questions wins. Okay, the categories are, Fears and Pet Peeves, Ancient History, Literature, and It 's All Relative. Now, the coin toss to see who goes first.  Okay, somebody call it this time.
So, listen guys, are we uh, are we ok here?
Shhh! We 're not talking.

It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
I don't know. What's in this pie?
Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.
Hey!
No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together.
You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms.
All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.
Need some help?
You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?
Remember? You-you were eating pizza.
Cool.
WOW!
Hi! Hey!

Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.

Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ....
I've lost the will to live.
Yeah.
Dude! How-how did you write this?
No, Rach!
A lesson in the importance of unagi.
Yeah that's the same.
Oh, major shampoo explosion!
That's right, sex is off the table.  I am never having sex with you again.  Dr. Green, are you feeling better?
What?
What do you like better flora or fauna?
Saw your head. Saw your head.
Yeah, he's head of the department.
Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I 'd take that bad boy out for a little spin.
How about you?
Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.
Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.
I can't believe this.
You're on!
Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn 't stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a first bike, so
I 'm asking you to do me a favor.
Yeah.
I don 't think so. Hello?  When you get in there
What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?
It's from Ross, it's a love bug.
Little girl misses her cat.  Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.  Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
What?
Well I-I-I don 't care how hot it is it's-it's uh, it's wrong.
He finally asked you out?
Hmm.
Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.
Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
Oh my God! Of course, of course.  Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other 's hometowns? Why don't you   Wh-what's going on?
what's up, Dad?
What 's wah-pah?
Okay, go left. Left! Left!
And so do I.
Oh you know, pretty much the usual, uh, sun shining, birds chirping.
Huh.
You 're welcome.
You can 't do that!
Well I 'm sorry but, that-that's really not my problem.
I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! .  Oh! My God! You're breathtaking!
Monica 's right. We're talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can't just rush into this.
Really? You don 't think that's a little inappropriate.
Gimme back my monkey.
Wow! This is very flattering, uh...
Well, you should 've seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he's like Joe Rugby.
Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?
What?
Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there's this one thing Okay,  here goes. I made a promise that--Oh hey!
I will give you a call.
You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.
Hey.
Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.
Ah, he didn 't uh, take it so well?
you look great.
Hey, hey!!
The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.
Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?
I'm Ross Geller. Wha, I'm, God in your add you said you were pretty but wow.
You didn 't tell her?!  Okay, fine! Pheebs?
Ok.
N-no! Okay? We 've been through this! We're not gonna get married just because she's pregnant, okay?
Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?
Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.
Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y 'know, we- we said our good-byes this morning, so
You 're alone.
Did I, did I even treat?
Nope.
Hi!
I don 't know. I mean I-I guess I could. It's just that we didn't really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I'd be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die.
Uh-huh. Thank Joey!
Thanks.  I-I think I'm dying. I really do.
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.
Hey Rachel.
Here, check it out. It 's the first one, too.
Y 'know what? I don't like you without mom.  Come on.
I don't know, umm
What?! That's not gonna make you any money!
Hi!
What? Is it the comet?

Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
Ooh, Ooh.
Gimmie!
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...

Well, I 'm not going to go now anyway .
Oh, thank you.

Who 's Chip?

No... I already e-mailed her.
Hey, don 't we have to...
Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?
No. No.
Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!
After what I did? Can you blame her?
Okay, okay, I 'll tell 'em it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
Cool!
That's Ben, my son from my first marriage.
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
That 's impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we- we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
That guy, he burns me up.
Yay!
Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn 't. That's why I'm here. Maybe we could attack them together?  That-that's a no.
Rach we have a code brown situation.
Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
What?
Tag? Y-You're going?  Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?
Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.
Y'know this ??? is incredible.
Hey guys!
Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I 'm trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I'm putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?
And they knew about it?
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?
Yeah.
Hey, where's Rach?
...Yeah?
Yeah. She 's putting her down now, that's her.
Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
Thanks!
Isabella Rosselini.
What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!
Oh, sorry. Well, look, maybe I can help you with it.
All right-all right, fine! I-I 'm gonna call the cops!
Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident...
Actually umm
Oh my God, is that still...
Y 'know what? She'd-she'd love this.  Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver.
Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game.
No.
Bye Janine!
Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?
Why am I not surprised?
Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking
Okay. Okay. Because for a minute you said you

Well, do you wanna marry him?
Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.
What 's a koondis?
Well, fine. Fine! If-if I 'm the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I'll go up there and defend it myself!  And don't you follow me!
Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating like this.
Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he 's leaving out 'e' and 'f.' It's like they just ah, I don't know, fell out of his head.
Alright.
It uhh, it won't go back.
Oh well that 's great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh?  Good bye.
What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose.
I know, me too. It was... You know, it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's everything you want it to be.
Open up. We want to talk to you.
Oh, hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!
Hello.  Ah, no, she's not here right now. Can I take a message?  Bill from the bar?  Okay, "Bill from the bar." I'll make sure she gets your number.
Hey, you guys.
Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!
Rach, have you never done this before?
Um, you you like Rachel?
Oh but not that way. I mean I mean I'm not in love with her. I love her like a, like a friend.
Looks like a fun gang.
Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here.
No way!
...Valentine's day...
Still I could tell. She was into me.  Well, why don't you set us up?
Hi.
It 's your joke.
What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?
Hi .
JOEY!!!!!!
C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.
Two seconds...
Look guys, when I 'm with her it's-it's-it's like she brings this- this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y'know?
Wow. What does that mean?
Oh, where are you guys going?
What?
Ahhhh!!
What -why?
Wow! Really?!
No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it 's all yours.
I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?
Where 's my ring? My dead grandmother's wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
Well, I'm gonna go get ready,  for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just head.
This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
Just, just, just pick one!
Hey! It 's 42-21!
No, its Its not that. Umm, now what I'm going to say to you, I'm not saying as your friend. Okay? I 'm-I'm saying as it as Monica's older brother.
Well y'know  'cause Rachel and I used to go out.
Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she 'd made.
I wanna get out of the room! Y'know, I I really miss downstairs.
What?
Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours.  It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
Hey, save us some pizza.
Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!
No.
No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.
How's the hair?
Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!
Dollars? You spent $1200 dollars on a plastic bird?
Turn! Turn!
Oh, this is Monica.
Believe me, if I did see with someone, there 's no way I...
Okay.
Yes. Yes. Just here  and there .
That 's excellent.
The uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I'm just saying I like it. The hair.
Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
I would say that.
They're towing a car. And I am seeing...spots.
I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn 't quite there. Y'know, I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy
I don 't know Rachel, why?
Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.
Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
Hi.
You guys.
No touch! No touch!
Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties on
Take thee,  Emily.  Like there 'd be anybody else.
What's going on?
Noo!!
I-I-am -
I think, subconsciously
We'll see how dinner goes.
YES, YES!
Can I get some of that action?
Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
Hey!
I 'm trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.

Uh-huh.
Why not?
I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel.
Really. It's always been you, Rach.
Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.
I Ross...
Ok, ok, here we go.  Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
No, it 's okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don't
Actually, it looks really good.
What's that supposed to mean?
Um, no.
No, I can 't get it out.
Check again please!
Petty...
You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
This guy could be my baby 's stepfather!
Why?
Awww, man! Really?
Hey, y'know while we 're on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don't live here anymore.
Are you OK?
Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much.
Yeah.
Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.
You're right!
That is really nice lying! No way is that the reason!
Oh I don 't know that it would.
Hi Frannie, congratulations.
Phoebe, what are you doing?
Huh. Y 'know what's not one of a kind? A twin!
Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it?
I was gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream.  I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.
'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there.
Yeah!
Rachel?
Yeah, that'll do it.
Yes. Yes I do.
I don't know. Soap?
All righty roo.
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.
How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!
Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
You should get some sleep.
Later.
Rachel! Well, you-you 're not at home, you're-you're-you're right here.
C'mon, what, you never think about our future?
Yeah!
Rach, come on, I 'm not gonna wear any of this!  Nothing silver. . Ok? Nothing with hair!  And nothing with padlocks on it! .
Yeah.
Wow.
Good one, Rach.

Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.
Y 'know, maybe she is too young for me. Y'know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby- sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don't know what to do.
Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?
Yeah. Yeah, I think I will.
Monica!  Would it?
Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.
Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car
Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder!
What? What? What?
Carol's pregnant.

Oh.. oh... oh.
What?
I wasn 't talking to you.
No! Come on let 's-One more time! One final push! Ready? 1 2 3!
Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett...
You got off the plane.
Mmm.
Oh no! That-that 'll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y'know what? I'm buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it's in my pocket.
Good morning.
Wh-what's going on?
My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. She didn't get any fitter.
We were on a break!!! Okay!!  We were, we were...,  yeah. Where are you? I 'll find you.
Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...
Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
You 've got to be kidding me!
That is why!
I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.
Oh, it's fine. Actually, I, I invited Mike over.
Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and..., well...
I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie!  Hi Joey.  And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend.  I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know.  Come, please come in. Come in.
Thanks a lot.
Excuse me, your, your, your wind?
All right, maybe it means that too
Hi.
Oh yeah, aww!
Yeah. There 's no breaking them up, is there?
Hey umm, was-was Monica here?
No! Do you wanna hear it?
Yeah.
What?
I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
Oh, of course...
No.
um... I've never heard of a  "Boscodictiasaur".
Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
Yeah, yeah.  It wasn 't every morning.
Look, I  Look, I 'm having a great time with you and I just don't want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So, I'm sorry I just don't think we should go away together yet. It's-it's too soon.
Oh, okay.
When they see this you'll be 52!
Okay, umm
Challenge extended.
Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.
Hey.
Sweetie, now I pick you.
So umm, where are the other guys?
Hello? Hi.
Nuh, uh, the moment's gone.
Hey!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What 's with the tackling?
Doctor Burke is sexy?
Right, no, I understand.
You keep, you keep... You can't...
Well actually, I 'm picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he'll be there.
Yeah, he can do it!
Hey!
Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!
Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, here 's what happened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and a half ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing.
You set her up?!
Ready sweety?
Absolutely.  I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really,  I'm fine. I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. I mean, at first I was like..  But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this.
Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.
Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?
No.
...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
Okay,  so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh, wood-burning ovens?
Of course.
Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here.
Okay. Sure.
Ni-chou chi-ma!
Sit down.
I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...
Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. .
Good, 'cause I love you.
No, no, they will. I just... uh...
Am I?!
I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
It 's not like we don't know how to party!!
You called Animal Control?
Well, whatever it is I'm-I'm very, very sorry. Okay?
Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.
Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.
No-no it 's not. What-what happened there Ned?
Come on!!
Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
Why aren't you guys dressed?
Yeah.
Gimme this.
It 's possible, they have really sharp edges.
What is that?
Well you shouldn 't be. Believe me I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you.  I mean that doofus is going to lose!
Oh! And it gets worse!
What?
. Good choice Ross.
So uh, what did you tell them about me?
No, he's at uh, Carol's and Susan's today.
Hey.
3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ...
Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
But now! I 'm there! I'm totally there! I'm-I'm finally where you are!
That 's my gym.
Not two years in a row.
Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools.
So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?
Come on Rach, you can 't even eat alone in a restaurant.
Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin ' in there.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We're not 13 anymore.
Don 't blame the questions!
Well, oh, I 'm sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?
And the place looks so nice!
Are you out of your mind?
I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y 'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so
Yeah, Sarah, anything.
That's easy for you to say, you found one already.
No, a car backfired, but  I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose -I mean I-I'm not proud of it but, I really am. And it's all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
Oh my God!
I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.
Hi.
I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...
The chocolates aren't here yet.
Dude, you are sick.
Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
I think it 's coming from your bag.
What?! No! No! That 's-that's time-out!
I don't know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?
No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I 'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore.
11, unbelievable, 11 is correct.
Susan is Carol's, Carol's, Carol's, friend...
I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.
Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines.
And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um I didn't propose to you.
Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
Nooooo!
Wow! I didn 't know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.

Sure.
'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?
Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then. Ha haaa...  He stinks!
At the vet.
I don't think they saw us.
When have you ever?
What?
Multiple orgasms!
You 're not getting away this time mister! Unless you want that ass kicking we talked about!
It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.
Um-hmm! Doesn 't that sound delicious at the last minute?
A  '95 LeSabre?!
Pheebs, what's wrong?
What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person who 's going to enjoy these bad boys  is me.
No, you, ya know there's no need to make it u. . . how?
Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice!
No, I don 't want to hit you.
Not yet.
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster
No, you don't understand. This isn't a real cab.
I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.
That may be the most depressing thing I 've heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer's office.
So?
You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
So...
Guess what? I made Emma laugh today.
Phoebe, she doesn 't know that you sneak out every night, she doesn't know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn't know that you've been living with your Grandmother's for a week now.
I'm not supposed to tell you!
What?!
Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger!  I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like,  "Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!"  I kinda scared myself.
Wow, this is really soft . Three hundred and fifty dollars?
Veto. Helen?
Why?! Why on the lips?!
Ok!... Uh... excuse me? Yeah?
Hey!
Rach, you can 't look fat in an x-ray.
Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.
Ohh!!
Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!
Linda Clickclocken.  So what uh, what-what table are you at?  Oh, uh me too.
Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!
Yeah?
Yeah! Yeah, we can!
So?
You see this, this is a person who is ready to go. Phoebe you, oh, you are my star.
I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! What do I have to do to get some service?!  Hi Rach.
That is so unfair!
Okay.
Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel?
Okay, stop it! I can 't deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby.
Uh, I don 't know, whatever.
There 's the one!
You can live with me.
Right. Okay, let 's play. Let's go.
How 's Monica coming along with her vows?
Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we 're gonna give her some! Okay, grab grab some empty boxes. Okay? We'll-we'll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we'll-we'll put 'em in their.
Wow, Rhonda.
Yeah!
His daughter was hot.
I think you need to tell her how you feel.
Oh.
What is the matter with you?!?
Look, if you 'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand!
No, I barely even got to three Mississippi.
And what are you going to do for him?
Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?
Okay, y'know what, let 's just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?
Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
Well do you want some help?
That guy Lipson?
Ok.
No, women are welcome to play.
No that 's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I
You, you go long.
Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.
Yeah, yeah you have the ring?
There's an image.
Well, I 'm sure they're still somewhere here in the hotel. I'll-I'll help you look for them.
Ross, wants a pajmena?
Thank you.
Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life.
You're not his godfather.
That 's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey.
Hey.
Huh?
There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.
Rach, you there?
I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.
Geez! Are you ready?
Oh my God!!
You were my first kiss with Rachel?
All right. Uhh, international.
Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.
Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay -and F.Y.I she must've shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was, "I don't give a tiny rat's ass."
Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
You see what men do! Don 't tell me men are not nice!  This is men!!
Thank you.  C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling?  Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.
You can see where he'd have trouble.
Hey...
Yes, I did , I did!  I should have written it down!
Yes, that's what I have. It's not on the board.
Hi. I 'm Ross Geller. I live in the building.
Oh, I know. Y 'know what, I never would've gotten this if it weren't for you. No really, when I'm with you I'm-I'm like this whole other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love that guy!
M!
What?! What?! Talking about what?!
What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
Is everything okay?
Hey!
It 's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay?  Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
Hey, you wet my pants!
Go? Why?
Joey had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
Uh, Rach.
Boss!
Come on.
Yeah? Yeah, where is it?
Yeah, it 's the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!
Oh, you-you sure?  Okay.  Okay. So what 's uh, what's your name.
Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!
I- I think they're great! I, I really do.
Y 'know I don't understand why they didn't cry. It was a beautiful speech.
Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died.
That 's, that's, that's a big candy bar.  I had the most amazing time with you.
Someone at work ate my sandwich!
Oh, somebody 's feeling better.
Hi.
Yeah.
Hey man.
Yeah.
That 's okay, I'm not so crazy about myself right now either.
Whoa, sorry Tommy.
Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?
Okay.
I found a note on my door,  "Come to Monica's quick, bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar. "
Well, what about me?! I 'm a medical marvel!!
Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know I 'm looking for him?
Look, all I know is I-I can 't have another failed marriage!
Hey!
Go.
Hey, it 's been like three weeks!
He gave me a pill for it.
Umm, Jo 's a girl, it's short for Josephine.
Hey, it 's my list.
Crack isn 't even an intravenous drug!
Thank you.
Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever --can't do it.  Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.
You never cooked since 1996.
It's a day to be thankful.
Hey.
Okay. But not about this!
Oh, thanks guys!
Oh, damn it!
Y 'know what? Maybe, Mrs. Green, it's not absolutely vital that you live with us.
Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.
All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it.
Well, I 'm a spud
Okay. Have a great time you guys.
Oh! Oh!
What, it's not your fault.
You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!
Well yeah, but she doesn 't know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
Good yeah just be honest with him.
Humm, that sounds, I don't, perfect.
I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back.  Ow.
So much more.
Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!
Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!
Pheebs, you 're talking about putting your body through an awful lot, I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it's all for somebody else!
Yeah I know; he 's in Ben's class.
Uh, Pheebs, while we 're hovering around the subject. I just have to say dinosaurs, they-they don't go, rrroof!
Woah. Huh. You know about my, I mean, you know I had... you know?
Yes, yes, that's right...
Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.
Hey.
Well, that's cool. So did
You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good.
Laugh it up, but the joke 's on you. Because we don't need to get divorced, okay? We we're just gonna get an annulment.
Hey!
I-I-I don 't even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y'know what? I'm just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
You put an offer on a house?
What?! What?!
Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.
I'll take it. My gift to you man.
You are, you're welling up.
Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
What is that?
You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.
Hey!
How about we settle this right now!  There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!
You're over me?
No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.
SON OF A BITCH!  (To the
What are you talking about?
Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by  "bye!"
Maybe I should stand on your feet!
Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here
Seriously that's a lot of cups.
I hate that guy.
No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.
people  so why you all dressed up.
Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!
Hey!
No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?
Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he 'll wanna build us our own platform!
Yeah.
No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you're strongest when.. when you're together.
What you got over there? Tacos?
She 's going in. Wait! He's going in! He's going in!! The door's closed! I, I can't see anything but the door closed!!
He does not look happy.
Rach!
Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!
That 's right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film that Batman film he was in.
Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?
Good, so do I
Hi Tushie.
Wow!

Yeah, we 're not just doing a card! Y'know, she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going.
What, what oh....
Hmmmm .
Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose.
I know, I know it was stupid.
Dude, what am I gonna
Okay, it's not a contest.
All right.
Oh, now you can exchange them if you want, ok.
I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and and certainly passionate, but don't you think it's better if we just stayed friends?
My foot is stuck in the pocket.
Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.
What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?
Veto. Stewart?
You sang Baby Got Back didn't you?
Really?
Mom, y 'know what? I-I can't deal with this right now. I'm sorry
Well, this was fun. Uh, we should really do it again sometime, wha'dya say? Ok. Alright so I've got him.
Answer faster, answer faster!
Yeah.
Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?
Look, I don 't feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?
Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
I don 't know, something girlie.
Hmph.
Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
Let go! Let go!
Okay. Okay!
No!  I 'll be right back.
I am sorry, Chandler.
Okay let 's put aside that you  "accidentally" picked up my grandmothers ring and you  "accidentally" proposed to Rachel.
Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
Good morning. Nice breasts by the way.
Uh no, no just-just that he is a great guy.
Yeah?
Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
Real magic does exist.
Okay.  Ben? Come here. All right, I 'm gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?
Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I 'll help you out.
Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it.
Why don 't you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?
Okay.
Susan, go deep.
About about sex?  That I hadn't had sex in months?
Not so much.
Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?
Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?
Oh you guys are not gonna believe what happened.
Gimme the this!
Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just...
Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?
What?!
What?!
Come on.  All right, here we go. All right?
But I-I was going to see if y 'know, maybe you uh, start dating again but that-I mean that-that was all, Rach.
That's my sister.
You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
... And you called him Alby!?  I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...
Oh my God!
Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.
Actually that-that 's not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found  Y 'know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend's a lesbian.
Well thanks!
Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
OK, now I'm nervous.
Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.
Well, I guess that's it.
Hey Joey.  Hey you.
I can't believe that didn't work!
You are? Me, too!
Why? What, what are you jealous?
But hey, it 's not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.
Gas? Wow! Intense.
Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium. That 's-that's where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower
Damnit!
Hey, divorced men are not bad men!
G'night.
Err, right.
Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?
Joey, you shouldn't lie on your resume.
No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but I can't help it. I love marriage.
Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!
Good.
Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress.
Just uh, brought back your videos.
Well that 's different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me!
Maybe you should look up "fascinating."
Oh, that's not what you want...
Mon.
Eww.
Hey, here 's a thought.
Hey, honey.
Um... uh.... vulva.
Okay. Cool.
No! No! I 'm not! It's-it's-it's perfect! I mean it's better than you just-just moving here, 'cause it's us together forever, and that's-that's what I want.
What happened?
No, I stayed at Julie's last night.
Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!
Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good.  Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow.
I 'm gonna call her.
Ok fine.
No, no, that-that, that 's all right. Umm, I'm just glad you called.
They gave him a lot of medication, ok? He wouldn't even know if you were there. Look, we'll go see him first thing in the morning, ok?
I'm sorry, it's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway!
Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.
Hey, where 's Chandler?
Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we 're never gonna get along.
Huh, didn 't see that coming.
No!
No!
Okay.
All I have to do is close my eyes. See?  Woo-hoo!!
Uh, no, it 's-it's just this person.
Men. I guy I know.
Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a doctor! Okay?
I'm in for fifty cents.
Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?
Mine.
She is not  She 's gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can 't believe this.
You 'll see.
Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.
Yeah! C'mon!
Oh yeah, how about you and the,   "I'm sorry!"
You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?
Awwww!!!
Funny, my birthday was seven months ago.
Good weird?
I'll take sports.
Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybe kinda wanted ah start things up again.
Noo.
Woah.
I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
Good-bye! Good luck!
Hi! I 'm sorry, but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night.
That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.
We'll give you Janice.
Hey-hey, since you 're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?
Come again? What 's-what's this nonsense?   All right, I'm-I'm not English. I'm from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I'm sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions?  About paleontology.  All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I'm-I'm hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression
No! No! No!
Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Uh, so this play umm, what do you think? It 's-it's gotten great reviews! Y'know the uh
In the bank.
Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could,  'cause that's not where you want to skimp.
I would!
I -They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
Ok, gentlemen! Please! Aren't we a little old for this? I mean, we're scientists, right? We're academics. And most importantly I... you- you will have to catch us first. . GO, GO, GO!
Hey!
Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster?  So, ahh, where were we?
No. no.
We?
What?
'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?
Which is fine! Because you just turned --twenty-eight!
Hello?  No she can 't come to the phone right now.  Oh, right no problem. Okay, bye-bye.
Oh hi!
Um . . . ah . . . you know, I'm divorced. Um, Phoebe, ah . . . Phoebe said you . . . You've been divorced?
Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department.
Thanks. Oh.
You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee.
Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.
What? What?
Thank you.
Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let 's play some ball, guys.
Uh-oh...
What?!
I hope you 're a better father than you're a friend!!
Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And remember, you're daddy's little girl...  Phoebe's totally ruined that for me...
Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery!
Oh for cryin ' out loud!
Okay, gimme my monkey back.
No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!  Why didn 't I get head of the department?
What?!
Eh, no problem.
Come on, Pheebs lay off him.
Hey guys.
I know! It's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? I mean, call, or leave a note
It 's also a sign of friendship.
That 's the day you're gonna die? See-darnit, I've got shuffleboard that day.
You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok?
Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
That 's true, thanks dad.  People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!!
or...
Yeah!
Hey, uh, you can ignore that.
We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen.  Don't you hear that?
Mon.
Phoebe, why 'd you do it?
I have no idea. I mean But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
Break!!
Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday.
We can 't do it again.
What the hell happened on that beach?!
Y 'know what?
I got it!
Oh, you-you 're-you're one to talk.
Ohh, it was the best!
And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!
Happy New Year, Pheebs!
Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!
What?
Go away! I don't want to see anybody.
I 'm really glad we came.  You're so pretty. I love you.
Are you kidding?
Okay, so what 's the matter?
Oh. Yeah?
Uh, we, y'know, we worked things out.
What?
I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?
Really?
Oh, thanks!
Oh my God, Phoebe, slow down!
When I got married you slept with my sister.
Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?
Y 'know, I don't think we're going to settle this.
Ow!!
What?!
Noo!
Of course I am!  Okay, let's go godfather.
And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.
Okay.
73! 72! 71!
Oh, god.  You know, this is still pretty hot.
All right, I'll see you guys later.
Yay!!
Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
I'll see you in the morning .
You know, I, I used to, ah, play keyboards in college.
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!
Oh, you're right, I'm sorry.
Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can 't? Okay.
No!!
I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice  I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!
Is that Mark?
What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that.
Going out with who?
Sure, we don't live there but...
Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six!
Oh yeah it 's fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.
Two! I 've been engaged twice!
October 18th.
I am!
All right! All right! All right!  We are fixing it.
Really?!
Oh umm, there 's also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina.  What is that?
Chandler!
Are you gay?
Ahh, no, I 'm good.
Yeah?
Yeah, well.
A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!
Sure, what do you got?
What?
Hey!
Wha -What?
Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
I have to break up with Charlie?
Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing.  Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes -Do-do you want to make out?

Mmm.  Oh, no-
Oh no-no-no, we 're just two people who happen to run into each other here at the coffee house.
No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can't put them back on. I can't!
All right everyone, lift!  And slide!!
Apparently, Sting 's son made fun of the fact that Ben's moms are lesbinims.
Elizabeth!  Okay. Okay.  I 'm gonna go out this window.  I'll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you're going home, okay?
Ahhhh!!
Hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...?  do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?
Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--
Hey, what do you say we celebrate? Champagne?
Okay. So we're, we're good?
Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!
Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this?  This tiny thing that looks like a peanut?
What?!
All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number!  And not the one on the menu!
Come on, two on one.
What-what are you doing?! Are you -Okay that's not funny! Just stop horsing around!
I'd love to!
Joey 's asking if you've just ruined the first book he's ever loved that didn't star Jack Nicholson?
You don't believe in evolution?
What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes??
Hi.
Yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread.
30 seconds on the clock. 5 questions wins the game. The lightning round begins now! What is Joey's favorite food?
I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...
No Joey! Look why don 't, why don't we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we'll each go out with her one more time. And-and we 'll see who she likes best.
Wow!
That 's a duck.
10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
Uh, never mind, I don't want to know.
Yeah. Hate him.
Oh great! What, you brought Joey?
I do have a newfound respect for life.
Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven 't seen that since the forth grade!
Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one time -not any more. I just-I...
Oh!
Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn 't count.
Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Emily?!
I went thru this with Ben and Carol. One cup of coffee won't affect your milk.
Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.
Why?

At least tell me where you hid it.
Rach, you can't call people at three in the morning.
No, no, we will. We just won 't tell her she messed up.
You wanna buy a car?
That's, that's funny. Change!
Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?
Faded salmon color.
Why- why- why would he need a blade?
Uh... to the bathroom.
A superhuman thirst for knowledge.
Oh right, right.  So, are you . . . ah . . . you excited about your, your first night away from Emma?
I can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today.
What?!
Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
Okay I put most of the stuff away.
Aw, we-we are so  So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y'know hanging out with you. And I mean-I'm having a lot of fun.
Hey, Phoebs, how'd it go.
You comin'?
The volcano?
Hey.
Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.
Sweep, sweep....
Ohh.
Listen Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about this.
What?
Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell-o.
Knock-knock.
You know where Joey is?
Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental
Fine.
We are four short of a bush-o . God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!
Oh, oh my God, is this the wrong day? I don't believe it, uh, well, hey, I guess if it works out we'll, we'll have something to tell the grandkids.
So, you 're not going to Paris.
That is gonna hurt tomorrow!
Come on, it's fun!
What?  Great, now I'm having a baby.
I have sex with dinosaurs??
What?
Bec -Did you not hear me?! She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They're wild! Why do you want to come anyway?
Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
Yeah, I 'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
Hey Rach!
Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody.
Oh, I'm threatened by you?
And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on.  Easy.
Hey!
Shh! Shh! Shh!
Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.
Look, if you don't know what the word  "acrimonious" means, just don't use it!
Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!
Only when it was damp!!  I can 't believe you-you told people about this?! Everybody knew?! Y'know what?  I'm back in the club!
No! No! No!
Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.
Fascinating.
Oh! That 's nice.
I love it, when we share.
Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
What trail?
Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?
Shouldn't the pizza be here by now? I mean, they said thirty minutes or less. Well, how long has it been?
Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I don't want to infect him.
Well uh
Yeah, well.
Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel?  I will think about the therapy.
Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to have sex tonight.
Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn 't about the room, this is about what the room represents! And unfortunately, this room  could destroy you!!
Get out!
Everybody put their balloons down!!!  Now this is a nice suit!!
Oh my God! Monica!
Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.
...Now that was fun.
Dude.
So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.
Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
They don 't look any bigger than me!
Totally!
Here we go!
It's just a fur ball.
So-so what did the doctor say?
Really?
Oh...  Little heads-up would have been nice.
Oh-oh, were you, were you watching?
Small...
What? What's wrong?
Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.
Okay, that's great.  No, I'm- Oh.
This is -you-
Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y 'know-y'know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It's here! Yeah, it's right-it's right down here! In the biggest library in the university!
Come on, you-you can 't tell me you actually believe that-that there's a woman inside that cat!
Totally.
I didn't get a cat.
Amazing! Amazing!
No, come on, he doesn't know this stuff. If he knew how you felt.
Pffhah.
Good, you don 't want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you?
No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright. Oh, hey, do you think there's a chance you could fix that radiator now?
Hello!
Whoo!
Ohhh! Put it out!
Not at the concert.
Umm, no.
Now, how will they know if you 're ready?
Are ya?
Really!
Oh, right!
Come on.  I got it.
Oh, yeah, yeah that's Michelle.
Oh!
Yeah.
Wait, wait a minute, there's no light on the back wall! How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello?  Ah, oh, ah!  Ah!  The same thing happened again!
Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is  "if you can't come on time, then don't come at all".  An option that many of my students use.  Shall we?
Were you the ones called the cops?!
Oh! Oh! She 's upside down but she's coming! She's coming!
Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.
Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying  'I'll see you Saturday.'
Walls are pretty thin, guys!
You remember Janice, right?
Why do they keep doing that?
I'm sure he'll understand.
Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids.
I guess if everybody else is...
Anyway.. um..  So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
We live together. You 're having our baby. I'm not gonna see anybody else. Are you-are you sure you don't want something more?
He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
Hey! Hey Adrienne.
No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?
Come on! Come on. Come on.
The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.
Thanks.  OK.
Trying to date this woman.
Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.
Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
Okay Phoebe, I guess you 're next  although I really don't see the point.
Not so good.
Hey Pheebs, what's going on?
I don't want to.
Do you uh, do you talk about me?
Oh. How do you uh, ya know, keep it so neat?
All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex?
Bye.
Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!
Hey, you only heard Monica's side of that. That little fatso was a terror.
Oh, I love that guy!
Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.
No.
Yeah, no one talks like that!
Hey, you 're right.
You'll never get me, Joe!!!
So, you 're saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?
Pants off Bing!
Monica, you 're so lucky! He's like the most popular guy in school!!
Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading?  Pheebs?  Hello?  Phoebe?  Phoe-Phoebe!  Come on!
On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.
Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?
Hey! What's up?
Totally.
Thanks.
Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
now I feel terrible this is all my fault.
I was just outside Barcelona, hiking
Alright you kids, bye now.
Yeah.
He's right, man.
Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.
Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?
That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin.
I 've been back and forth.
Hmm, yeah.  Come on Ross jr. It's time to go in.
I 've got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.
Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?
I am your friend.
Hi.
Smooth man. Yeah, you got some chilie on your neck.  Well, I just want to say, thanks everyone, this- this was great. And hey! See you guys Monday morning.  Thanks Joey.
Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.
Are you serious?
Well
No.
Okay, hopefully this time mom won 't boo you.
They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!
Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting.
Yeah...
Wow, I haven 't seen her for like forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes.
Are you kidding?
She seems really , really fun!
DANGER!!!!
This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
Listen, I um I heard about the engagement.
I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel 's father. Look I I made a mistake, but it's only because I really, really like you. Really!
You know, if it's meant to be, I'll guess it. Bye, bye.
