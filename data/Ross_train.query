Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I 've got to get this order in. Honey, I'm so sorry, but it looks like I'm gonna be here all night.
Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.
It's Richard Burke.
Close call day.
I guess.
Was that Emma? Is she up?
I wish I could.
Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?
Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white.  Nope. Okay, colors that don't work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.
Ross, I am a human doodle!!
I don't think they are.
Because , because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel  was like,  "You are such an idiot!"
Yeah, and you don 't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.
Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
Would you look at them?
Are there anymore from the good batch?  'Cause we could just work off of those.
Yes!  .... or no.
That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge.
No. Here
Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?
You did!
Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch!   And I 'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
Yeah, okay.
I don 't what your talking about.
I'll do it!
Chandler's wearing panties.
So what. So he drank a lot tonight.
No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.
I'm really sorry you guys.
Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.
You 're welcome buddy.
Oh, that's what she meant!  You know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!
Well, let's see. The first one is
W-wait. What is that?
Here?! Now?!
All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.
No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?
Yeah well, maybe she should 've spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.
Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like,  banging his hands together!
I wanna get married
Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
Who?
Why don 't all of you tell me a little about your self?
Oh, for god's sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock!  I'm sorry, was that rude? Di- did my, my li-little outburst blunt  the hideousness  that is this evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didn't even have the courtesy to call.  Well, it's too late now.
What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.
Well, we're not seeing each other, so....
Wow you guys got a hospital?
A pill?
Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either -Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh!  Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.
Ross...
Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.
Oh... uh... look... before you...
I know.
Umm, or , maybe, I should stay away from all men.
Her date tipped me ten dollars.
I I uh, actually just moved from four blocks over.
Okay.
Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a confession to make uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid
No way!
Actually about an hour and a half.
No, no! We made this decision together.
Oh it 's been going on way to long now. Y'know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn't say anything. And then the next time he said, "Hey Toby, do you want a donut?" And I-I wanted a donut. And now it's five years later, the donut's gone and I'm still Toby.
Really? About what?
What are you talking about?
All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.
It's some of Richard's hair!  What do I do with this?
No! No-no. Look, there 's a bug stuck in tar right here.
So? Did you get the annulment?
We 'll take Literature!!
Ugh.
...if you tell me, I might do it.
Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go.  Y'know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just-I don't get Chandler. Y'know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don't get all upset.
Nothing...
Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man.
Then she came back with  "The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"
Please... Chandler is the love of my life... ... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy!
Yeah, yeah, all the time.
It 's not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do  that again.
Whoa-ho.
And then we've gotta get some sleep.
I got it! Mine!
Rossss can!
Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look.
Are you okay?
Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
Look I just thought that...
Thank you.
Ugh. Come on, Mona, don't kiss ass.
Oh God.  No! Oh not again!  This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry.  Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?
Marcel?
Okay, now make it even,  'cause we don't...
Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it?
Okay.
Okay.
I think I need a drink.
She is?
Yeah, what's it about?
Why not?
What?
Hey, buddy.
Umm, hi!
How long has it been since you had sex?
Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
Yeah?
Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat!
Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !
Look, I don't wanna hear this right now.
I 'm not gonna tell you! You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg.
All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.
Oh, I blew it. I wouldn 't of even hired me.
Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.
Hey!
Ross, she 's 25 years old.
Wow!
Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.
You 're right. It was 37.
Any contact?
Yeah.
hmmm...
Interesting.
Call them mom and dad you loser!
Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent.
Five dollars a box.
You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.
Because I need the money, and I thought that it 'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.
Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I don't even know what department that guy's in.
Can I tell you something? Me too.
Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y 'know, I probably wouldn't have to say spank as much.
Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they 're gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.
Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let 's talk about it!! How was she?
We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?
Since when, since when do you think I don 't wear enough of this?
Me too.
What?!
Great.
Oooh, I like that, "daddy"
Okay. Okay. Umm Ooh! Oh-oh, I got something. It's this story I came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; they're like putty.
Ye-ye, we go to yours!
Ross!
Wow! Hey, why are you all dressed up?
Yeah. Salt, so your life always has flavor.
We 've only known each other for six weeks!
Yeah.
You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.
Hey cool, mine too.
Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there 's the added mystery of who gets who.
I 'm not sure yet. Why didn't you just tell me about all this?
Maybe you do that next time you get married!
Oh my God, she's so stupid!
Oh no thanks. I don 't like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
Oh no, I really don 't want any--Oh! Thank you. Oh. Oh Ross
All right.
Wow! How are you?!
Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.
Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him
But your divorce isn't even final yet.
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
Eh, okay, the waiters have a little pool going. We have a bet on how long it'll take before you give up and go home.
That's very funny. We done now?
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt.
-if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.
Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.
I love it!!
Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.
Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.
What's it look like?
Hel-lo, Rachel Green.
And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
So, why did you break up?
I don 't think I'd be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.
Oh, that is so unfortunate.
Argh!
Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica 's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
Well, actually...
Here's your lemonade.
Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.
Guess what? You're almost an uncle!
Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
Well, maybe you didn 't want it to end?
Ooh, I have to go pack.  It really does?
oooh! Oh oh!
Those two only had each other!
I 'll pick it up for you!
Alright. Just give me your wallets and there won't be a problem.
Ross, whose glasses are those?
ah-ha!
When Carol was pregnant with Ben
N-no... uhm... did I buy a falafel from you yesterday?
uhm... Is everything okay?
I cannot believe that you didn 't tell me that we are still married!!
Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that?  Especially you!
Oh great! Thanks Ross, you 're such a good friend!
Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!
Can you please, please take care of it for me?
I 'm sorry, for the last time, why aren't you two together again?  No, I know. I know, because you're not in that place. Which would be fine, except you totally are.
She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?
Ross!
Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can 't work if I'm sick.
I can tell you work out.  A paleontologist who works out, you 're like Indiana Jones.
What are you doing here?
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
Yeah.
Have you guys picked a date yet?
All right, I 'm gonna make more margaritas!
I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.
Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?
Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
Do you want to know?
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
Ross? Let 's go.
Oh good. Now there 'll be someone there who likes my name.
I don't know! I don't remember!
Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them
I 'm good except umm, you still owe me a dance.
That's insane!
No! Y 'know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!
I can 't see it!
Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.
For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.
Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.
Good.
No, no, no, I 'm looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And....  What does it matter, what I'm wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor?  Thank you.  We're holding.
Okay!
Thank you.
G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
Hi!
I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.
Hi you guys!
Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go?
Why are you doing this?
I need to talk to you!
we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So
I know!!   Chip? Hi! It 's Monica.  'Kay.  'Kay.  Okay.  Okay, good-bye.  Oh my God, we just had the best conversation!!
But Ross, Ross. What do you, what do you think she's going to say?
Oh Ross, come on. He's happily married. His wife just had twins.
Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer.
Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.
Yes, absolutely. I'll call him.
No.
Bye.
Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.
The players.
If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.
Thank you.
I love hiking!
Oh wow, it's so beautiful...
Hey.
Fancy guest.
Hi you guys!
Hey!
I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember.
So...
Ooh! Y 'know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
Well, are any of those people here?!
You were gonna propose to me?
Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.
You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here.
I thought... it was wonderful!
OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.
Oh!
I don 't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
Maaaassapequa, sounds like a magical place. Tell me about Massapequa, is it steep in Native American history? {Transcriber 's Note
Ohh, yeah.
I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn 't matter, I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It's so annoying. Does it bug you?
Yeah.
All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.
No! They did!
No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called  "The Days of Our Lives".
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely.
Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
I 'll be back in an hour to check you again.
Where is Emily?
Your son.
I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.
Hey!
Hey!
Ross, get over it! It 's not like she hates you.
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross 's behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back
This could 've been hers!
So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?
Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around.
...Yeah?
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.
Oh, well think of it like this, when you 're 90
My job!
That 's a good call. Right.
That you 're a liar.
Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.
'Tonight' tonight?
Huh?
You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.
Oh, I-I'm just making a list of people's birthdays.
Well okay!
I 'm sorry, what?
Honey, he 's about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn.
Huh.
Yes it is.
Sure.
Oh look! A letter from my mom.
Exactly.
Yeah that would really be great.
So you're really okay with this?
Nothing, I really wanna know.
All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape!
Oh, great! Me too.
Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you 've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
Well then I demand a recount!
It was an amazing night.
Are you serious?
Ross, you should know that my pants are startin ' to come down and I'm not wearing any underwear!
All right -oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I'd really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.
With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
Not using it right, Joe.
The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.
Excuse me? Oh yeah? Well, up yours too!
All right buddy, way to go!
Are they still looking for us?
Hey, you!
You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time.
Hey!
Ross, you need some help?
Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
Ah! The high road...
Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting to realize how much I missed her, and I'm gonna need you to break up with her.
Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
Really?!
So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!
Good day for married people huh?
Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!
Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who ever
I don 't know. Do-do you have any clothes on?
Hey. Whaddya doing?
Come on man, you drove all the way up here.
Yeah? Well you look phenomenal.
Yeah, I do.
So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
Hey!
That was kind of rude!
What?
Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.
Licorice?
You guys, he's beautiful!
But, we are.
Isn't he good?
you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!
Oh, I 'm sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me.
So?
Yeah. You 're right. Hey I-I can do that.
Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you 're right where you don't want to be! Back together!
Sooo!! Anyway...
Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.
Okay.
That was amazing!
Oh hey-hey!
Hey, you got one right!
NO!
Okay.  Oh! A coloring book!
Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn 't shut up.
Hey Phoebe!
A dreamless sleep.
Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.
One Two Three...
I don 't know. Y'know, they didn't get us anything.
No, I knew.
Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?
Again. Y 'know what? I think we all did.
That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.
He's a pretty tough guy to impress.
I don 't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?
Yeah.
Right. No big deal.
Great nap.
No we weren 't! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y 'know, ended up kissing for a bit.
Oh I I think they're funny.
Hello.
Well what is it?!
Oh, I know... I know it's been really hard for you.
That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
All right, you know Paolo?
My due date is in one week!
Ah yeah -wait a second now! Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
The sheep.
I know, I hate being left out of things.
Okay.
Hi!
Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I didn't not say it.
Hi.  Umm, I think there 's something that we really need to talk about.
Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
Hey.
And! And, they 're gonna have a baby!  And! And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus.
Hi! Remember me?
Dr. Geller, will you dance with me?
Hey, hey!
You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all,  "Once a cheater, always a cheater."
Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy 's theory. Okay?
Yeah you do!
Come on! You like this woman, right?
New people.
I know. I 'm sorry. Look, I'll make a deal with you all right? Okay?
So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she 's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, "I take thee circus freak." Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?
What?!
Would you like a lollypop?
...and I was wondering if... you know, maybe one of you guys...
No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.
Ross, where are you going?
Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?
I mean I got news for you mister, Emma?
You know, actually I'm a little surprised to myself. I mean, Joey is so different from the guys I usually date. I mean, they're all professors, and intellectuals, and paleontologists mostly, you know, very cerebral...
It 'll be great for next weekend. I mean,  it'll be grrreat.
No, you know what, it's late, everything's gonna be closed. Why don't we just do it another night?
Oh my God, what!?
You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody.
Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.
Ross!
Yeah, yeah.
Actually, it 's kinda my fault. I-I quit today.
Actually, I'm kinda happy to be leaving... I just broke up with someeone.
Oh-oh!
Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?

I don 't know. Could be because I don't feel like standing around all night waiting for some guy who may or may not scream.
Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.
What are you doing?
You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl.
Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We know what 's gonna work! It's doctor recommended!
I don 't think you did a very thorough job!
No suds, no save. Ok?
Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers.  Okay, I'm late for work.
You got a little bored?
All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean...
You! It 's not like it's a big deal! You-you don't still do it or anything!
Oh right, uhm, Don?
He 's perfect, he's never been better.
Oh, yes Elizabeth. Ah, 871.
Okay.  But it is officially nighttime.
Yeah.
Hi.
Ross!
Hey!
Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel 's not in the same place you are.
We want the last six years back!!
Uhhhooo.
Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
Yes.
Oh?
No, no, it's just that it's getting late...
Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes
All right!
Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I've been looking for you everywhere!
No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!
I 'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
I'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts...
We 're gonna pick up the wedding dress then we're gonna have lunch with mom.
Marriage advice? Really?!
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
I'm not mad.
Oh, I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable?
Hey!
Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?
I don 't have ten minutes!!
Uh-huh!
Joey! You 're doing great!
So, you know... I have a little time. If you... if you want to...
Do you all promise?
Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...
Well, that's what we said about Joey...
What kinda noise?
We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this
M-M-Mole people?
And anyhow, I 'm sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to understand that I  still look at Lizzie like she's a twelve-year-old girl.
Yeah! I 'm gonna have a boyfriend, you're gonna have a girlfriend
Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.
Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.
I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it.
Oh, hi. I'm professor Wealer.
Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.
"Big guy?"
So, did you two have fun?
Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
I feel like I owe you an explanation. I don't ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. I'm... well, I'm kind of embarrassed. I really hope you don't think less of me.
She 's okay with Rachel and the baby?
Okay fine, now Ross
Yeah.
It's a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back to your apartment?
What?
How late are we?
Namaste.
Ross of.....
Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more!
I don't know...
Too?
No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not worth it.
Y'know I can 't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
I think so.
Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!
Dead leg!!
Oops sorry, my mistake.
Hey.
Hey.
That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!
But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had.
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?
No. But I remember people telling me about it.
Don 't try to sway her.   I'm your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let's go.
Ross?
That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.
You know what? I've been thinking about it. I'm really coming around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that.
I know, I get it, but Mona, what relationship is not complicated? I mean we all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single?  I am so gonna leave right now.
Okay Ross, why don 't you come with me?
All right.  Fine.
Ah, there we go.
Okay, in about ten seconds you 're gonna see him kiss me.
Oh, yeah, right. There was a break-in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey was taken.
Well, he 's not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with him-He says it's okay.  Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!
Phoebe?! Wait a -but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.
Yeah. So, do you want to give a check? Or
Really?
No, I-I haven 't seen your pink shirt.
PHD
Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or Phoebe?
Like asking her to move in with you?
I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.
You fell asleep?!
Yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35 th wedding anniversary, I had a star named after them.
Alright, you know what? That 's it. You've had your chance.
What did I just say?
Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.
Hey, Ross!  I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second?
Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that.
Oh that 's all right, I'm coming back later with your father.
All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
Yes it is!
Ooh! That 's good! Wow! But now if you were pregnant, what would you name it? Hint
I can see the headline now
"Gimme your money, punk!"
So you do know who he is!  Sorry.
Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?
So, so is she still going to Paris?
We appear to have angered it.
owwwww...
We 're at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?
No, I 'm still going.
I have quarters!
Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant.  All right, so I don 't know what sycophant means, but the rest is right.
Hey!
Hey guys!
Ross, can I?
Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you 're doing frat guys.
No. But that reminds me,  sign this.
Jingle bells, jingle bells...
Hey, you listen.
Why would you serve food on such a sharp stick?
What?
Yeah, where were you!
Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y 'know what? I'll-I'll come back later.
What happened son?
No.
Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him.
Thanks.
That 's it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you.
Oh, tell me about it. And she 's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
So you 've just married the one time then?
Well, thanks for the books.
I understand...
Umm, yeah.
Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...
Hi!
What did he say?
Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh....  Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.
Son, I had to shave my ears for tonight. You can do this.
Wow, that is tempting.
You wanna dance?
Oh...
What?
He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.
Yeah that 's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about!
Yeah, I'm her date.
You weren't there!
Hey, it 's the dinosaur guy.  Hi, Ross.
Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.
And the fact that they're both monkeys.
What?
Any minute now.
What?
Almost time for cake.
Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson.
That 's so great for you guys!
What happened in Atlantic City?!
Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.
Look at her, my first grandchild.
Yay!
There y'go. Ross?
Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!
You did a bad thing!
Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?
No! No. They 're umm They're just uh ground beef smileys.
I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I-
Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I 'm looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!
What about that circled one?
I do.
Hey, all right!
Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!
Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex.
Can I use your phone?  Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
Right. So, it'll be the same except less sex with you.
So how did everything go?
Joey he's not even thinking about going after Rachel!
Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off.
Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly.  Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!
Noted.
Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don 't qualify for an annulment. If you two don't want to be together you'll have to file for divorce.
Hey, how was class?
Y 'know, dirty talk, mÃÃ©nage ÃÃ  trois, toys
Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.
No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?
Yeah okay. Well, what 's the next little bit?
Hi!
And after that, what could I do except become a chef.
Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself!?
Yeah, and not a very good one.
I think you 've got concussion.
Ok. If you really need to.
She is good!
Oh, Rachel!
Hi.
Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on!  No! Not in there! He 's in there!
All right, I trust you.
Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.
Did you not understand the story?
whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!
Bye.
Yeah! I'll cook!
Rosssss can!
Did Rachel find you?
Yeah, if you 're going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area.
You 're not going to say anything? On our 35th wedding anniversary
Y 'know, you look nothing like I would've thought. You're you're so young.
Hey you guys!
Some guy, Tom Gordon.
Oh, Ross, you gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalogue.
Uh-huh.  Y 'know what I was, I was thinking about?
Oops! I did not mean to run into you like that sir.
Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either.
Now I love you. And not just 'cause I have to.
So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you 're, you're, you're making this too hard.
Hi.
Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?
Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?
That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout,  "I will be revenged?!"
All right.
Okay fine, what do you have?
You mean the lully story?
Oh really? That 's how treat a friend? You get her in trouble and then refuse to marry her?
We were out of Doritos.
Dr. Geller?
Sure. What's up?
Oh please. Okay, anyone in this room think that I would send Ross begging symbols, please show of hands.
Radiator.
Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
Monica did it?
What 's fish hooking?
All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily!  That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
So, you feel like a dad yet?
Hi, sweetie!
Does anybody want anything else?
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
Yeah!
And who may I say is calling?
Alright, okay, okay, gleba, gleba...  Gleba! Ha! Here it is
And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything.
And yet, she 's still not hanging up the phone.
What?!
Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on.
Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do.
Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.
Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'
Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
Ross, there he is.
I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
Just get out! Now!!
She laughed at you?
No!
Oh! I knew it! What happened?
Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.
Sure! That would be nice.
And this- is my reward!
No, everything 's fine. I just gotta go back
What were you doing?
That's what it says here. Flight 421, leaves at 8
I remember your first birthday! Ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you. He pulled on his testicles so hard! We had to take him to the emergency room!
Woah, dude, burn.
Yeah!
So!   How 's the library?
Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
Hang in there. You hang in there.
Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
Hey Pheebs!  Hey!
Okay.
Oh my God! Who 's gonna watch that?!
Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.
I didn't!
Oh my God! Oh my God! I 'm so sorry!
Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie!
Push, push!
No.
You're kiddin'.
Oh, wait-wait-wait
Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
Yeah, sure.
Okay, thank you.  It's the Italian Hand- Licker, isn't it.
Yeah.
Hey, tell Dan,  'Thanks.'
Because the winner gets this!
Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good.
Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get over her.
Why aren 't you moving your feet?
I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.
Full house.
Oh that's mine too!  I'm Italian!
Well, there's you.
Yeah.
It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York , and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.
Hey.
She said,  "He's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl."
Nope.
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
Aw honey stop! It 's not that bad.
Ross, please, don't be so scared of him!
We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!
Well, can I talk to you for a sec?
All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?
Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!
Y 'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
Hey, guys.
Enter Amy!
5 6 7 8!
I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.
Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman, our 50-year-old librarian.
Oh my God!
You mean there's more than one of us.
Damnit!! Did you move?!
Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?
Oww!
Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
I 'm sorry, you're right. What am I gonna say?  Oh!
You 're no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole.
Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
Me too.
I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.
Oh-hooo, I missed you.
Well, whatever works for ya
It's not just that she's cute, okay. It's just that... she's really really cute.
It's seven years ago.  My time machine works!
Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet!
Noo.
Because it says  "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?
'Kay!
Okay!
Okay. I 'm going with you.
So how'd it go?
Ow!
Fourth gear!!
Isn't that cute?
Honey I swear it we just kissed.
So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?
Do I still call you Ross?
Oh my God.
Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y 'know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
Great.
Oh-ho-ho, we 've got company.
Spring vacation.
You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.
Well, who wouldn 't?!
Hey umm, you brought protection right?
Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.
Oh come on!!
Oh yeah.
Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say.
Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say,  "Hmm, noodle soup."
Who's your friend? He's hot!
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing. He can't quite say mama yet, but once he said yumen.
No, I'm getting it. I'll be right back.
Oh, yeah, that's true.
He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!
I believe you know my husband.
Well what is it? What is it? If it 's gonna help bring the baby here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.
Who are those people?
Yeah, oh I 'm sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya, it's a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I'm so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, 'cause-Oh! I'm pregnant!
Oh yeah! Hey, save the cork and then we can fill the bottle with water and put it back so they don't charge you.
No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
YES!
Yeah. Y 'know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don't you think it's gonna be weird?
Oh please God, let there be a song.
Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!
Yeah.
It's a...
Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?
Too strong for me?
You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!
No it is awesome!
Hi.
Ohh, get these things out of me!
But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Nope! I can do this all day.
All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!
Y 'know what? This is not fair to her. Let's just forget the tape!
I 'm sorry.
Oh no, she 's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her.
This is ridiculous.
Yeah, but, there were no suds.
Are you asking permission to break the pact?
Well, y 'know what? Thanks to you I'm half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I don't think I have ever been this angry!
Hi.
Okay.
Why?
Ross, cough drops, please?
It's locked.
We don 't make enough fun of you already?
Aww, Rach, I think you look cute  And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon .
You might wanna get back in there.
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.
Not if you were here.
No, no, no, no!
Now umm, remember I 'm still learning.
Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!
You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?
C'mon!
Flowers, liquor, recarpet first floor. New guest bath, landscaping. I'm paying to remodel this guys house.  I'm going to give that son on a bitch, a piece of my mind.
Y'know I can 't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.
Oh thank you.
Occupation? Dinosaurs.
Hey!
Joey cracks me up! It's like, 'Yeah, why don't you have your ex-wife move in with you? That wouldn't be awkward at all!'
Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.
Oh, I really liked him.  Yeah, it was really, really, really good.
Oh my God!!
Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?
Yes! And while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of issues...
Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!
I packed while you were gone. I left some knickers under your pillow.
So, we 're having fun, right?
Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it. That is
So you can like, bite, and pull people 's hair and stuff?
Maybe.
Oh my God!
I don't think so.
No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real?  Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.
Oh.
So you don 't have the cameras?!
Hey, look, you guys, I'm going for anything here, OK? I cannot be a waitress anymore, I mean it. I'm sick of the lousy tips, I'm sick of being called 'Excuse me...'
Rust, is boat cancer, Ross.
Aaah.
Our table will be ready in a couple minutes.
Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex?
Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?
Great. That would be fine.
You're right.
Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?
Why?
So, how many have you sold so far?
Here you go!
What?!
Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.
Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
Yeah, I-I can 't-I mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just-I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I
Hey!
So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?
Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!
Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!
Whoa-oh, what's-what's that?
Really?
Wow, so your child is a big fan of the Waldo books too?
Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?
Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?
Oh! Okay!  You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me!
All-all right!  Start it up! Let 's go!
You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.
I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
Oh my God. You and Rachel?
Oh...  Well...
Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
No wonder your pregnant.
Hey there, you handsome thing.
OK, hi again.
Yeah, maybe if you 're in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are we?
This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!
Well, it 's time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
Or ya know, he's rubber and you're glue.
I wasn 't invited.
Oh my God. You 're even dumber than I am!
Don 't do this to me, again. You'd know I'd stay here in a minute, but I'd really miss so much work, they'll fire me.
Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.
Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!
Ross, they are killing you out there!
Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine.  Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor
Hey!
Well, you know, no suds, no save.
I could die.
He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh,  "Yeah, I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch."
Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again!
You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!
Yes!
Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it.  I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't.  Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!
Oh, come on, miss, isn't there any way that you can just let me off...
All I 'm saying is, it's one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don't know, like a  surprise!!
I don 't know, you thought 'See you Saturday' was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
No, it's you!
That 's funny.
She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant.
And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
So, I gotta get going.
Oh my God Ross! What in heaven 's name are you doing here?
Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can 't get mad.
All right well, y 'know I guess we know what we have to do to get down.
You and Rachel.
Mornin '
Well, the turkey's burnt.  Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
You know, I really don't feel very comfortable making this decision. You know, Phoebe knows you better, I'm gonna let her choose.
Oh I 'd like that.
Yeah?
You don't think my mom's sexy?
Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you  'cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don't punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.
I don 't want him to tell this story for years.
Ross, don't let her drink anymore!
Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?
Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?
Hey.
Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.
Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were!
It 's perfect.
Maurice.
Pulling what? It 's second down.
Hey hey, come on in!
Why not?
Guess what?
Yeah, maybe...
Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y 'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too.
Great!
I'm sorry, what did you just say? Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben just said 'Hi'.
You can 't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So...
Do you love her?
But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
I like those odds!
Ok.
Hi Ross! You ready for breakfast?
Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?
Chip! Hi, it 's Rachel.  Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message.  Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down.  Monica Geller.  Ohh.
Do you know where the store is?
Look Ross, if you 're so freaked out, just get in the car!
Hi.
What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y 'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover.
Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
All right! All right! Uh, umm, Super-Speedy Speed round!
Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I 've missed the last 1200 times.
Okay, y 'know what? Can I, can I talk now?
In a minute!!!
Yeah right!
Good. How are you?
Yeah.
Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the...
Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?
And that's not all I'm allergic to.
She 's right.
Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.
It's never gonna happen.
I do love Mike.
I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were-you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut.
Okay, hating this.
Me too.
We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.
Okay you have to realize, I was exhausted, I was emotional, I would have said yes to anybody. Like that time you and I got married!  I 'm not helping.
Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter 's machine!!
Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.
Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!
Oh no, I can 't. I got a date.
Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.
Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.
Hm-mmm.
Did we not make ourselves clear the other day.
Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning!
Do you think that 's something that he'd be mad at you for?
Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.
Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh...
What happened to your teeth.
Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
Thanks sweetie.
Well, how you died was funny.
Yes.
My God!
Hello?
Damnit Ross, get your butt out of the bathroom.
I did.
Huh. Nice to meet you. I 'll get started on this.
Do you two know each other?
I can see it now,  "Look dad, it's the Sphinx!"
Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!
I have absolutely no idea.
Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto.
Okay, here comes another camera.
I understand, separation is hard. One time I was about to leave Ross to go to the beauty parlor and he got so upset, he took off all his clothes, tucked his ??? between his legs and cried out
I 'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone.
You said I was boring--Ohh!
Ok. So now, I think Emma is probably down for the night, but if you need anything Ross . . .
Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.
Yeah, no, me neither.
Oh, I love you too. But...
Remind me to introduce you to someone!
Oh.
Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
I know, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great...
You got married to fast.
Can we come in?
My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
Ross, you 're being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.
Hey uh, what 's with the candy?
I think you should go.
All right, so, so you went to Pete 's...
I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
What?
Oh God!
So we are going on two?
I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
No.
Oh yeah, that 's right, the keyboards, huh?
Say it!
Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but
Not a one.
Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.
Are you sure?
Wow! That 's great! Dad must really like you, he doesn't ask just anyone to play.
It's so... something... You go girlfriend!
Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I 'm related to Monica. How is she?
We're uh, we're getting married.
God! Ross!
Are you yelling at me?!
Cappuccino.
Hi
Rachel!! Open up!! It's your sister!!  I have to talk to you!!
Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?
Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean y 'know, emotionally, mentally, physically
Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke.
I know I didn 't do well on my midterms and stuff but, I was kinda hoping you could change my grade.
How many you want?
Oh my God!
Hi!
Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed.
You WHAT? And I missed it? Because I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?
Oh, hi sweetie.
What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn 't want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.
I 'll go.
So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y 'know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.
Oh yeah, that 's just a little something for my huge gay fan base.
Don 't worry about it Pheebs.
Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I 've got a deadline, would you just go home, I'll talk to you later.
Come on guys! Let 's go! Come on, it's second down.
I don't see her.
I don't have her number, butt-munch.
Hap.. Hap.. Happy Thanksgiving.
Dealer takes two.  What do you bet?
Oh y 'know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
Yeah!
You know, he was just doing his job...
Hey, maybe that's for the best.
I think she's OK.
Maybe you should put it off.
Fine, whatever.
The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice.
A lot.
Okay that 's the green stuff talkin'.
Oh, slides.  So really nothing happened.
They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.
Yeah, isn 't that a cool name?
Y 'know what Ross? I'm not gonna let you get away with this!
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I 'm gonna go to the bathroom.
NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that.
Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
Say 200?
Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.
How, how is this my fault?
Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said
Well, maybe it was God, doing me.
What? We could do it!
Oh-no, y 'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night!
Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay?
Or, or the rodeo!!
Thank you.
Uhuh.
Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
Hey!
All right.
OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
Hey!
Hey.
Woo-hoo!!
I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
I usually prefer Elizabeth 's boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens.
Good luck, with your girlfriend.
Honey, I'm just checking.
Yes.
Hi!
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.
Oh Maria. You can 't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym treat.
Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.
Stop what?!
Awesome, the name really stands out.
O-kay!! See what you did, I 'm gonna be doing it by myself now. Okay?
Oh, she sees him! Oh, they 're hugging!
Hi.
Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.  Dirk, this is my good friend Ross.
That would be great!
So shake it!
Uh, good.
Alright.
Yeah, yeah. It 's like my chance to give something back to the acting community.
Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God.
I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!
Hey look Ross, you need to understand something okay? I uh I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you.
What?!
Ohhhh!
She puts the key into the ignition, which is on the left side of the steering wheel. Does anyone know why that is? It's a tradition left over from Porsche's racing history. The world's greatest endurance race is the 24 Hours of LeMans. Which is in France and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on Saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on Sunday.  In the 60s LeMans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track. At the start of the race, the drivers would run across the track, get in the car, buckle up, start the car, and drive off. Porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took. Since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel, that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat-belts, put the car in gear and start it. The driver's left hand did nothing. Porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24-hour race; moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat-belts with his right hand. That's why every Porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel.}
Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...
What's going on?
Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
Yes! And that 's why I'm under the table. Celebrating.
Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,
Okay. Hey -Ooh, cool sheets!
Wow!
Okay, I 'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.
The diapers?
Ross you 're not listening to me, I don't have time to stop.
Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.
And! She uses sex as a weapon!
Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
Right.
Hey!
Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?
You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!
Oh I get it! A man duh!
Your work makes me sad.
I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass.
Dr. Geller!
Oh, hi Ross!
Well, he 's never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!
They were lovers.
Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.
Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass!
So y 'know Ross it's funny 'cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?
Wait a minute, y 'know, you're bringing me!
Well, aren't we Mr.  "The glass is half empty."
Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's still heavily sedated.
You gave her a key to your apartment?!
This is what I 've got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.
But I couldn't even if I wanted to, because I don't know! I swear; I didn't see anything, and I don't want to know! It was just a momentary lapse.
Oh my How much do you weigh Ross?!
So, you're a paleontologist, right?
Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
Hey-hey!
Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?
I don 't know. Is it crazy?
Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they 're all gonna' make fun of her, do you want that?
Y 'know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through.
Oh yeah? Fine.
I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.
Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
Oh, it 's the best!  So, umm how's Monica?
Are you sure?
What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I 'm not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can't go if I break my leg.
Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don 't think that's just a little funny?!
Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
Hey! Did you find the cameras?
Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.
Um... Ross?
You don't like ice cream?
What're you doing?
Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about.  Hey.
Wait, am I missing something though?  'Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way.
Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you 're not gonna come with me?
Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.
Oh, ah- the kid has it.
What?
Well, just shimmy down me and drop!
Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe 's song about?
I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don 't think your son will think it's yours and be horribly traumatised?
I see where you 're goin'!
I still haven 't gotten a check for your half yet.
Huh umm
I know!
Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?
I know, I know, I know, I know. I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I'm good, I'm not gonna laugh anymore. OK put your hands back there.
Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it 'd be really good.
Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!
No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
All right! Just hurry up!
Oh, that would be great!  I love him, I love him, I love him...
No way!
By me?
Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job description.
Excuse me?
Really?
Face to face, yeah!
Are you, are you, are you sure it 's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that.
Are you close with her?
When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy...
No.
It 's just some things I've been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
Hey, your English is getting better!!
God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!
We were on a break!
What?!!
Oh-oh, that 's your thing.
Yeah.
Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to Hi!
Hmm.
Hi.
Congratulations! Wow!!
I've come here to apologize. I think I may have let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process.
Ross! Y 'know what, I just got-why? Why did you do this?!
No, I know, I know, that this is Frank 's life,  y'know. Y'know, I don't want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it's sick and wrong!
How 'd the lecture go?
How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
Right. Wow!
Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
Oh! Oh!
Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.
Okay.
Hello.
Hi! My boss let me off early, so I took the train.
Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.
Uh You didn 't propose to me, Chandler didn't propose to me, but Joey did.
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you 're, you're, you're making this too hard.
Look at this, how did I spend so much money?
Potassium.
You want my advice?
What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
What? They will be!
Saraaah.
Not to mention the cold sores.
Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
Yeah.
Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!
Same category?
Wow, that's pretty cool
Yeah, in a poem maybe.
...love you.
It's me!
Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?
When is Santa coming?
I 'll never get to be a best man!
Don 't call us that!
Oh, so everything's okay?
So you're up for keynote speaker! Who's making the decisions?
You got it!
A ten speed bike. But, I 'd rather have something my Dad couldn't sell.
Ross, it 's not that big a deal! So you'll been divorced three times, you'll still have a life, you'll go on dates
Well sure, if you say you 're gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms!  All right, now I'm gonna do this my way and I don't want to hear a peep out of you!
Oh my god, I left the water running.
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.
Yes, and now he 's using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say,  "Well done!" Bravo Meg.
Dude, if you go back out there, you 're gonna be Dead Ross!
Now, does it really matter?
All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can 't believe I screwed this up!
I was trying to help out a squirrel.
No, no, this is not what I ordered. Ok? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for my daughter 's birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now!
Well, Kathy 's last boyfriend was Joey.
Wow! I can 't believe that's our baby.
We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.
Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
Ross, it 's going to be okay. I'm not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us.
I 'm pressing, a policeman is on his way.
Uh, I think he 's in Rachel's room. See ya.
Why would you even want to come Ross? You 're a horrible skier.
Score! Where are the disposable cameras?
Well, please welcome... The Snufflebumps... Who wants to be mr. Wigglemunch and who's gonna be the Grumpus?
Look at you. All jealous.
Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
It 's a different guy!
No. That 's not what I'm saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.
The other us.
You know, I can't tell it again...
Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.
Hey guys.
Seriously, what is she doing?
Hi!
Yay! It 's so exciting! Wow, you could've done that with us there.
Oh, you 're totally welcome! What'd she say?
You want some?!
Oh my God.
No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!
Why don't you take Ross?
One, two, three, four!
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?
What?!!
Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me.
Oh God. I'm so sorry.
Yeah, well, I couldn 't find any cards, so it was either this or Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff.
What are you supposed to be?
You do know that Wham broke up?
Because I'm very happy for him!  And you , you lucky dog!
Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.
Correct again! But, you forgot to switch legs between questions, so no hopping bonus!
Hey!
Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.
Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.
Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.
Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-... Hey sailor.
Oh the humanity.
Who?
Well, I don 't know!!
Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.
All right. Have you said,  "I love you?" You could say, I love you.
Me and Ross.
Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I can -you have so crossed a line.
SURPRISE!!!
Hey Rach, hey you.
Sometimes we were.
Well, I don 't know. Are you a masseur?
I just had a rough night.
They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?
You did a good thing today.
So, I think you 're boxes are over here.
Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can't believe he would do this to Monica!
What?
Miss? Are you boarding the plane?
Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.
That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
You mean, you mean 30 days?
Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this...  HUGE engagement ring!
All right look, Ross, he 's right. Emily's great, she's great! But this way too soon, you're only gonna scare her!
Rachel!
Last night.
Please, I think you know why.
Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.
Could've been a peach.
I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.
Yeah, I 'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
Hey, y 'know what? I was wrong.
Hey, for what it 's worth, with Rachel I don't think you'll ever be just  "anybody."
Then why do you ask?!
Ohh, it 's time to go.
This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.
Hey!
Oh.
Are you guys gonna be okay?
Am I in it?
Hey, don't get religious on me, ok.  A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here sit down.  Ready?  Ahh!!  Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!
What'd you do, dip it in sugar?
Dude! He's right there!
Oh hey, don 't worry about it man. Don't worry about it, no big deal.
Yes dear.
Take the top down did ya?
How does she do that?
Yeah.
Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentine's Day.
Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.
Give her some money.
Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
Oh, some guy she met at the movies.
Hey.
Hey, cheer up! You 're gonna see her again, right?
How are you?
Well I don 't know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could
Hey, whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me. Y'know, actually once-once I got dumped during sex.
Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit was later covered by a popular British invasion band?
Hey! I missed you.
She really said that?
Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!

What was that?
Okay. Now you 're gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story.
Rachel's not here.
I 'll get our seats.
What was it?
Well, I did and it hurt.  That's when I wrote the song
Then we agree?
Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like this
Man, this sucks! Y 'know if Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who's gonna be the losers then?
Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you 'd be out partying with Gandel-worf.
You are going downer!
Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.
See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.
Oh come on Ross, we 've done it before we'll do it again, it'll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.
I have a gun
Yeah well, we 'll see.
Well, actually it...
Why are you being weird?
Which do I like?
Oh yeah, I 'd actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea.
Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.

No, I sat in the paint.
So, you just let her go?
I think she would like that.
So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
You've got to face the red light. When the red light goes on the spraying is about to start so close your eyes. When the spraying stops, count to five. Pat yourself down to avoid drip marks then turn around so we can get your back. Got it?
Ahh, then you have to give us the lawn ornaments.
Ross, we we have to be strong. Okay, I-I'm gonna go.  Can I? To remember you?
Were both of those Joey?
He started it!
Who?
All right you two, I 'm gonna get going.
I wanna quit the gym.
Ross, you don't know that.
Shake that nasty butt...
Really?
Honey, I don 't think that's something we need to worry about! First of all he's-he's never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how she'd react.
All right!
No, it's just... I was enganged to a guy who turned out to be gay!
Come on Ben.
No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y 'know, for like two hours, and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.
Come on!
What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?
Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don 't wanna have to have a separate room for you too!!
Wh-what 's that?
Ross, I swear, I don't know.
Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.
Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.
Yeah.
Oh no-no-no, it 's only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.
Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!
Do you want me to pick you?!
Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with it...
Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, and -oh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!
Ain't that bad yet, but it keeps getting darker for the next four hours.
Yeah.
Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!!  Huh.
Why don 't we what?
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't . . . I don't really like to talk about it.
Oh, let's not tell this story.
Hi you. I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.
Oh no-no, I-I had my eyes closed so I could concentrate and y 'know take it all in.
Oooh... I really can't hear what she says come here.
Really? But I 'm being so unreasonable.
Yeah?  Hi!
Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?
I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she 's gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.
What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
....with??
Ross, it's just a sandwich!
She's got her cell, you could call her.
Oh yeah? Okay.
Ah yeah, sorry about that.
Maybe we can like go to a movie or something.
Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!
I 'm sorry, I'm with a client right now.
Really?!
Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!
Okay.
Hey.
Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight.
...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
Ya know, I'm going to take off.
Yeah, there you go!
Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi.
Okay, all right, this is how it 's going to work. We're gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.
Or Carol! But they 're funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
We 're really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
I'm just cleaning up.
You can say that because she's not your mom.
I have to! Okay? It's time!  Okay, I hate dogs.
Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I 'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game.
Eww!!
Chandler!
No.
Y 'know, you are 12 years older than her.
Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
You think about stuff like that?
You've being seeing someone?
Oh my God! My dog died!
Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little?
Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.
Oh hello Ross, where have you been?
Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!
Hey. Whoa, hey, you've been working out, huh?
The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
Okay, even this is turning me on!
So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?
No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go.
Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
Yes you did, gleba is a word!
And everybody has to wear costumes.  Come on! It'll be fun!
Alright, I can't, I can't wait that long. You have to do something-knock that door down!
So it 's okay to date a student.
You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
I 'm Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.
Good!
Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid -Op! Op!
So would I. You wouldn 't think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.
I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.
Okay, well, my cell phone number is right here on the counter, please help yourself to anything in the fridge.
Regular Celery!  Oh, I already have that.
Ross, that was 16 years ago!
Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
I don 't know, what's a koondis with you?  Please, lie down! I've got a sav that oughta shrink that right up.
Noo! I 'll stay. He's my brother.
Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.
Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.
I'm not gonna gooo.
I 'm just visiting my good friend Carol.
Goodnight.
Together?
No, look, I don 't know what else to do. I said I'm sorry!
Yeah, maybe.
Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?
Right!
Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it.
Yeah. That's okay, right?
Wait you stole those from these people 's wedding?
Thank you.
You?
Fine.  Hi! Yes, I 'd like to order a large pizza.
Oooh.
So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.
Well honey, what about you?
If anyone asks, we 'll just say Ben addressed them.  Oh! So you invited Rachel then?
Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.
Ninety percent of a women 's pheromones come out the top of her head! That's why, that's why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them!  Oh come on Ross, you're a scientist.
Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
I 'm ready!
Y 'know, every year I say I'm gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it. Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?
Okay! I was thinking if it's a girl, how about Sandrine? It's French.
So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
Oh.
Oh, there 's no such thing as an innocent burger.
Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I don 't
No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!
Were you guys making fun of Parker?
Why?!
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
Got stood up, huh?
Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous!
Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.
Hey, what are you doing here?
No, he was this creepy guy from high school who had this huge crush on her since like the ninth grade.
What's with all the bottles of liquor?
Yep!
Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?
Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section
You!
We 're getting married!
Ross, we're kind of in the middle of diner here.
Watching ballroom dancing?
That was her.
Who wrote it?
All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!
You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
We don 't have to.
Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
Hey!  Hey!
All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun!
Did you cut this couch in half?
Sorry. You look good too.
God, he's good.
Oh, the guys are here.
Oh,   "you do, do you"?
What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there  and pretend you 're a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!!
What? When was this?
Oops.
What?
What?!!
Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.
So, what'd you tell him?
I wanna sleep, I wanna eat, I wanna take a shower, I mean before she wakes up and we gotta do this all over again.
All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris.
Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
Professor Geller?
You had to ask.
I'm sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but this has been lovely.
Really?
Yeah but you don 't need--What is this?
I'm kidding!
Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.
Puerto Rican.
Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!
Oh, about five minutes. Right now they 're interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
Hey.
No, let me finish.
Wait a second, I could star in it!
I 'm here!
Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!
And who laminated it?
Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
Yeah.
Well, yeah.
What?!
Ohh! Ew!
You fell asleep?!
You 've been married twice?
Great nap.
I 'm not even I'm not even
Or! You can just, y 'know
I didn't get it.
Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt,  and I think my testacles may be in here too.
Hi, honey.
No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her body is soo...
I was not ready for this today!
Between you and
Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how 's it going with her?
Thank you, thank you very much. If everyone will please take your seats, dinner will be served.
All right, well finish your coffee; let 's go.
Pizza delivery!
Elizabeth!
Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.
You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.
Tuesday.
No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.
Jacket now.
Ross...
Uh-huh.
Thank you so much.

Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.
What is this? What are we doing?
But you know what might really cheer me up?
Thanks.
Hey! Look, if it didn 't work it's because you didn't tell it right! Show me how you did it.
So, did you talk to Joey?
Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!
Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That 's not the reason she's not inviting me!
Uh, Ross.
Don 't you point your pants at me!  We have no choice! Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about.
Just a job!
I mean don 't you trust her?
'.... Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '
So you still hadn't heard from Emily?
Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are we going to do?
Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll take this. Excuse me.
What?
Ross, you remember Susan.
Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
What did, what did he say?
Me too. Alright, whattaya got.
Y'know what? I 'll think you'll play.
Okay, he's a senior in college.
Ah... Well, obviously I think so too.
What's going on?
Wow, that's a big cable bill! Huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn on a Saturday afternoon?!  I was in the house!
Sarah.
Have you been working out?
No!
I mean this is so great! We 're gonna be baby buddies!
Okay.
Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!
Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!
Oh yeah.
Hey.
Mr. and Mrs. Bing!
Of course they 're listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
Oh, good.
Well who would?
Oh, yeah.
Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.
Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.
Why?!!
Sandy made Madeleines.
Hey.
Noo! Maybe! I, I don 't know.
I'd love to!
Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!
I gotta make up the guest bedroom.  Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.
Did they just kill off Joey?
Really?
Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the way there's no law against. And then we're gonna grab some food, so if you want...
Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I 'm funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now I'm telling you, I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore.
What's the matter with Rog?
Uh, actually, that's..
Hi! Oh, I 'm so glad you called.
Wait, how long?
Eight whole days.
You're married more than once?
Nooo!
We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. .
It's hard isn't it? There's almost no time for a social life. I mean, where are you gonna meet someone?
The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?
Hi Dr. Long, how are you?
Totally and completely healthy!
Seriously dude, 3 years ago.
No, she left a message.   But it-it kinda got erased. There's just  something wrong with your machine.
Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....
HI!! Hi!
Ross, I hated you when we were kids.
You do?
All right, let 's be practical, if Ross isn't willing to do it, he's not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow Chandler-Chandler is good!
I can 't let him go out that way, he's got a meeting.  You've got something here on your back.
What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.
Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me?
Well, I 'm ready to get the hell out of here!  Oh. Are you? Are you?!!  Ohh! That's so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie.  But for you, yay! Ohh.
Hey.
I can 't. I'm busy. I'm apartment hunting.
Now, do you think it should say,  "Love Ross and Mona?"
You're right, by saying "nice" I'm virtually licking her.
I thought he was with you.
That's a two line part.
Yeah, definitely!
That is wild.
Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?
Ross.
All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!
Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second.
Yeah.
Hey!
So you guys go, have a really good time.
I was not and oh God, shh!
Hey!
Robert 's coming out.
Yeah, like in a cab...
So, he's on the show, he knows what happens.
YES!!
No, go ahead.
Oh sure, we should see results -Whoa!! Clearly not the way to go!!
What?
And y 'know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club!
Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . .
Y'know what? That's okay, you guys have ordered so many that this one is on me!
Namaste.
Okay.  Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That 's great!
I can 't believe you're getting married!
Yeah, love. It 's a tricky business isn't it?
Us, what about you guys? Man you really, bing, gave it to old Mr. Clean back there. He was a big guy.
Yeah, he's the best.
well it was awful every time I thought about what you said I started crying.
Yeah! C'mon!
Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!
The lights, please..
Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
Can we talk to you for just a y 'know It's just a little thing. Well we think it's absolutely marvelous that you're having this baby out of wedlock, some of our friends are less open-minded. Which is why we've told them all that you're married.
What-what's going on?!
No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.
That 's a bad duck!!!  How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?
That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?
Oh no, you're the best.
To be fair this one does have nuts.
Oo, where are the seats?
Dangerous Liaisons.
Ugh, is she pregnant yet? She doesn 't need to be; she'll still have the baby before I do. Oh Ross, another contraction!
Okay. Thank you. That 's great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west 10th? Because there's this really cute shoe store that has like this little
I don 't like you going out with my daughter Ross.
Come on Ross, you 're a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.
No.
So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
Oh, look at the little cat!
Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'
What do you mean?
Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther don 't-don't forget your shirt.
What'cha gonna' do?
A woman in a man 's body.
Ring dammit, ring!
This is just occurring to you?
When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.
Hey man, what's up?
Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh?
Ahhhh!
Why don 't you use ours across the hall, 'cause she has problems.
What? Wha-wha-wha-did you do ROSS!
No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.
Three people. Joshua 's not gonna be there.
God we were lame back then. Do you remember how into dinosaurs we were?
What?
I was not flirting.
How about we play for more money, say 150?
You need to learn some new slang.
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.
Are we watchin ' the tape or not?!
Ice coffee? Tell me it 's ice coffee!
Even if he were... cornered?
Big fat goalie.
Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall.
It's us.
Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot.
Hey!
What 's up?
Wait! But Ross if they don 't get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends.
Yeah. We figured when we couldn 't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
Well let 's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that's plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!
Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
Yeah.
Hi, is Molly here?
Oh my God.
But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
Oh really!?
I believe I read that somewhere!
What am I gonna do?
Y 'know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.
You are aware that she 's not a monkey, right?
Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am somewhat comfortable.
Well we 'll see!
Ugh!
Good.
Yeah?
Done!
He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
Goodnight
Mon, get out here!
Oh, that is so hot. She walks around him to the other side)
Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we 've seen each other?
Which time?
Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face -And by face I don't mean his lap. And by face, I don't mean my ass.
I told ya.
Oh, that 's sweet.
Wow, you catch on quick.
Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.
Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.
You speak Dutch?  Zeer vereerd een vriend van mijn moeder te ontmoeten.
Oh yeah. Right. So now, are -do you, do you still do music?
Interesting.
Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!
Well, that's it  You gonna crash on the couch?
I mean this poor woman.
Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here, come here...
Umm let me think...What do I want, what d-o I w-a-n-t...
Well this doesn 't even smell like opium.
But you are a real boy!
What do you like better action or comedy?
Hey!
Hey, how come, uhh, Chandler didn't come?
It is starting to get dark out there.
Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?
Just a waitress?
Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?
Hey.
Ooh, dude. That 's not gonna happen.
Hello.   It 's Gandolf!!!  So, are you in town?   Oh, well, well maybe next time then.
Oh.
No. No, you're not a loser.
Well yeah
For cam p!
Chandler!
What-what-what are you gonna do?
You wanna get out of my face?
All right I I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.
Hey!
I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.
I said it's still nap time.
You okay?!
No! You guys can 't leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!
Hey, what's up?
Ooh, Ross, look! Look!
Goodbye Geller.
I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.

All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.
Uh-huh... right... yeah...
I will flip you for it.
Fine! We 'll ask Phoebe.
So, why are you still wearing it?
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
What is that?
What?  What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert?  Why are you laughing?!
Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?
Oh sorry.  And?!
Y'know I can 't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
Never.
I don 't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.
oh umm Mike's picking me up for a date.
Hum, so, I started to say you something earlier, hum...  There was another reason I realized it was time to end it with Joey. I kind of realized I... was starting to have feelings... for someone else.
Fine.  Oh no!
Deal!
But I told you, I didn 't have the time!
My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.
Uh-oh, I feel another one coming.
Well no brush!
What?
Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you!
No.
Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..
Okay! When?!
No way!
Well, I think it 's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months.
Turned out it was a hat.
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.
Oh, tell her good luck with that.
All right. Let 's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.
Alright fine. I'll do it.
I can't believe I never realized this before, I'm in my thirty's and never been in a long-term relationship oh my god  what's wrong with me.
Oh-ow!
C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a little. . . hard to follow.
But only if it's a girl.
No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want
Yeah.
So -If you wear that you'll make mine less special.
Scotch.
Wow, that 's great Ross, I'm sorry we weren't more supportive before.
Ice chips, just ice chips. They're at the nurses' station.
I-I forgot my underwear.
Oh yea, your right. It's the second one.
Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?
Yeah!
Ah.
I can't believe you caved.
Hey.
Anything?
Chandler gets pedicures!
Oh my God, you guys have no idea.
Dude!
Yeah, it seemed pretty important.
Oh my God.
Oh, hey, don 't you have to go pick up Emily?
I 'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.
Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
What happened? What happened?
I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class.
He broke that.
Okay, just sweep it.
Well, I think I shouldn't look directly at them.
I 'm sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?
Well -Really? I thought Chandler was your best friend.
Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
That 's it.  Ow!!!
Thank you.
You guys are messin' with me, right?
Welcome home.
What 'cha readin'?
Hi!
Ooh! How was Kathy 's play?
Yuh-huh.
Oooh!
Look  it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
Just get out! Now!!
Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie 's made some new friends.
I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?
All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject.  Call Rachel.
Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
Oh Ross, thank you. Thank you.
Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?
Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
I knew.
I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs!
Hey guys!
Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... and I... want him to hook up with lots of women!  I just... All I'm saying is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.
I don 't know.
We don 't want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.
Oh yeah!
Okay come on Phoebe, it 's nothing! Monica, come on!
Can I get you another glass of wine?
Awww, just like his daddy.
Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.
So what movie do you want to see -And not another one I have to read. Okay? I get enough of that from books.
All right.
And I have costumes.
I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
Please, have some!
Ok.
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
C'mon, Ross!
She didn't hang up either!
Speech! Come on Monica!
Jen.
What is?
Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.
So you 've been sittin' around here all mornin'?
What?!
Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
You don 't pick me! You 're stuck with me!
Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me.
Hello, Mark? Hi, it 's Rachel Green.  Oh no, don't you apologize.  Yeah, I'll hold.  He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.
Hey!
Hey!
Right
Oh?
Really?! Uhh, what color is it?
WHAT! WHY?
Ross, are you okay?
He 's great! I mean we have such a good time together! He's so funny, and sooo sweet, and I'm not attracted to him at all!!
I'm not telling.
Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?
Oh-ooh-ooh! Y 'know what's a good visual aide?
Isn't that amazing?
That 's a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!
Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!
Well then I think that 's it.
No, no, no now in all seriousness, its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight, and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out!
Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!
Oh.
You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
Uh, huh.  Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.
What?! Why did you do that?
Here, pass these, will ya..
I still cannot believe you 're engaged!  Just 'cause its happening so fast; not 'cause you're such a loser.
Ross, thank God.
Hi you guys.
And um, what-what is that Ross?
I am only one man!  Okay Ross, time is up!
Hey! How was it?
I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.
He offered me one.
Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!
Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing
Oh my god. Oh my god.  Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me!
yeah thats a great idea!
Yeah.
Yes, I 've done my studying and I really know my stuff.
Look at it, isn 't it beautiful?
Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?
Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?
Will the stable boy never get the princess??
Monica and Rachel's apartment, everyone is watching the tape of the sonogram.
That 's all right. Hey you guys, you know what's going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?"
Coming.
Ross, I really don 't think
You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.
They go on one date and you 're worried about them getting married?! He's not you!
Let's never speak of this.
Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.
I guess. Why? Who's she with?
Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. you're more the fun parent.
Man, didn 't she like just get here?
Me too!
No.
Wow. I, I don 't even know what to say. Thank you.
Gimme an  'L!'
Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.
Hmm, the game's at one.
Hey!
And so engaged.
So, um, did she...
Yeah!
So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!
I know, yeah.
It 's horrible.
The Hard Rock CafÃÃ©?
Blueberry.
It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
Hi, how's it goin?
Three of your five, what?
Joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about.
May I help you?
And uh, yeah, I didn 't really, I didn't want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then  to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.
Well this is great. Y 'know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, she's really depressed.
What?
Sure I would!
Yeah, you really shouldn't.  By the way, how was that year-long dig in Cairo?
Ross, I love you!
You know what? We should call my mum's house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down.
I know.
That 's....
Excuse me?!
Good luck to ya!
And so young.
USA Today
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
No. Uch.
I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
Always.
They are awfully boxy...
Monica, I 'm your best friend.
What?!
Um-hmm.
Well then you really don 't need me to live with you.
Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
I wouldn't say never, you know there's that guy  well what about  ok well there's gotta be someone.
Yeah! I 've been working so hard this semester. I really need to go crazy y'know, blow off some steam.
You're welcome.
Si.
God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.
I don 't know.
Oh.
Hey!
Yeah, I don 't think that's what it is.
I won, hey!
Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.
Okay.
To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
I really think you need to go now.
Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.
I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course that you want it.
I 'll get her.
But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies!
This should be fun.
You must stop!
You know, our band is playing on Friday.
Really!?
Nothing!
What?
I mean I love spending time with you, y 'know I just-I hope we're moving forward. I mean, we should probably talk about that. Don't you think?
Hit me.  Hit me.  Hit me.  Hit me.  Hit me.  Hit me.  Hit me.
Really?
You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big?  This is your baby.  Hi Daddy!
Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.
Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy.
Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?
Hey! How 's Ben?
Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn't know you guys had it in ya!
Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?
She said,  "If I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."
Oh, it 's crazy about Rachel huh?
I can 't be fair. You're my boyfriend.
Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.
and that was all before 10 o'clock. The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We're not gonna be
No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.
What 's not funny?
Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.
Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
Hi!
Me too.
Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can 't! I can't! I can't! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can't. It's just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can't do it! I can't do it.
I don't know what to say.
Where are we?
No, you 're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love.
"Dear Rach, you're a great person. Sorry about your tiney-wienie."
You what?
I think it could be kind of great!
Garfunkle.
Well neither do I!
Ross, a sports car? Wouldn 't it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
Hey.  Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?
I made that joke up.
Howdy partner!
Hey there Ross!
And I still have about five seconds to spare.  Okay, that was about seven seconds.
You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
Tuna or egg salad?
Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it 's one of those 801 numbers. Right?
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.
No-no-no, don 't-don't do the accent. You've got to see her again.
You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me.
We 're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
I need to talk to you about Charlie.
It 's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean?  I mean it's like, I-I-I like that you're not involved in that part of my life.
What?
No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.
Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I don 't want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it's a terrible thing to even think this, and it's completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day! I'm very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel.
Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3
Hi!
Yeah.
Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!
I am  free!
I won the game.
Yeah, I just have to get dressed.
1250.
It 's laminated!
I don 't know.
But you 're still my friend?
Hey!
That's ridiculous!
Who jumps at loud noises!
At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps
Hungry monkey.
Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
Yeah. Uh,  a slice  six dollars?
What are you doing out there?
And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know.
Ooh! So close.
Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!
Hey.
Okay. You and me, alright? This is it.
Aww, look at the little thing.
Like what?
Okay, I'll see you after the thing.
Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.
Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about  'bah- bah-bha-bhan?'
I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas.
Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.
You have dinosaur checks?
Yes we're all in here and we would love for you to join us!
Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.
I'll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars.
Oh, making it worse!
Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?
Oh, hi.
What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?
Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.
I would love your autograph.
His legs flail about as if independent of his body!
There we go!
Yeah I 'll take that.
Three tickets to today's Rangers game!!
Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.
What happened?
I can't say, I just thought it was really good and maybe would be worth something some day.
The country?
Sorry Jill.
Hi you guys.
I would love to live with you Ross; that 's-that's great! Thank you!
Yeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name?
Do I have my own castle?
So that 's your second marriage in two years.
You don't want to work for a guy like that.
Not really. But you are much cuter then that geeky guy she used to date.
Well you, her, I mean, she's very y'know. And you're like y'know.
Really?
Wish me luck.
Hi.
Isn 't that a kind of sushi?
No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it 's time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don't' you think?
Emotional Knapsack?
It 's a bathing suit?
I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.
I 'm sorry
Whoa! This looks like an all day job, I 'll have to cancel my yoga class.  Hey Ross!
Okay. Wow.
That's great!
It 's frightening.
Ross, when 's this comet thing start?
What was the other one Ross?
That's what you just said!
Allright. Well thank you so much for coming...
Am not!
Obviously! So, how do we decide?
Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
Yeah-yeah, we never had that,
Well, she has issues.
Yes, but in Ross 's case, they both know in two weeks that 's it.
That 's right! I'm not!
Bye!
Oh! How's it going?
Oh, God! Please, somebody say something.
Calm ourselves?
What-what about Monica?
Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
Really?
Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I 've decided to accept the fact that you're going out with her.
What?!
Yeah honey, I 'm standing right there! Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet.
Seriously? You divorce-o?
Why don 't you look in the mirror, scrud.
Okay!
Okay, Dave in the membership office, handles quitters.  Uh, excuse me,  are you a member?
Wanna peek?
Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.
Oh.
I kissed Kathy.
Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.
Why don 't you open with a joke?
Okay. So, which boxes are mine?
But you did! I mean, let 's be honest.
G'bye, Nana.
Really? You think so?
So?
Oh yeah!
And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and  whoa-whoa- whoa, sh-she's naked!
Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.
I 'm gonna get back to retraining.
Hey, what do you want to drink?
Shut the door! Shut the door!!
This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.
Well Monica just told me that they don 't.
Ow! Ow!
Excuse me.  You should check this out, tell the other tenants. Apparently he's running around looking for some kind of a hot girl.
It 's Joshua.
Whoa!
Ohh, it 's a bit small.
Don't you want to know about the sex?
That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
How is it going with Charlie?
Hi.
Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. I'll get the information.
Oh.
What's the matter Ross?
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
Hello, people who do not live here.
Oh my God! Ross!!!
Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.
Oh, What's the matter?
Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so
Hey. They're just trying to decide somehting.
Let's do this alright.
Oh well, we don 't because we got the other pl-place.
Humiliating and noble!
You cuddled.
What?
Ross.
...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there.
Ugh.
I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
Shh! It is a family name!
Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
Well let 's just say its she's lucky she has a sweet ass, 'cause she's not so good at the writing.
What?
I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so...
Well, it's a little low... pick up a little...  a little bit more...  a little bit more...  There you go!  Now throw it away!
Well don't just say.
Just get out of here, okay?
Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
All right, I 'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you but you were so mad already!
Oh.  Thank you.
Well, I was thinking that it 'd probably be okay because Ross hasn't gone out with Rachel in five years!
What 's up, Ross?
Here you go.
I 'm sorry, who are you?
PHOE-BE.
What have you got there?
What?!
Joshua.
Hey! I 'm an  actor too! I'm not sure. I think they're taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island.
The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it!  You always have to think about the trail!
What?
You know what 's really good here, the lobster. What do you say shall I just order three.
Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! It was really wonderful! Did you just make that up?
I could 've been killed I hope you know!
No, but ah, there 's coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.
Mint!
Just okay -Did you do it right?!
Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?
I appreciate this soo much, I've been trying to go out with this guy for like a month.
Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other.
Really?
I miss you to. Well, at least I think I do.
So are we friends again?
Okay, I need a, I need a drink!
Oh my God!
What's the matter?
Okay.
Oh my God!
That was such a fun night!
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, till death parts us.
Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
Tho?
No, hey, it's been great.
What are you doing here!
Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth!
Hit me, hit me.
My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.
Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.
Where have you been?
Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I 'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...
So you're gonna move?
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
Uh... What can I do for you?
Mary-Angela.
Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
Well what if somebody steals something? How are you gonna run after him with one leg shorter than the other?!
that she was the huge guy that mugged you? Yah.
Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her.
Well, why do you call him Gandolf?
I respectfully disagree.
I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so I hope you're hungry.
Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.
What, he 's 18.
Plus hotels are fun! My room has this little fridge full of free snacks!
Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
You know you kissed me first.
Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?
Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS.
Hey, are you okay?
Ohhh!!
Sure.
On the touchy.
Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!
Ohh, you 're a freak!!
Oh my God.
Oh, yeah go ahead.
So don 't think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as a a two month anniversary present.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!
Oh.
Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.
I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?
Oh no-no-no-no, no!
I hate you!!
Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!
Oh, so did I.
Yeah.
Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.
Melinda!
Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing.
Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.
Come here  Oh! There she is! Hi!
Well, that ' me.  Here, have this.  I'm only allowed one piece of carryon anyway.
I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!
Oh, was I doing it again?
Were you this cute in high school?
Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.
You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
Wait. Really?!  'Cause mine get me out of tickets.
Maybe this wasn't your shot.
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud?
OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.
Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?
My husband.
I 'm thinking, I'm gonna order a pizza.
Oh yeah! Actually, that 's one of the reasons why we're not a couple.
I can't believe you did this.
Yes?
Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so...
Listen also we 're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.
Sure, nice.
No Santa? Was I bad?
What kind of an emergency?
Look at that!
I don 't know. I guess the other people just don't care enough.
I-I am Kristen.
Fine, it's fine...  I'll just shower by myself...
But we're fine.
We came over as soon as we saw.
Don 't be too long.
Hey.
I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!!  You are surprisingly strong!
Ooor...
Dancing on your feet! Like the other girls did it.
Phonetically?
No-no-no-no, no, it 's a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can't we savor the precious moments?  Those are some huge breasts you have.
Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo.
No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.
What?
Good luck to you.
Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!
Okay, we 're not.
But my apartment is so...
Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.
Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn 't even be an actor!
What?!
Well, I've never gone this fast before.
Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows?
Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and Rachel?
Is it an engagement ring?
Oh that.
Can I see that for second.
You know, you're a really great listener. Most guys I go out with, they just talk and talk.
She 's moving on! Okay, if it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else! And unless you're thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It 's over.
No, no, no!
Yeah.
So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable?  Yeah, sounds about right.
So Ross, what your problem?
Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we're really good friends.
Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?
I got it! Scotch tape.
All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!
You know what? There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win.
I knew it! Because you love Rachel.
Ross, that is gorgeous!
Hi!
Uh, Rach?
Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I 'll go under, you go over!
Nothing.
Oh God, I am so sorry honey...
Do you have any respect for your body?
How's it going?
Hey!
Huh? So whaddya think? Casa de Joey. Huh? I decorated it myself.
It is going to be okay!  It was worth a shot.
Santa's mad at me.
All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.
Hot?
Fine.
Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!
Course there, they just call it food.
Still on Amelia Earhart?
Ohhh
Let's show 'em.
I can 't figure out what to make Monica.
Phoebe's Mike?
Ross, what are you doing?!
What 's your problem?
What happened to the library?
How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?
Okay, I 'll see you in a bit.
Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?
Okay fine, I did. But I didn't see anything, I swear.
Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.
Hi!
Losers walk!
Yeah, someplace nice.  How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
Hello.
Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second.  Whup, okay.  Hello! Vegas? Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? We would like some more beers. Hello? Ohh, I forgot to dial!
Hey. Ooh Ross! How 'd the conversation go?

Come on look guys, don't fight.
All right! Bring it on, you
Take it like a man, Ross!
What?! What? What happened?!
I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah, we 're gonna go.
Why not?
After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.
Monica! Come on!
To Ross!
Nice hair. What 'd ya do? Swim here?
Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
Umm, I 'm talking about that which you already know but won't admit. You love her again; you re-love her!
Yeah. I 'm sorry.
Check this out. Can I have this?
You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
Oh... Bye guys.
Mm-hmmm
I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just...
Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us.
Ah.  Oh.
Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one.
Shh!  Of course, why don 't we go inside?
I'm just not going.
Come on!
Yeah.
I realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people, but I really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is take care of a child.
Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously.
Really...? Guys do that...? That's... weird...
There you go! Someone came!
Huh.
Uh, well... Joey and I broke up.
Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he 's gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can't.  But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.
Hello?
Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech?
Well That 's y'know-That's-We've been alone for the last twenty minutes we're doing okay. Besides y'know what? I-I-Maybe we won't be alone, 'cause lately I-I-things have been happening between me and Ross, y'know? Right before I went into labor, we-we had this kiss. Y'know? So it might be the the beginning of something.
Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?
They're waiting for me, Ross. I can't do this right now, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Because we hate them.
No, it starts with a silent  "M".
Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don 't know what the big deal is!
No, no, it's not, don't listen to him!  I'm gonna thump you!
" Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease  " Darn it! Now, I don't know who to get to the next verse.
Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.
No. No, I haven 't seen him.
Yeah.
Good!  'Cause I've got a product report to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I don't fall asleep.
What do you mean, comforted her?
How exciting!
Ross thanks.
Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I 'm always the hostess.
Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?
Was it really that good?
Ross umm, there 's something that I've got to tell you, there's-there's someone else.
That 's less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was.
I don 't know. They-they must be your mother's, but please, please don't ask her. I'll throw these away.
I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's first words .
Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?
I came to talk to you about Howard.
Well, I 've tried everything. I give up. I guess I'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe.  Kids love that right.
Hey!
Oh yeah.
Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I 'm not drinking on this date tonight. "Umm, I'm a recovering alcoholic. I'm a Mormon," or "I got so hammered last night I'm still a little drunk?"
Hey! That 's just poking me in the eye!
I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!
You could drink the fat.
Come on, you made coffee!
Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.
Ooy.
Pick me!!
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.
Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?
You guys wanna get some coffee?
Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.
My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake.
It-it's really heavy.
Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
Ooh, very official.
Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say.
Now, don 't argue with me
Hi guys!
Congratulations!
Geez Ross, you could have showered.
All right, sorry.
Couldn 't I just say, "This is Ross?"
Morning, Ross.
Wonderwoman!
Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This is why Adam Carter wouldn 't go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region!
I'll get it.  Hello.  Hi Emily!  Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second.
Oh. What's a lurker?
Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.
All right girls, and man. Let 's see your final tallies.  Ohhhh, Debbie,  321 boxes of cookies,  Very nice.
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?
Um, hum.
No.
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that "Woo-hoo" thing.
Oh, uh, again. Can I make a special request
You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?
Why should we?
Hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment?
14?
That's what I hear, yeah.
Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is not the number for  this store, 038 is Atlanta. And I...
Ross, you don 't have to yell.
It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today.
You want to see her again, right?
You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!
You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on you!
It 's my joke.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.
Really?
Why? Is he? He is! Isn 't he? He's dating that slut in marketing!
Which... which... which... Which one is it?
Doorknob?
You just give him a spoon baby!
No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!
Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?
Wow! Thanks!
Oh. Thanks.
You picked a great couch.
Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!
You. Like you haven 't done enough.
Oh thank you. Hey y 'know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
Fauna.
I'm sorry, it's not here.
You stink!
Not so much.
Hi honey!
Yeah!
Okay! You take care!
All right! Ross, do you think it 's easy for me to see you with somebody else?
Honey, it 's not pushy, he gave her his home number.
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn 't that sad?  God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?
Thanks man.
All right, well I guess I 'll just have to do what I do on dates.
Thank you.
No, ten o'clock.
I did the first time! Oh. Oh..  <gets up and walks into the kitchen> And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving Emily to you.
No! That would be so awkward! Look -Besides, we work in different departments. He's on the sixth floor y'know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. What's the big deal? It could be worse, it's not like he's calling me Muriel.
Yeah.
Let it go, Ross.
Wait, you 're giving me your Porsche , you're kidding me right?!
It's nothing.
What?!
What did you do on yours?
Ross!
Look, if you did...
I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.
Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
How do you know about this?
Of course I do.
Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.
You got two more twos?
Ow!
Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don 't take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
You broke a little girl 's leg?!!
That hot girl from their wedding?
What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.
When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
Me too!
Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?
Yeah!
What is in the cup?!
At least I care about his feelings!
So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that 's nice!
Hey!

Well, somebody got some last night.
Ross, ten o'clock.
What?
Oh, because I was thinking, the semester's over; you're not my teacher anymore.
Oh yeah.
Hello?! I still don 't know what the hell I'm doing!
So, rocks.
Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!
So what are you saying? It 's now or never?
Weee!!!
Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That just means it's working.
Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before?
Animals dressed as humans.
Are those your teeth??
Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?
Why don 't you fill out this address card.
Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.
No-no-no! No, no, no, we 're not married.
Yeah you are!!
No!
It 's pretty, Okay date of birth?
Uh, put your elbow in it.
What 's in the cup, Ross?
The burping clogs?
Don 't say that I have no sentiment!  This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed!  This is from the museum from the first time we were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!
Man, I gotta get a kid.
Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so
Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he 's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry.
Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.
Ok!

That is a slap in the face.
Gimme a  'Y!'
Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.
Are you trying to get everybody divorced?
Hey!
But Ross, you want the name Ruth!
And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?
And now for the great news.
I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
Oh, well, actually.
I want to take my tongue... and...
Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!
What?
Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.
Oh hi!
Mine was a humdinger
Really? You two?
Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.
But, we 'll stay here with you.
Ross! Wait!
And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
Uhh, the ball thing.
Hey!
No-no, that 's not, that's not me Phoebe, that 's her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F.  Best Friends Forever.
Make love? What are you a girl?
THE HELL I DO!
Well that -y'know it's just uh, I've never done that before. Me and him alone.
She is?
Y 'know, there's two women dude.
Hi Ross!
Okay, well g 'night.
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You 're my hero!
Oh I don 't-I don't know.
Okay, but I get to hop on after her.
Oh.
I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.
Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat.
Hi!
Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
I think we 're here.
This game is kinda fun.
Yeah.
Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming.  What?
Christmas eve.
What?
Nooo!   Hello?  Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much.  Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.
Baby. Ross.
Yeah, we are.
I can do it, okay? Come on, let 's go.
It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
See, there's always one guy.   "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."
Oh I don 't know honey. It's gonna be really late.
Your license please.
Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin ' it by the park.
Thanks.
You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now!
Noooo!!!!
Talk to me.
Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did!  See what happens when you break the code?
Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while.
I heard that!
They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.
Of course we 'll help! Yeah! We'll be here!
Ross.
What?
No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think?
Yeah, they 're fine.
And the antennae Oh my God you're Spudnik!
And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.
Hey, it's me. Here's Ross.
I think face to face.
Does so count!
Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game.
What?!
You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste.
Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?
What is wrong now?!
Okidoki!  Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.
Hi, sure!
Frankie? What're you talking about?
Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
Alright, just put your hands out and I'll back up into them.
Why?
Okay! Okay wait! You listen to me! You listen to me! Since I have been waiting four women, that 's four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies! I'm next! It's my turn! It's only fair! And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I'm going to sue you! Not this hospital, I'm going to sue you! And my husband  he's a lawyer!
Hey.
The doctor.
Wait. Are you talking about the Dewar grant?
Umm Wow, all right.  Wow! Yay! Ooh, I 'm gonna meet a guy! And really soon! And he's gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night.
They 're not!! Ross, they're just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!
I know.
That's right. But if you don't want to know
I am shocked! Shocked!!
Just aim for the bump.
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I 'm not even sure I got it.
Big bullies!!
Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.
Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
Here, I got five, I got five.
So you eh, you talked to Joey?
Can I get you some water?
Oh okay, I 'll fix that to. What's her e-mail address?
What... What...
Nothing -Why?!
Hi!
Hi everyone.
Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?
Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?
Oh, hey...
Get your hands out of there! No!
No, no, ACC-cept that.
Yeah.
What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
Y 'know that's really fair. Y'know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I'll show you! Come here.
Hey, have you guys seen Monica?
Really?
Hey man, what's up?
Yeah, okay, bye.
Hey look-look, Phoebe 's talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
Mark's a genius!
That she 's gonna move in with you and maybe then she'll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you're already married, she'll just be happy. Y'know? You're just, you're very sad.
I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing  "Happy Birthday". Then we would all go into... HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!!  They have to learn!
Yes!
Give her a key to your apartment.
Great.
Hi!
I 'm gonna need a copy of those.
What?
Hi!
What are you guys talking about?
Uh.  Did you call your parents?
Or?
Ohh! Me too!
You can 't wear that! I'm wearing the famous tux! James Bond's tux!
Just some stuff for the party.
Oh, Ross
Hey.
No. I don't think so.
What? What 's going on?
That was a great lecture today. Did you get a little hair cut?
Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh,  I'm still in love with you Ross.
Wait a minute. What about that summer during college that you lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer?
Holy mother of God!!!
I don 't know, Monica picked out the flowers.
Oh Daddy, no he didn 't mean anything by that, he really didn't.
Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.
Why don't you just get a roommate?
Hi, Ross.
What's goin' on?
What line?
That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing.
I just don't want to be alone tonight.
Oh, hey!
I think it would make me wanna marry you even more.
Co-founded!
Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might  end up hurting.
Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!
The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!
I 'll just run to the store and get some.
What? What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? Have you never chased anyone through the airport before?
Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.
See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!
Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it?  Oh forget it!  Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village.
Ben just said hi.
Don 't worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent's strength and weight against him.
And was the curse lifted?
Well, whaddya think?
Woo-hoo, stuud!
Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.
Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this...
Tell it to the Time Turtle!
Oh, you know what? I'll come with you!
All right, well I just wanted to say thank you though for diverting Kyle 's ex.
I think it's winning.
Oh, it 's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
I cannot believe you didn 't pick me.
No. She 's going to live with us for eight weeks.
Sorry.
Let's see, today's Monday... Never.
Yeah?
So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?
Come on, touch it!
The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
All right, but in the future...
You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?
You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?!
Ross, hey, the band 's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so
All right, it won't come off!
Yeah.
Do it!
He 's getting married tomorrow right?
Hey you guys... You're never gonna believe it. This headhunter called me. I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci. Gucci wants me.
No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe 's our friend! Well, I'm not gonna watch it!
I .can 't .believe this!
Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!!  That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.
Uch.
I was not flirting.
Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty.
Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
Let me see what you wrote about yourself
Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
Nah, I don't really want her to see.
Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!
Okay, I guess it doesn 't seem that weird.
Yeah, we haven't dropped it in
Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.
Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?
You're on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay?
Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?
I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.
No awareness.
He 's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago.
She 's in the bathroom.
If you hold a spider.
Okay.
Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is.
Ohh... Oh! You were not meant to see me before the wedding. It's bad luck.
Wow!
Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
So what are you gonna do?
How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
Dude!
That's what I'm saying.
Hold on! There is something different.
OK.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?
Alright, who do you want as your emergency contact?
Uhh, hang in there?
Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o 'clock position.
Wow, it was so -wow!
Ohh!  Hi!
I said art lover.
Sure!
Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
Like she 's really mean, and she's over critical, and-and-No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!
Hey! He beat ya.
Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
So, what is this information worth to you, my friend?
The Hospital, Mr. and Mrs. Geller are there, along with Aunt Lillian. Ross and Monica enter and everyone says hi and kisses.)
Hey.
Hi.
You don 't know?
She went on one of those spray-on tan places.
What is he doing here?!
Where ya going?
Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
Yeah, Ross is here so...
Yes. They're insanely white.
Why not?
Well, didn 't you just hear what I said?!
Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!
There 's just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don't know if you'd understand.
Break up with Charlie!
I can 't believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York.
Hi!
That was good beer.
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
Oh, let me see!
Yeah!  Excuse me...
Well what did you send?
Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face...  ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks.
Yep, pretty much.
Maybe you need to spice things up a little.
What is that?
Bodington's!
All right.
You missed a belt loop.
Ross, the heat!
Yeah, I can't wait to go back to work.
STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
I'm not a dropper!
Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story.
Hey, I tell you what. Let 's you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on!
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
Sure, is she married?
What?!
Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.
It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.
Who wants French toast?
Who's Paul?
Ohhhh.
This is the last call for Flight 1066 to Athens. The last call.
I'm not blowing her off, I actually just got off the phone with her, were going out tomorrow night, I mean I hope that's ok with you stranger from the coffee house.
Oh, thank you!
Right.
Well, isn't, isn't that gonna be weird?
Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.
Yaaaay!
Okay! So, we 'll just stay married.
The sexy blonde behind the counter.
He hates me. My nephew hates me.
Shhhh!!!
Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.
Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you?
Until then, General Grant, why don 't you set up camp  right there.
I think I'm gonna take off.
Wow! So, how are you?
A little bit more.
That's what I was doing too.
Not the other one?
Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers! It must be a good review! Is it great?!
Thank you so much!
So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. . .
You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?!
Got a job on a river boat?
So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?
He is! But he 's getting divorced-Ross! Maybe you know him.
No, come on Ross!  Look, Ross, we have to get past this.
Emma's awake.
Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.
Oh dear God!
Ugh, okay Sherlock!
The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.
Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic.
I can't believe this is happening.
I'm sorry guys, closed set.
Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?
Yeah Ross it 's okay, it's me, Mr. Stevens.
Yeah.
You don 't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
Oh wow, I don 't feel well.
Naked?
Stop it!
This is like figure skating team all over again.  I mean synchronized swimming.  I mean- I mean the balance beam.  Help me!
I really can't say.
Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.
Ooh! I know what you could make!  I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff?  You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.
Oh! Sorry! Umm, I actually do need to talk to you.
I do Raquel.
Yes!
Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later?
This totally makes sense!
I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.
Oh-oh, absolutely!
That makes more sense.
What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
Okay, you guys free tonight?
I 'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
What is it?
You feel that too? Oh, I thought that was just me!
No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It 's a very big deal, there's a lot of people there I have to meet.
If it helps, I could slide over.
I do, I believe you.
All right, I 'll see you guys.
Okay fine! Fine! We 'll just have to think of some other way to put the whole 'Who came onto who,' thing to rest! Come on now, think!!
Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.
Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
Can I go next?
Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny 's funeral in here.
Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!
Oh honey, but it is just about
There are a couple of forms to fill out.
Hey, what do you want to drink?
Did you do it on our invitations?!
Three.
I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go.  Mark, I need you!
Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.
Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
Oh my God!
Does anybody need more coffee?
Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?
You got married again.
Yeah, I guess. I-I I mean, do-do you think we 're ever gonna have that?
No-no, it 's really not huge.
Oh!
Let's ditch him!
I don 't care! You just get him!
Nice save.
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it 's like enough!
Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
This is your place?
That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.
I did. Now I'm the idiot.
Yeah? Well, you should know. You 've bought like a billion of 'em.
What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of person that works at a library.
Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die!
Ross has a boyfriend.
Oh my God!!
No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it.
All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos!
Julie.
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
Hi Monica!
Ross?
Okay but if you don 't find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
Oh, come on squeeze it.
Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!
So. Ross, I 've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change.
Oh, I don't mean to be a square, but I'd really appreciate it if you wait and drink your wine after the kids are asleep? Oh uh, thanks for this, I hope I can do the same for you sometime.
What did they do?
Yeah, but uh, I don 't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf.
Really?
Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?
Never mind. But it was going to be really good.
Hi!
Yeah, but you didn 't.
Ben, dinner!
Okay, bye!
And you know Monica and Ross!
Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to decide what messages I should or should not get?
And y'know what, I 'm gonna, I'm gonna go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, I'm gonna stop by around 8
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.
All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.
Well, you tell a lot of jokes!
Sure.
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear.  What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it 's just Jason's so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it's just better than having just like a really, really, really nice  butt.   Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!
Of course not, because you 're in love with her.
I 'll call you later. Bye Ross.
Wow, that's great! So, tell me about the grant!
No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
No. No.
Okay.  Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe
Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?
Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just..  Here we go.  Looking good Gellers!
No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.
So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out.
Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?
Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We 're the same, you and me.
I 'm serious.
Yeah, well, I gotta work, I 'm sorry.
Pheebs come on! Bunny vs. Doody! We 're waiting!   Okay. Okay guys, one match, winner take all.  Oh wait-wait! What does the winner get?
Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?
Yes.
The guys across the hall are throwing water balloons at us.
Oh my God, this is so cool!
Yeah, she 's been out there for twenty minutes, I'm surprised you didn't hear her on the way over.
Okay, but it's Valentine's Day!
What?
Oh-ho!
Ross, how many parents have you lost?
Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?
Sure  who are you?
What?!
I know.
Hey.
Well, I would love to but the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.
It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon!  She's-she's gonna kill me.
Ross, Joey is not here.
You had to do it, didn 't you? You couldn't just leave it alone.
Is your tongue swelling up?
Well let 's just hope it works. Y'know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?
Thanks!
EH, what do you know!
Already?!
Yeah?
You 're Spudnik.
I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.
Doesn 't he?
That's nice.
You go get that animal outta here.
Listen, Robert 's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?
You kids ready?
Oh my God!
Of course there 's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
May I have the rings?  Emily, place this ring on Ross 's finger as a symbol of your bond everlasting.  Ross, place this ring in Emily's hand as a symbol of the love that encircles you forever.
Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
At a fake game!!
Hi.
Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
She said that?!
No, I don 't think we'll be doing that.
Oh, don 't worry I have plenty of sun block, it's SPF-30.
Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how 's it, how's it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together?
Okay.
Ooh, I like those sunglasses.
Congratulations! I didn 't want to say anything in front of Joey 'cause I didn't know if he knew yet.
I don 't need a tissue! I'm fine-d!
You are so just doing this out of spite.
I 'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.
Ross, why do you hate our child?
Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.
My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey.
No,  'cause she didn't tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I've only got a week left, y'know? I've really gotta start living now! , leans back, and starts reading.)
You 're a genius, Ross.
Oh, she 's so tiny.  Where'd she go?
Why didn't I get that message?
You have chalk on your face.
Taffy, really? I've never had any.
Diet soda.
Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they 're probably not even listening!
All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.
He 's got a girlfriend!
Well, we've gotta go.
Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison.
You blew them away!
Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!
What?! You can't -what did you tell her?
Honey, cover it up with the boat!
Roll playing You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!
Ross, I know what you 're thinking.
You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it.
Are you going to eat that bread?
Well-well, I don 't know Ross-really?
Well, that 's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba.
I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like,  "Ooh, where'd Ross go?"
He's open!
Ross?
Storming out!
You were really gonna do that, weren't you?
We should start with the big stuff. Y 'know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch.  I got it.
Oh, Ross, I 'm sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You 're probably just gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate. You're gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And she's gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
Hmm mmmhm..
Yeah, right.
Well, I really wanted to meet you guys, but I have to run. I 'll see you later?
Hey.
Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best.
O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...
Well, it is overdue.
Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
No-no, I don 't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
I'll see you later.
What?
Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!
Who is it?
Wh -You dated my sister!
What?! Why?!
I love both of you!
Yeah! Yeah. I 'll be all right.
Ooh, I've been better...
I 'm fine, but that's not important. What's important is how was she?
Oh come on Ross!!
Ohh! That 's so sweet of you! Oh yum!  Did you put pickles on this?
Oh so-so not really never.
What party?
Wait, this is important! Can Ella wait?
Not fun anymore?
So, should we tell her?
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up.
Boys? We're going in.
Sorry, prom queen.
Well, can 't you tell her that you are not in the mood?
Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-
There's a forest right outside.
Why can 't I find that?
Well, I 'm sure you get another one at Ann Taylor 's.
Here 's what's gonna happen. The music's gonna start, you're gonna dance, we're gonna tape, you don't look at the camera. Any questions?
Let 's do it! Ross?
Hey -ooh so, how was Vermont?
Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?
Ok, unless you're not gonna try to get me to join a cult are you?
Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks
Cool!
What the hell are you doing?!
Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's   "Audition didn't go so well.  Yeah it did?"
Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
But do you wanna get back together?
Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.
I was shrieking... like a Marine.
You could kick anyone 's ass you want too.
You obviously haven 't screwed over a lot of your friends.  Which we all appreciate.
They do!
Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her.
Come on!
Duh!! Christmas!
Hey Ross. What's up bro?
Oh.
Eww!
Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!
For what it 's worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
Ross, it's too hard.
Here's your warm milk.
A card! A card! I pick a card!
I'll pull you through.
Very cool.
I 'm right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there's no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!
Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?
Ross I -We tried all the spicy food. It's not working.
And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
Remember when we were in high school together?
Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God!
Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way. All right, I'll see you guys later.
Ohh, uh-huh so much!
That's a great story-can I eat it?
What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?
It wasn 't my ring! It's Ross's ring! That's why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose.
I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now!
But like how?
Night.
Hey.
It 's the baby's buttock, she's breech.
Why?!
What does that mean?
Okay, then you don 't know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I'm wrong, who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive.
Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name.
So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.
That 's all right.
What?!
Ross, you can 't tell her not to go. You just started dating.
What are you doing?! Get in the front!
Hey! We 're here!
Yeah!
Hi. Sorry, things aren 't working out so well.
Yeah, I definitely. I don 't like the name Ross.
Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good -bye cheer. So okay!  Ready! Okay! Gimme an 'E!'
Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how 's he doing?
I know the code to his answering machine.
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
Why?
Oh you 're serious. Sure!
And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her.
What is going on?!
I saw it.
Oh, it 's a poster for that World War I movie that I'm in, check it out.
All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.
No, it 's New York magazine. It 's an article about the best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting?
Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat -or a beanbag chair!
Barbados!
Okay.  Are you sure you wanna hear this?
When do you think we lost her?
Not right now.
Good. Bye!
All right, so we weren 't pre pared!
Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
Umh... Kurts Baley?
But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready.
Hit me!
Well, if you stay till 9
No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.
Hi you guys.
Ooh, I have a little heart attack.
All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
I can't believe the guys missed this.
Then what?
Jij spreekt Nederlands? Dat is te gek. Heb je familie daar? (Translation
We really are.
Hm-mmm!
Hi.
It 's not a real game! I made it up!
Say we are unagi!
Isn 't that great?
Oh, I 'm sorry I spoiled you're evening.
Uh-huh! I know. I 'm coming soon to a theater near you! I'm in THX! I'm unsuitable for children!
I 'm going to let him.
Ubb.
Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?
Okay.
You think so? I 've always kinda hated it.
Yeah, I can 't live with Joey once the baby comes. I don't want my child's first words to be,  "How you doin'?"
We 've come for her things.
Yeah.
Oh God.
Phoebe, hang on a second.  Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.
I could not have done this without you.
When, when did -how, how did you
Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
What?!
Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross.   Hold on!  Hey Ross. What's up bro?
Yes, Ross.
All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
I would-Sequoia?
But I think we should tell her.
Hey, everybody!
Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.
Yeah, take your time.
This is gonna make me very popular.
Okay.  What?! What are you doing here?!
Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets
Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?
Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.
Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.
I knew.
I guess.
Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show.
What?!
I 'm not laughing.
My scones.
Not good, Ron.
I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
Hi!  Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it tonight?
Oh.
You just finished?
Hey-hey-hey you made it!
Okay, well, stop staring at them.
Why do they put so much steam in there?!
Charity?
Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross...
Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?
Huh. But still Ross, you 're worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y'know what I mean?
Have fun!
If the school finds out you 're fired.
A little bit.
You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.
Here comes another contraction.
Excuse me, I 'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back, I've got a Schemp in my office.   What are you doing?
See? See? It was because you were looking fat pervert!
What?! Why?
Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.
A what?!
Sure!
All right.
Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but...  you know, you and Monica have the same  "I'm gonna kill you" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her...
This is great, this is great, what else, what else?
So?
Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.
And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you 're gay and addicted to heroin.
I think I might need one more cup of coffee.
No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.
What?!
Y'know what, it doesn 't matter, 'cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!
OK, what're we gonna do about this?
So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. How 's it going?
Thanks for going along with this.
How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea.
Wow, this place looks great.
No way! If anything you 've gotta let me win! My wife thinks I'm a wimp!
Monica and I are engaged.
Ross!
Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
Okay, I 'll pay you tomorrow.
She 's in labor! You like that you sick son of a bitch!
I don't know!
Uh-oh.
Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
Yeah, baby!
So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe...  huh-huh?
Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?
I can 't tell you that, no.
Ah, you mean lager.
What, because that 's your answer to everything?
All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?
Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
You bitch.
Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert!
I swear I didn 't.  Hey! Is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?
Hi.
Um, hum.
Hey!
Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?
Yeah!
I didn't do that.
Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride?
Oooh that may be a New World's record
Yeah?
Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny
You love her!
Like lovers.
Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!
Y 'know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!
Say hello to Aaron, your future son-in-law.
Okay, it 's an audio question, name this television theme song.
Yeah!
I was.
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours.
What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
Seriously?
Ohh, give him a kiss for me!
Why are you going? He said, she wanted the shrew!
Yeah, his name is Ross.  What?
Great!
Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?
Really? Wow, this is so much better than I
Yeah well, you know what, so is uh, Sorentino's.
Hey guys, what are you doing?
Am I interrupting?
Oh my God.
I know.
Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?
Hold on! You got her pregnant?
Umm, no thank you.
Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Alright, 5 more minutes.
There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won 't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver. There! That wasn't about the wedding.
Okay.
Ohh great.
Umm that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some- something huh?
Y 'know, I can't believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I'm never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!
I'm talking about me having a baby.
And you Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel 's bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra ...
Hellooo!
You're not Rachel.
Morning. Here you go.
Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!
Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.
Oh, I don't know.
Ah, who is Emma?
I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum.
I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time.
You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?
Yeah!
Yes!
We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.
And?
Hi!
No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don 't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.
Oh, really?
Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be...
Hey!
Maybe...
I 'm sorry, so umm, so where are we?
You know he's gay?
Mmh-mmh.
I know! Hey, you haven 't been practising the routine, have you?
Yeah, leave!
Hey.
Howdy doody.
We won't?
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
What?!
Hey, you know what might help?
Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
Oh, ah, isn't there another professor that is supposed to come with us?
Oh, no problem. I 'm so glad I could help. Happy for you.
Cool... "Urkel" in Spanish is "Urkel."
Ugh!
Swear?!
Okay.
I didn't know you guys hung out.
Yeah, me too.
All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve.
Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?
What are you talking about?!
Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off one item of clothing. It hasn 't happened yet, but we're all very excited.
I licked my arm, what?
Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
Really?
Yeah!
Really.
You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you 've got a girlfriend?
Ooh... Is it because of what might be on the bedspread, because I saw that news report too, with the infra red and the ... I could just...
Ok, I'll walk you out.
Oh, yay!
Hey, do you want to go away this weekend?
Hi
Well look, you don 't really like the one from uptown and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done!
Hey! Hi!
Good luck, with your girlfriend.
We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
We're gonna have sex.
Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!
Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke.
No, of course, of course I 've heard of them! Ross, what did you get?
Why can 't you get a girlfriend your own age?
I 've never been more convinced of your love for her.
No.
Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole  "seizing" thing but um, Emily called you today.
And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.
Two it is. Ross, how about you?
Ross, look, I know I 've been giving you a lot of jabs and it's partly because I'm very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told me and the many, many,  many stories that Rachel has told me that, well  you're not  all bad.
Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me.  What?
Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.
We took a cab. Did you guys walk?
Hey, you got me, put it in.
Huh.
Well then,  what about you?! Huh?!
What's that?
Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?
Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!
I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that.
Okay dude!  Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.
You know what honey, you go ahead, we 'll call her an alternate.
Happy birthday!!!
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation , and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad .
FYI..
Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?
God, I 'm exhausted.
I can come back.
Your mother just added him to her list.
She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.
Yeah. You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.
Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!
This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.
Hey.
Uh, actually I find Marion 's views far to progressionist.
I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us.
Can't wait.
Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!
Dude, you're shaking!
Oh God!
Eh, y'know what, she 's to political, she probably wouldn't let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
14?
Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.
Y 'know, I'm still 29 in Guam.
Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!
Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants.
See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven 't even thought about what I will say. What should I say?
You can open your eyes now.
Well
I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.
Space cowboy!
Ooh! That's so nice...
Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental.
No. No-no-no-no.
Wow.
Come on.  Oh! And, uh, by the way....
Eleven minutes.  And now twelve. So, do you like the beer?
No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
Ross, how could you let this happen?
That 's so sweet.
What was that?
Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?
Mother-Kisser...  I'll shut up.
I wasn 't escaping.
Y 'know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she's l-l-lookin' up at us and smiling right now.
Ow! Ross!!
You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.
Hey!
What about all that  "friends forever" stuff?
Bye.
Hey you.
Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
We already knew that!
This is it. Unless we're on a break.
All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
All right, big brother.  Which of these do you think would make your little sister look hotter, so your best friend would want to do her?
She took all my stuff.
Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
What are you doing?
Nothing. Just something I want to get Phoebe's opinion on for Valentine's Day.
Don't play with his things.
Fine!  We went out.
Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you
Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48....
Ok.
I just really wanted to apologize again and and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting.
So what are you going to do?
No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.
Okay.
We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.
Vulva?
That's okay. If - if we hit anything, the engine will explode, so you know, it's better if you're thrown from the car.
What married?
Okay, then.
Hey buddy.
I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say
Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!
If you want it to be.
Hit me!
Would you like to move over to the couch?
Well, that 's great.
The sex of the baby, Ross.
Oh, yes! We'll have ourselves a little baby Ruth
No! It 's just that, Kate bothered me.
I want to. I love her so much, but I 'm afr It's too huge.
Great!
All right! So, was it amazing?
Um, would you like to come in?
Oh my god.
No!! You can 't!!
With ah, extra anchovies.
Do you wanna play football?
Hey! Don 't do the crime if you can't do the time.
Okay, now would you say that that 's more than 50 yards away from Sting, his wife, or a member of his family?
Hi! I 'm gal pal Rachel Green, and if you want the dirt, I'm the one you come too. This might be Joey's baby , who knows? I'm just kidding-Seriously,  gal pal Rachel Green.
But, I put some honey in it.
Hey.
All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?
Yes! She 's gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo.
Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift.
I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.
Me! On my computer.
I've had a really good time tonight.
Is he alright?
Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.
Come on you guys, we want you to know we're  very very sorry.   Right guys?
Okay.
No?
Like your sweater.
We'll watch him.
Well, why don 't you tell her to stop being silly!
Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica 's place was nice, but her fiancee sure stares a lot.
Noo.
Making her a mixed tape?
I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo.
Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!
Okay. Let 's use this brush.
I like it!
Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!
To be nice.
So it was really cool seeing you lecture today.
Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!
Name?  I know Ross but what 's it short for? You know like, like Rossel or Rosstepher.
You are so adorable.
Chandler! What are you doing here?
Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.
Congratulations!
Okay!
Ross?
This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!
Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.
Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that 's-that's crazy-I mean that's crazy. So what's-what's going on with you? What is going on with you?
Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...'
I 'm just making margaritas.
Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
Hey!
Yeah I'm fine.
Rachel Green.
Miss, I can't let you off the plane.
I 'm all done.
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
Hey you!
So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?
Oh my God!!! Ross!!
Oh really?! You think you 're stronger? Why don't you prove it?
So whose is it?
Yeah, coffeehouse.
I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?
I 'm an actor, y'know? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!
Ooh, yeah! She said she 's having sooo much fun with Emily.
What d'you want?
Oh no Ross! This is not good, we have to talk about this Joey thing. Please sit.  You have got to get over this Joey thing, okay? I never really wanted to marry Joey, okay?
Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.
Awesome!
Fine.
Nothing.
No, no. He said  "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
I 'll be right there!  Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we've gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?
Yeah.
Who isn't?
Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it.
Hi.
She 's steaming her dress, why? What's up?
No!!
No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!
Yeah, y 'know. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. It'll be cute, okay?
Do you not see it?
Well, maybe you don't need them.

What?
I 'm sorry, let her?
Uh no, they 're still here but I think I'm about to leave.
That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but I am prepared to let that go.
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I 'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye.  I just did it.  I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it.
Then I won't have to kill you.
Oh God!
Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who 's going with who?
Ok I gotta tell ya, it's really weird when you use my whole name.
You play hard to get.
No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?
Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me,  'cause maybe I need to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now?
No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he 's gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
Hi, I'm Sally. So, no ring. Can I assume you are also a single parent?
One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, I'm dying on the gurney. Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want to go down there and say goodbye.
New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la...
What?!
They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next... la la la la la la.
Because she hates Pottery Barn.
Ooh, oh, oh, that's her.
No. You have got it completely wrong. John Savage was deerhunter, no legs, John Voit was coming home, couldn't feel his legs.
So far, I 've sold seventy-five.
I don 't know, maybe I can't. I mean, maybe there's something wrong with me.
Ohh, I thought that you....
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn 't seem so bad?
Hey!
I saw you.
By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.
I don 't know!   Yeah, I do.
Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.
I, er...
Dude! What is going on?!
Uh-huh.
Hey.
Yeah! Right!
Oh stop that!
Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don 't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck.
That 's just halftime, there's more of this.
Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
It 's good to see you man.
All right! Who's are they? Who's are they?
Tell him.
So it 's noticeable huh?
Are you worried your date came, saw you, and left?
Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me out here.
Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.
Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!
Hey!
Watch, watch.
Huh.
Yeah, he's the best.
That's really a day shoe.
Oh, hi!
Why? Who'd you seen him with?
Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind 've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose.
He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.
Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
Well, apparently he scares easy.
I can 't believe I still don't know what happened to the window in the attic!
What up?!
Earl Grey?
Yes. Not out loud.
Okay!
All right, it won 't go down any further. It's stuck.
I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
Oh, well you know who I love the most?
Yes, the Philange is fixed. As a matter of fact, we put a whole lot of extra Philanges onboard, just in case.
Wow! That was amazing!
I don 't know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.
Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!
That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.
The Metsss!
Oh that 's sweet. Don't touch me.
You were invited?!
You know what? Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here .
Well, so what're you gonna do?
No, just a Friday night.
No.
Oh my God!  Where the hell have you been?!!
Ciao, bela.
Pathetic mess? I know, but -come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching!  Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
Jan-Janice!
Yes, you can, very much.
Yeah! I don't think you're going to need it though. Okay, check this out. If it's a girl, Rain.
Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me.
Hi, is uh Phoebe here?
Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
Okay... Hey listen, just before you go I-I again, I just wanna say "thank you" for coming with me.
Professor Geller?
You're in!
Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?
Yeah.
I think you just have a cold, it's definitely not Strep.
Oh my god
Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh- u -a! Joshua! Josh.
When's that?
Man, I 'm starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that I 'm going to Florida for a couple weeks.
I really do.
Ugh.
Then we took a walk down to Bendall's , and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...
Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.
Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don 't want to take a break.
Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here.
Hey.
Good different?
OK, everyone gather up.
That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.
Oh, come on.
Wait, so, you're going?
It was just so awkward and bumpy.
Happy birthday.
What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.
Rosss...
Bye Ross.
Okay, umm, I 'm gonna get my sweater.
Okay. 'Cause this is where I wanna be, okay? No more messing around. I don't wanna mess this up again.
Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
Okay.
Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!
I 'm Irish.
Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.
Morning.
Hey, Ben! Hey!
Hey.
Okay.
Ok.
That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey.
Ross, there is no us, OK.
A pajmena?
You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there.
Well?
I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash;
Kathy 's with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!
I 'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
Hi.
What you do mean?
Uhh .
We can 't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it.
Yes! Did you see that?
You didn 't tell her did you?
Oh my God.
Dude that is so sad.
All right, well how much time do you need?
Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel?
It 's not looking good.
And look where they're sitting.
Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don 't!
Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.
Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!
Ohh, I don 't think so. I mean it would be different if it was way into the future -and-and-and we were getting married or something.
Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there.
No! No! No Ross! I 'm not hot! Are you hot?
I know  but they're just so beautiful! Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.
Really?!
Sounds good.
Yes sir.
Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
I think it's interesting.
What?
What?
I, I was just thinking about how much more we have to talk about.
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you!  Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
Okay.
Hello?
Yeah, we'll be okay.
You suck!!
Maurice.
Oh, Liam.
I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, I 'm so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. You're gonna have to tell me how you did that.
That's so sweet.
I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?
Oh no, I know I couldn 't see it either at first, but it's right umm  Ross, I lost it again.
Me too.
Oh. Okay! How can I help you?
It was a car backfire!
Marcel?
Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.
Right-right up here.
Thank you. I yeah.
Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!
Hey!!
Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look!  Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.
He took my essence!
Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...?  That slayed me.
How many did you want? I 'm getting a hundred.
All right. Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why don 't you tell us a little something about you Ross?
C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy,  Huh? Huh? Huh?
Have you seen him throw a ball?
He pulled a quarter out of my ear!
Well I 'm alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy bars, what do you think?
Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other. Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard. Oh God oh! Contraction!
Hey!
Oh? Really? That 's what my daughter means to you? Nothing?
Really? Excited?
No.
Listen, y 'know what? I was really freaked out too when I found out
Emily 's straight.
And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and  You go.
It's an expression.
All right, I promise. I 'll fix this. I swear. I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll talk to her.
No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.
What are you taking amoxicillin for?
Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?
Oh, I remember how we almost. Do you think we would 've gone through with it? Y'know, if we hadn't gotten caught. Do you think we would've done it?
You don't say.
All right, let's go Pheebs.
You 're about 80 percent effaced, so you're on your way. It still could last a little while longer. If you're anxious there are a few ways to help things along.
Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour.  That didn't happen, I made that up!
Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.
Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I 'm... I'm gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.
Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.
No, it 's a water balloon fight! We started it!
Ross, wants a pajmena?
... Ok, who is this?
Absolutely.
You got to tell me exactly what to do there.
That 's Carol with your son!
Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.
Oh you did, there are twenty in here.
Yes, I do.
Hi!
Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question.
Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.
I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can 't do it, they're all like-like laughing at me.
Y'know it 's ironic...
You think he 's emotionally unavailable?
Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.
You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny...
There. Now there is.
Hi, it 's me. I've been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.
This is your grandmother 's engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.

YAY! WHOO! YAY!
Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?
Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
Hey Ross!
"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"
Hi.
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear -you want it to be dirty?
Oh I was just thinking. You know what would be incredible? If you guys died.
See, I didn't know that.
No.
Yeah, it's fun .
But sadly I could not be enticed.
I am supposed to be the mommy?
Sure.
Hey!
And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....
Because if I go home, we 're gonna become the Bings! I can't be the Bings!
All right, buddy!
I get that a lot.
Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?
I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.
As in my grandmother.
Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
Really?
No!
Yeah, maybe...
You mean they're lovers.
Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn 't get it?
Are you serious?  Oh my God.
Hi!
Oh great!
Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
Oh, I made a little something. If I had more time to work on it, it'd be better, but..
We could write it down for you?
Ok, good!  You guys were so scared! There was no way I was gonna dump this... Oh God, no!  I think I broke your bowl.
Oh, honey that's awful.
And now you 're giving me the message!
It was really fun being married to you tonight.
Is he right? Am I really -Am I awful?
Oh dear God.
I wanna see it.
Sorry, sorry.
God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
Wow!!
Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?
Should I tell her I ordered tea?
No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
Hi.
Yep.
Whoa, for like months?
What?
Hi!
Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah. Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do.
Maye it's me.
So this is nice! I wish I didn 't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to.  Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?
Aren 't you with that girl over there?
I hope you 're going somewhere with this.
Hey, hold on a second.
Why-why aren't you more excited?
Oh my God, does she really thinks that?
What do you mean?
Ugh, she 's upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! I 'm not doing them this time! I don't care if those dishes sit in the sink until they're all covered with-I'll do them when I get home!
Hi!
Ross, where did you get this?!
Ross!
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.
I 'll be okay.
Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?
You were amazing out there.
Yeah. Ahh, here 's a box of your stuff.
I 'm next!
What're you gonna do, suck the door open?
Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay!
Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
Hey and look he brought flowers. Thanks Ross, but I 'm really more of a candy guy.
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
Oh well
Nobody likes change.
Oh, damn you Geller!
Thanks.
Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!
Ok, don't get me started on gravity.
Well that 's no way to sell newspapers. Why don't you try, "Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"
Good to see you too!
The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common with. You know what I mean?
Oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now! You can slip it under my door.
I can see why, nice shirt!
Well that was umm Okay.
Hey!
Well, I can't give you a massage, because my licence has been revoked again!
Did you just break the radiator?
Come on, show me.
Hey Ross, what 's going on? You changing the lock?
Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell or smoke.  Anyway, I was looking through it and I found "Science Boy"
Oh yeah? Did he pull the old
Bed?
Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol!
Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?
Oh wow! What now Ross you 're not gonna talk? How on earth will you ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know.  I mean you'd think the damn jalepeno would've cleared up your sinuses, but no!! That's not enough  What are you doing?!
Hello, Sir. You're here to return those pants?
Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.
What?!
What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
We were surprise that we weren 't invited.
Oh my God Ross!!
There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
Oh. Y 'know, he hums while he does other stuff to.
You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to the airport.
Hi.
Yes.
I don't know, I'm very tired.
Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?
Huh! Where is the dog?!
Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?
Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.
Umm, yeah, actually, Susan 's gonna be home any minute, it's kinda an anniversary.
And you know, I have a massage client soon.
Ahh.
That's because he's on your neck.
No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!
Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi!
I 'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!
Nooo!
A thousand bucks.
No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.
Yeah, definitely.
Hey, sweetums.
All right.
Actually what?
I can 't. I can't push anymore, I can't.
Ross, sweetheart!
Well, y 'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.
I love you too.
Sure.
Oh, are you sure you're ok?
Ohhh!
Hi!
Well better than you, but y 'know still not what you want.
Ross, she 's gonna start getting ready soon!
Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!
It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.
Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
We used them as pillows when we went camping.
I don 't know Ross! I-I tell you what, let's flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?
I will.
Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
Yep! You got the tickets?
Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.
Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
Hey, what time is it?
Once!!
Well, her memory is pretty much gone.
...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!!   Thank you, thanks.
Meeting Julie.
Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...
Oh, thank goodness!
Oh, we 're supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!
Ohh!!
Hey!
Yeah.
What Oh!
Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.
Good. Maybe he can switch it back.
Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you.
Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.
Well, it didn't say  "This is a virus"!!
This is how I would hold a football.
No he 's not! He's totally yanking your chain! He's done this with three other teachers!
I 'm sorry, is this the same Rachel who's name you said at the altar in the second marriage?
Hey!
What?!
There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind.
There. Here's their card.
Yeah, I guess that's true.
Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.
Really? Even more humiliating than
I 'm on it!
Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
What?!
Kills you?
Hi Ginger.
Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
Well, she 'll understand right? It's not like I did it on purpose.
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
There is not one hair on that head.
You can 't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So...
I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh.
No, she's out shopping.
Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be.
What?
I lent them to Ross.
No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can 't! I can't do it!  It's just gonna freak me out!!!
I could not have done this without you.
If that doesn 't keep kids in school, what will?
Oh, well, she 's asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.
Yeah. But a part of me also can 't wait 'til it's over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
Ross, can I talk to you for a minute?
But I...
Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
OK, gook luck.
Oh, it 's awkward. It's awkward. It's awkward.
Yes.
I 'd love some juice. Thanks.
Sure, sure.  What's with the chair.
Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.
Wow, Carol really messed you up!
Okay. I -But I think we should still have this conversation.
Hey.
Because, I can 't! Ross, I told you, no. I can't.
First of all, it's on your ass.
I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry.
It's allright! Crying is good. It lets the boo-hoos out.
Okay Ross that 's fine, but can you please stand near my head?
Oh no. No-no-no, don 't do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.
Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.
And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offered to help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you know out of nowhere Ross comes on to me.
Oh, wait Ross! I 'm sorry, one more thing!
All right now All right, you 're all set up. You're good to go. Just hit record. All right?
I understand that would be difficult.
Like what?
I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
I beg your pardon?
All I say is, she better get the job.
I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair.  All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.
I see. Have you considered therapy?
See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
Thank you.  Well, I guess we have some time to kill.
Maureen Rosilla.
Yeah right.
No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin!
Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?
You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!
Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so
Oh, that's um, interesting.
It 's okay honey, you'll find a name.
Oh, Monica, grow up!
yeah-yeah-yeah!!
Hey!
That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!
Hey!
Ross?
Did you not hear the plot of the movie?  "She's been dead for ten years." I'm gonna be a millionaire!
Yeah, there was. It was -there the corner of the library where- where all these dusty books that nobody ever read-Yes, there was.
Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this?
During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
Yeah, I didn't know that.
Oh yeah, there-there she is!
No luck huh?
This is all of your things.
Ohh, that 's too bad!
Bye!
So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?
Do I know why we 're rushing?
Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.
Oh please.
He doesn't do much, does he?
Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Sure, I know lots of girls.
I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.
I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.
Oh you went to the movies by yourself?
You were right.
Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father 's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!
Oh Ross.
Why would I be mad?
I'm so sorry.
Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.
Do you know why?
I know.
Yeah? What did ya have?
Whoa! And the...  huh-huh?
You did not go!
What?
I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet.
Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .
My mother 's still alive.
Come on, Chandler.
H-Hi!! And you are...?
I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
It's fine.
Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it!!
Honey I can 't even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I don't want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you're still his friend.
What?!
Well, we did a little more than that.
Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!
Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
This is amazing.
Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
Yeah, for you. Is that the list?
I can't watch this.
What!?
Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?
No, did we miss it?
Oh!
What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?
All right Ross you 're in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
But-but this block is like a whole other world.
Oh, please tell me it 's not because I'm going with Mark.
I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
Wow! She looks great. Doesn 't she?
Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
What?
It's a little complicated.
Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
Mmm.
Hang in there, it's gonna happen.
That's funny, we were doing the same thing!
Ugh! Women!
Mrs. Geller?
What?
I totally don 't know what you're talking about.
I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!
And?
Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
You have to go to London!
Alright Mr. Geller! Right this way! So, how dark do you wanna be? We have one, two or three.
Not even on page 7?
Oh God, I can't believe you're making such a big deal about this. It was one kiss, one guy, one time!
You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting.
She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.
Wow! This place is beautiful!
I don 't have it!
No, we didn 't get married! That's ridiculous!
You wear bi-focals?
Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That 's called a scrum, okay? It's kinda like a huddle.
Yes...
But! Don 't you have to give him his money back?
No it 's not, it's second.
....yeah... what else?
How are you doing?
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.
Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
Yeah. What time are you meeting her?
Y 'know, bonus night. Y'know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.
I can 't! It's too late! Terry already hired that girl over there.  Look at her, she's even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin....  swans.
You seem to really like her.
Space cowboy!
Ross, your little creature's got the remote again.
Come on, I don't know what else to do.
Ross, why don 't you give us your toast now?
Ross!
Yes, while I was in the chair! That 's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
Hey, c'mon, cut it out.
So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories?  No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you.  What do you say... want to waste another buck?
He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret.
Okay, I'm ready.
What?
It's ok that's how you feel.
Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?
Okay.
Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.
How-how about you each get five vetoes?
Well, that 's a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha .  I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah, they're all he talks about, why?
Yeah. Could you just sign right here please?
Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats.  Thank you! So what, you're just never going to tell her?
I missed most of the party  Charlie's a girl, right?
Yeah! I think that's great!
We were gonna go see the Jets!
Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous.
Wow!  Well then I 'll just have to carry you.
Wait, if that 's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?
Oh my God, how did you do that?
These are for Erica!
Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
Pizza!
Hey!
Monica.
Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?
Ross?
Is that supportive?
Guys?
11, unbelievable, 11 is correct.
What?
Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.
Yeah.
A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
Really?
Okay.
I wrote you a letter.
Yeah.
Well, maybe I can help.
Well, because of us! Because of our history.
What? You don't want me to get a job?
Heeeeey, where have you been?  What happened to you?
Y 'know how the garage floods every Spring?
Your mother's right. Take her, you can wear my tux.
Guess what?
Agghhh.
Oh no!
Sure.
Hey!
You remember that video I found of mom and dad?
The museum was amazing!
Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.
It's not cooler.
No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
Thank you.
No?
Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel.
Look, look!
What?!
Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good- bye!
So bad.
Oh honey thank God you 're home, I was getting worried.
18, uh?
No I didn 't!
Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
Duly noted.
Ross, um, don 't forget to get a shot of Emma's cake. It's in a box in the fridge.
Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.
No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.
No! No! I-I meant for the baby!
Really?
Uh, yeah, if you want too.
Yes! Green-blue!
All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing 's right. And that's what deathbeds are for.
In a month?
How crazy that we 'd run into you!
Hey!
How much longer?
Oh my God, has she slept at all?
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year,  "Dear Rach, you're such a good person." Not girl! Person!
What?
Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing. It was amazing. It was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that...
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry, it's just that when you moved your hands down to my butt, it was like woah, Ross's hands are on my butt. Sorry.
Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.
You kissed.
This place is awesome!
Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out.
And the bunny got away.
Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen.
Okay, they're just talking...
Yeah!
He 's fine!
Set....hike!
You don't trust him?
Chip, is Chip Matthews.
No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?
You were incredible!
Don 't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this.
Oh, you're so screwed.
Ohh! Okay!
WHAT!
Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.
So, thank you for the delicious dinner.
All right, look I 'm sorry you guys, but it's just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they're really expensive, y'know? I'm down to like three! Well, actually two 'cause one of 'em I kinda blackened in some teeth-Why did I do that?!
No!!
Are you going to do it?
Oh Amy, don't cry Amy.
You already hit on me an hour ago
Okay.
I'm comin' out!
Yeah, I know but
I'm gonna take her back to the appartment.
Okay well I think that's your answer.
Sorry!!  I just feel bad about all that sleep you 're gonna miss wishing you were with me!
I brought you back a present.
Is this about me taking your watch?
Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
No-no-don 't! Don't leave me here with these people.
That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.
You did.
You can tell us.
Because, he 's my friend.
He should take the sack?
A big idiot.
Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?
Hey-hey, Ross?
What do you mean? You've been in my room before!
Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!
Okay, okay, yes, it is.  How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.
I thought I had to make the jokes!
Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!
Hey, y 'know what? I'm not waiting! I'm gonna push this baby out! I'm doing it! I mean it's what? Three centimeters? That's gotta be like this!
I just can't stand you being here all the time.
No, I have some turning 21 to do.
Nooo!!
What-wh-what so we 'll just stay married forever?!
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.
Yeah, looks that way. First ones here! Wooo!!
Hey.
Is Monica here?
You told them he was missing?
She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!
Thank you, thank you very much!
Oh, let me see!  Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!
Why?
Yeah?
Just come.
Yeah!
Sure will. I've uh, gotta go. Take care.
Oh, yeah!
Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.
I guess I wanted to keep it  as a souvenir.
Well I mean, let me get the door first.  Oh, hi! No one.
No.
Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
Are you still mad at us?
So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve 's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, 'Doctor Monkey?' And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.
Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up with me. And besides, he's a very ethical man.
So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?
We're having a girl?
Fine! All right, I 'll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y'know, start to say something stupid.
Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?
Oh, you can have an accent and I can 't?!  Top 'O the morning to ya laddies!
Oh! Oh, I'm so happy.
Really? Why not?
Oh, I 'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
That 's the best one! Oh my God,  thank you so much!
Let's see what else he'll do!
How you doin'?
Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?
She.
Thanks for coming you guys.
It kills over one americans every year.
Hat, milk, got it.
Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.
There's no way in hell, I'm paying for it.
Umm, how 's it going with you guys?
You're a very sweet person Ross, umm, unfortunately I don't think I can take another second of you whining!!
Say it... say it!
I love you.
That is brand new information!!
Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.
All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
All right, we 'll start with apples.
I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew.
No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it 's no big deal, all right, I'm-I'm cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
Yes, Bunny?
You don 't have it anymore?
Okay, James.
When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! Isn 't that great?
Well I 'm gonna be on it this year. I'm gonna be one of the party people.
Okay!  Check it out!
From now?
Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.
Uh-huh.
Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
Ugh.  Ross!
Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.
Umm, well let 's see Monica and Chandler are occupied.
Ross.
I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it?  ..Ross?
Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...
What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!
I'd rather not.
Oh... Italy, I think.
Ok. Oh God.  Get the camera, it 's in the diaper bag.
Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.
Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right?  Okay, great.  You freak.
Oh, it went amazingly well!
Who 's next?
Ross, nice to meet you.
I 'll always remember that summer, because it's when I got all of these freckles.
Yes! Yes, you 're back in the lead!
You are right there with Emily. And it 's y'know, it's kinda like . it's a tie! Well, I gotta get, I gotta get back to the dishes.
Yes, yes Monica is thin. It's wonderful. But what we really want to hear about is Ross's new girlfriend.
So, are you a member of any gym.
Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!
Wh
Okay..
What?! You say that to kids?!!
And you're okay with that?
No. No. But I 'll go see a normal person movie with ya.
Vicrum?
Just tell her the truth! Tell her you 're not ready.
Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?
Looks like someone IS the ladies!!
Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
I always loved that!!
Oh!
Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
Oh, they're real!
I 'm sorry.
I like Ross.
She won a thousand dollars!
I call Godfather!
Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.
Honey see, it doesn 't mean that I don't love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it's-it's for me y'know, I'm out there, on my own, and I'm doing it and it's scary but I love it, because it's mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?
You're not gonna like it.
Wait, I 'm-I'm sorry. What's the big deal about a holiday card?
Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!
Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
I think it's sweet.
Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.
A guy who won two.
Hi.
Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.
This is the boarding call for Flight 009.
Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?
Oh, you 're not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back!
Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as you want.
You be okay?
Just get away from me!
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!
Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!
Well, that would 've been very hard to say no too.
Oh... Yeah, you do.
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!
Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
That's how they do pants!
Yes! Yes! You did!
No.
Oh, y'know what? Forget it, you already gave me an A.
Chocolate-chip pancakes!
Nope, nope, that's it.
Yeah.
Oh my God! I 'm going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can't make lunch.
Can I talk to you for a second?!
Yeah!
Yay!
No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!
What?
Actually I did it Ross. You remembered shockingly little of your own speech.
We're ok.
And I 'm Rachel, an admirer of the building.
Listen Ross, you don 't have to apologize. I understand why you were there.
They all had a thing for him.
Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.
You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!
No! We 're gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
Ohh wow! I 'm sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
Oh, well get in line missy.  So, can I have a ride stud?
It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.
Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?
Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.
Ohh, okay.  Wh-Ah-ha!  Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can't do it.
No, I think it 's very obvious who's wrong here.
God she is unbelievable.
Hi, sure!
But, it's not raining.
Oh. Well good!  For me.  What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?
Hey you guys?
What do you mean?
Wait! Where 's my shoes?
I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.
Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
This may surprise you, but re-hiring fired employees, is not my main job.
You bitch. You just think you're so perfect. With your new baby and your, your small apartment.  <directs this to Ross who in turns throws the towel in his hand down on the table> Well let me tell you something. Your baby isn't even that cute.
Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?
Well, Chandler and I used to make out! A lot!
So, I love you.
Oh, I 'm sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
My father had an heart attack...  ...while I was at Barney's.
I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment?
Oh my God! Is that him?
...He's in.
What?!
Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica 's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
Hey!
Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!
And well, what did she say?
Why?
Irrational, huh? All right, well, I 'll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!
Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are!
Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
Oh, uhm, excuse me, I'm here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green.
Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross, this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.
Hey! Where have you been?
Hey!
Hey all right, Ross came as doody.
I know
I do. I really do. I don 't know anything.
Excuse me. . That didn't make us sound gay at all!
Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he 'd ever heard.
Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it 's been twelve years.
Uhh, Chandler's not here.
Okay, everything looks good. Here it is on the screen.  Here is your uterus. And right here is your baby.
Well, you could actually go to the gym.
Now wasn 't Joey hitting on her at the wedding too?
Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty.
Oh that 's five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesn't she want to come out?
I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
Yeah.
What? Who?
Awful, absolutely awful.
No, let me explain! Fired!!
Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room!
Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
Thanks.
Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there!  That was my agent.  My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
Oh my God.
No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy.
Monica 's chicken parm! I'll take care of it.  Hey Mr. Treeger, it's Joey Tribbiani. Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandler's apartment. It's an emergency.  Uhh, gas leak! Yeah oh, and bring garlic bread.
But Joey, I don 't think Ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. I mean--Or he does.
All right, uh  Oh hey, you 've done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
Ohh, with who?
Totally. I had sex in High school...
No! Not at all!
I was just going to say that I left my keys.
Who cares? Nobody reads those things
So what's new with you, uh, knocked up any more of my daughters lately?
What?
Okay, but this can 't be good for the baby.
I got beer.
Hey!
Thank you.
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.
Dr. Geller, Kurt Rathman, I 'm a professor in the paleontology department here.
I just wanted to come by and y 'know, wish you good luck on your date.
Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
Oh yeah, it 's beautiful country up there.
Hey.
I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her!
What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.
Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.
You obviously can't keep away from her.
Hang on a second I just got in.
Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the booth, and...
Both of you?
Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn 't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
As much as they love you?
Correct! Which monarch has ruled Great Britain the longest?
It could 've been worse, he could've shot her.
Whadja think?
Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here.
Don't tear it.
oh I dunno I dunno, you know I mean I like him but am I ready to take my grade a loins off the meat market.
Ross will do it.
But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle, y 'know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out.
Whoa, how do you know about that?
Thank you.  Oww!!!! God!
I 'm sorry, I do that.
If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then I'm joking!
And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?
Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe.
I didn't see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.
Okay. Okay.
Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?
Uh-uh-uh, right now? Because I 've kinda got an el fresco situation going on over here.
There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.
Okay, here 's batch 22. Ohh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
I don't think mine likes me either.
Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
I can 't believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?
I certainly see what the girls like coming here.
Good idea! Yes!
Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go!   You didn't get the annulment?!!
It's mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like "yeah, right, well what else is new?"
If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They 've been taping those people up there all day.
Oh, so you 're already doing your part for the kids.
You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.
Wow! Look at this!  I can 't believe I even fit into this shirt!   Oh, this is yours.
I didn 't have to, because I was wearing my 'I heart Ross' sandwich board and ringing my bell.
Yeah.
So okay what? You 're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?!-Op, woman! Sorry.
No.
Ok, careful, ok.  Oh, she 's smiling! Oh my God, she does like it!
Wow.  Good speech.
Y 'know what? Let's, let's talk later.
And then my wife and I went on a cruise to the Galapagos. There was a sea food buffet you wouldn't believe. There were clams, and mussels, and oysters, and cracked crab, and snow crab, and king crab. It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish.
One hour.
I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
One uh, vegetarian pizza. That's $12.15.
Ow...Oh Gosh!
Ugh, I hate this year!
Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?
You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed!
Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.
No, we went to the left.
Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.
YAY!
I can 't believe you won't just admit it!  Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.
Ohh. What is this?
Yeah, what 's your point?
Oh, yeah! Ooh, that 's nice.
I confronted her, and she didn 't deny it!  I don't live here!
Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....
Bye.
Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
No! I'm sorry, we were looking for  "Baby It's You". Baby It's You.
Little bit, yeah.
Oh no, I think I 'm gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.
Hey!
Nope!
Oh Emma. This is going to be your first Thanksgiving. What are you thankful for? Mommy's bobbies.
I don 't want you to see me naked!
Ah, you... have the sex?
Okay! I 'm ready.
You 'd think that would embarrass me, but you see I'm maxed out.
I 'm just going to say hi to the lads. All right?
And we 'll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.
Okay, stop what you 're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....
Oh b-b-but it is!
Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?
This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I 'll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right.
I called him.
Mine!
How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?
Ross, can you pass me the yams?
You 're doing it again.
Ross.
Did she go out with him?
Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table.
Well...
All right, I know you 're hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but don't say that again.
I know, but I don 't think that's what she wants.
All right I 'll have one.
Thank you so much for letting me do this. Public bathrooms freak me out, I can't even pee, let alone do
The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.
It's your favorite sister.
Well, yeah, this is the deal.
Yes I am!
Oh, this is it. This what 's gonna kill me.
Oh, I I d-
Oh no! Oh no!
Um, can I come back in?
So what are you gonna do?
Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...
I don 't want them to move to a Volvo dealership!
You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.
I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
It got caught on my watch.
Why don 't you get in the hot tub and I'll meet you there.
What?
What?
So whose ring is it?
Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?
I 'd be happy to.  You are very sweet.
All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.
He is very sweet. Plus he's hot!
Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.
All right!!
But, but, Mona, I live here.
Y'think?
What, so I gotta shut it down now?
Bye.
Hey!
I can 't believe Mark didn't call. It's Sunday night, and he didn't call.
Popular.
'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?
Well it 's gone.
Marc Coreger, this is my wife Julie.
Triscadecaphobia.
Ok.
What are you doing here, Geller?
What was all that about?
Ross, if you don 't tell them, then I will!
Does, um, anyone wanna see?
No.
Oh look, look there 's your old makeup kit!
Yeah.
I've probably been talking too much. Why don't we talk about you a little bit?
Uh, there's a drunk Chinese guy.
Oh wow.
Ross! Come quickly! There 's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
Shoot! I can 't go, I have to work!
Die Hard!!!!!!
I can 't speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship.
Right.
Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall.
You spit on me man!
Oh, look, he's waking up!
So what are you gonna do?
All right.
My boyfriend canceled on me. I mean.. I I finally find a real relationship. I mean, someone that I can spend this day with and then his wife comes back into town. I swear, its almost not worth dating married guys.
I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture.
So, did you pick one yet?
You miss your girlfriend?
What?
Oh-oh, what are you doing?
It 'll be great for next weekend.
Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.
fellas
Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number.
Hi!
What?
What is up?
Who invented bifocals?
I don't know all the words.
Aren 't you in my Popular Culture class?
Yes, we should. I think we should.
It 's All Relative.
No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.
Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song.
What is it...?  Please...?
I don 't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
Great! Well, it was nice meeting all of you.
Oh, come on! I think he 's ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
What?
Are you okay, sweetie?
Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.
Is everything all right, dear?
What?
Mhm-mh!
Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
Well, what did you say to her?
What?
...Ross?
Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?
Let's see!
I know isn 't it? It's like I'm right there with Joshua.
Again?!
And Monica knows...
Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.
It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.
Maybe.
I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol.
Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year 's Eve 1997.
No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure!
I just got off the phone with my sister.
Me? I 'm great! I'm fine! I'm sooo good!! But, you know who's not great?! Men! You're a man right Ross?!
Yeah.
Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand.
Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.
Oh... That's true.
You were?
Look, Ross, you have what you want, you 're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth.
Ross!
Fine!
If anything should happen to him
Oh no problem, maybe I 'll play with my left hand.
Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself.
You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?
I'd wait.
Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard!  Howard! Howard! Howard!  Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard!  Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Yay!!
You were staring about eight inches south of there.
Yeah, it 's not. But I'm rich and thin.
Oh, you're back...  this is my wife, Nancy.
Hey Ross! Doesn 't Ben go to the Smithfield Day School?
Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...
Hey
Hey!
Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe Phd.
Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman!  What 's this?
Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate!
Shake it!
Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great. It's certainly the easier choice...
Oh, I wouldn 't miss it for the world.
All right, let 's get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.
All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.
Are... are you OK?
That's what we decided.
Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?
Thanks, Ross.
It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!
We don 't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.
Have a nice six more months Ross!
Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y 'know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.
I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.
Yeah, a woman I went to college with just became the first female blacksmith down there.
No-no-no, no. I'm going to talk. I believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun.
Is the window open? Because if there's a window open, a bird could fly in there.
Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed
I do know.
Thanks!
Dangerous Liaisons.
Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I 'm just glad we didn't do anything stupid.
OH! Oh, oh!
Just one? I drive you all the way down here, and I don't get to see how it works out?
Anyway, it uh look it'll just take me a while to get over her, that's all. I'm not even sure how to do that, I mean I've never been in love before so
Yes, it's twins!
Uh-huh.
Oh Ross!!
This isn 't how it's supposed to go, there can't be another guy.
So, I guess you're next. You're ready?
Newark airport. Why, where are you?
Really, I shouldn't feel guilty?
Hi!
Oh, wait a minute it 's not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!
Well, I'm very impressed.
Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?
Ah, well, unless it's the creepy guy with his hand up his kilt, I'm gonna say congratulations!
Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.
Ross, take me off speakerphone.
Its a girl?
It's a... It's good to meet you! Thank you so much for taking the time out to show me around.
Are you sure you wanna do this?
'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.
Well, did-did you correct him?
Is-is-is that message old or new?  Old or new?! Old or new?!
Are you gonna be okay?
Hey! Hey Adrienne.
Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your wedding, but I don 't-can't get up.
This is totally your fault!
Of course she would, you're a college man.
Oh, poor baby.
You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.
Monica 's pregnant.
No, I just talked to them.
Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one who has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received.
All right, all right. Let 's go!
Rub it.
Oh. Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person. Big deal. Besides, it 's kinda fun hiding.
Hey, you guys!
I can 't. I keep seeing it the good way.
Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.
Ross gave it to me.
Why is Ross naked?
Can you believe how lame this is?
What's in the bag?
Thank God you 're here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?
No-no.
Hey!
Alright thanks, oh Ross could you stop by the coffee house and get me a muffin?
-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!
yeah I've nothing to be ashamed of ok so I haven't been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. Ok I haven't had a real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave. which he will and that's ok. so I'll just be alone forever you know alright I'll be. it'll be fine. it'll be fine. I'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians. Oh
And that horrible museum tour!
Do you know how fast you were traveling back there?
What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
Where have you been?
So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing is...
Just washing the windshield.
Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with...
Hey!
Here we go! Okay, keep pushing! Wait! I see something.
Would you tell her I let you win please?
And say what? "You owe me a goodbye", I mean, he's got more pride than that.
Hey, hey Ross.
Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.
Oh! Oh, God!
No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
I'm sorry...  Ross Geller... Benjamin Hobart.
You okay?  You all right?
Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"?  No? Divorce?
Nope.  Man look at this! Ross, I can 't believe you said you'd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!
Then it's okay!
Oh, stop that, stop that right now.
Okay, it must just be me then.
Nancy Thompson 's getting fired!
He says he wants to leave the country.  He thinks you hate him.
1 minute 50 seconds.
But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together.
Why?!
Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
Take thee, Emily...
No.
Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it!
Why...why?
Oh, he's just goofing around.
Good luck.
What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!
You dog!
You wanna touch it?
Does anyone wanna watch TV?
Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
Oh, you are the, uh... paleontologist.
I know, I lied! I didn 't want her to think I was a terrible mother! I can't even see my own baby!
I can 't!! I can't!!  Noooooooo!!!!!!! You son of a bitch!!!!!
Yeah! Why?
Right over there! Right there! Look-look-look!
Okay, what's up?
Oh, little party favours, check it out!
Oh what then? Kick me?
Richard!
Check if it 's wet, check if it's hungry, burp it!
I 'm sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I'm sorry but that's...  Oh my God!!
Oooh.
Ohh
Give me a 'for instance'.
That's like a woman wanting to be a...
Och, god.  Oh, thank god, you're okay. I'm so sorry we left you. Mom never gonna leave you again. Never ever ever again. Uch.
Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous?
Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.
what's up is Phoebe ok?
Ross, my father doesn 't hate you.
Oh, I didn 't, I didn't know that.
Saving, saving, saving me from the pleasant conversation with the interesting man, saving me?
Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi--
Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
Oh really? That 'd be great! You guys can be the contestants!
Molly ... people don't study acting ...
Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
Don 't say, "Oh my God!" Oh my God what?
I just talked to Joey, I just -I want to see how you were.
Hi! Oh, Ross, don't forget, we have that doctor's appointment tomorrow!
Are you okay? What 's wrong?
He 's looking at me.
I know! Hey, how 's Chandler doin'?
Yes!!
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
No you don't.
I don 't know.  What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.
I can 't believe mom and dad are selling the house!
Oh, I know. Hey, y 'know what we never did?  Oh no, not that.  We uh, we never had bonus night!
Hey, kids.
Oh, wait, wait, wait! Here they go again.
C'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun.
All right. I'll come to New York and we'll try and make this work.
See?
Ish. I just don't think I can bear it.
'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
Yeah, what the hell did I know!
Thanks Ross.
Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this  I don 't really know what that means.  You were saying?
Uh-oh.
That was you!
The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
Excuse me Mr. Mexico.
Good.
Oh.
Argh!
What? I don 't get it.
Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
Just so you know... With us... it's never off the table.
Y'know what, that 's fine, maybe you haven't grown up, but I have.
It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.
Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that 's why you have got to be the bigger man here.
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
Petty...
Worse?
You spent a hundred dollars. That 's the limit. You're screwed!
What? What are you gonna do?
Dad!!
Oh, I know.
Oh God, absolutely.
I can 't believe you're not going to propose!
Yeah, they're great seats too!
What? Why?!
That's easy, baggage claim.
Oh my God! I don 't believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.
I 'll take a coffee.  So how was your big date last night?
Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
What? I 'm not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing.
Oh, that's pretty.
Yeah it is, it is.  We really, really have to do something about that.
Good different?
Da Da.
You too.
Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
All right Chandler, you 're up.
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
Good.
Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!
Hi!
Oh! It 's you.  Hi.
Ah, a little preview!
Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?
Rob Tillman!
Actually, we already found a house we love.
Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name!
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
Whoa!  I kinda liked it.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
Oh, but the party 's only just getting started!
Chandler, look they 're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.
Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn 't go with Mark?
When certain people leave the table and I am not finished!
It's open.
Okay, I 'm not gonna have one.
Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.
Ah, all right. Here's to Ross!
Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel 's sister's cabin.
Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.
You know what, I think we've had all the bad luck we're going to have.
What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!
Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
I just, I feel, I-I just...
Okay, let 's talk outside.
Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!
Ross!
Uh... November?
Uh-huh!
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
A part of him did yes.
Oh hi!
Thing?
Uh Ross? You asked me that.
Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross!
Uh... yeah, why?
Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
Definitely
Okay! All your tests look fine. Now, are you two interested in knowing the sex of the baby?
Okay, great!
Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
We've gotta go, we've got that cab waiting.
Hi!
Oh, I don't know.
Hey.
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
Okay...
Oohh, I love it!
Yes!
Okay, I do.
Oh it... good! Yeah, but I'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days.
Oh that 'd be great. Sure!
Take thee, Emily...
Alan.
Yeah, we 're gonna go.
I tried, but apparantly singing  "I will survive" in a helium voice \- not helping.
Ooh... Not so good.
Why is everything different?
No matter how much we want it.
No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.
Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
I got to figure out what I 'm going to wear.
Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria 's Secret catalogues, not a gym!
Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.
Of course we're hitting faces, why wouldn't you hit faces?
Yeah, you don 't want that.
Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.
Oh we-we didn 't.
Wow, those pills really worked, huh?
Hey.
Yeah. That 's Daddy.
No, she's at a faculty meeting.
You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!
What?
Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!
Ok...
What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
Yeah.
I mean think about all the money that you 're gonna make!
Not even one more time?
Sure, I'll go check on Emma.
I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky.
Thanks.
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too.
He's under sedation, so he's pretty much out.
What're you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel?
What?
No, that would be,  "Why are you being cute?"
Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me up.
No, no, no.
I just- I don 't think us getting back together is a good idea.
Learn about Jesus...
All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing incident... when I was little.
You think you 're gonna get out of this on a technicality?
What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
She was a drug dealer!
Why not?
Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
No no no, behind it.
Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, it 's really hot.
Bye.
He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.
So...Thank you.
Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.
Hey, I've been honing!
Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
I went.
You said girl!
I'm crazy about her.
Says who? Your mom?
Ok, who ordered what?
Come on! I don 't want you thinking of me like that any more!
Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes  Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird turtle-man?
Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!!  You wanna go shotgun?
Ross! That's Mark. From Bloomingdales? You were insanely jealous of him.
Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor!
It won't come off!
Okay, are you aware unagi  is an eel?
I 'm so sorry.
Yeah!!
Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
What?
You didn 't!
...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you 're not gonna be on TV!
Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but...
I'm not a baby, you're the baby.
I don't have travel insurance.
Right.
Look man!
Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
What are you guys doing?
Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to
Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!
So I'm thinking about you. So what?
Oh, y'know what, I didn 't want cinnamon on this.
Okay, what do you guys think?
You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?
Okay.
You must be so happy!
Hi.
Poco... a leetle.
I know what your problem is.
Well thank you, you too.
Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.
Good bye Ross.
Okay.
Let's show 'em.
We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part.
It didn 't click.
Ross?
Whatever.
Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y 'know that if I'd work with stocks, I'd have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.
Nothing.
Professor Geller?
For every night that you 're asleep before I get home from work...
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
"I'm a little bit country"...
It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn 't, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go!
Hey! Which one 's my turkey burger?
It really was. You've learned some new moves!
that's why she was weird.
Bye!
I think I accidentally used Monica 's boxes to keep the water away from the Porsche.
It 's picture time.
All right, me too.  Should we wake her up?
Yeah, what was wrong with your old human teeth.
What do you see? What do you see?
I know. You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today?
What, you guys really think that I 'm that shallow?
Steps!  Slut!  You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
I had too okay?! We 're getting married! Married couples can't keep secrets from one another!
Wow, really?
Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.
All right, we 'll call you when we get back.
Oh, y 'know what? It's probably just your burnin' loins.
Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.
Umm, this is great wine.
Because I 'm normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
Sorry. Sorry.
Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!
Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?
Dr. Geller, there 's a seat over here.
Oh, I gotta go back in there.
Why?
Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...
Ugh! I don 't know what I'm going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don't care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is?
No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!
What?
Oh, he 's fine. He's fine. It's just that us getting along is difficult for him, because he doesn't like me.
The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.
Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?
Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
Can we do it again?
Okay, excuse me for a minute.
Actually, I'm a... kind of a.... you know, a... date-type... thing... of Rachel's.
No.
Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner.
Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
You think it looked amazing?
Hey!
No, no no no, don't need to know the details.
I 'll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.
This is so great.
See? They're as different as night and... later that night.
OK, OK.
One swift kick and he 'll back off.
Sandwiches!
A lesbian?
No, he really said it.
You too. Last night was just wonderful.
Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but... Susan
What?!  What the hell?!
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
By someone besides Monica?
Uh huh! If it's a girl, Phoebe, and if it's a boy, Phoebo!
Well, that 's not something a girl wants to hear.
Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
No Ross!!  Don 't! You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn't work that way. It doesn't just make it better. Okay?
Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night.  Where exactly were around ten-ish?
Breathe.
What, like a number?
I got it!
We're having a girl.
I can't think of anything.
Yeah, complicated  'cause of the love.
Yes! Ross, you have to stay!
Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.
Oh, thanks. So, uh, what are you gonna do this summer?
Hi!
Oh yeah! With who?
Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town!  Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!!  I mean, way to go Ben!  Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.
Thank you, Ross.
Well actually
Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson.  Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!
It's my baby too.
It doesn't say that. Does it?
Yeah, little Eric.
Isn't there any way you can keep him?
Why not?
Hey you guys I 'm gonna take off. I just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye.
Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I 'm also really psyched 'cause I don't have to move in here!
No..!
Hey!
Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
God?
Hey.
It 's okay. Sometimes, things don't work out the way you'd thought they would.
It 's not that far! Just drop!
I don't know. What are you wearing?
Ohh, wait a minute, we haven 't pre
Ah, so what are we looking at?
You got it.  You got Nevada twice.
What 's too much fun?
Oh that's so cute
Man, I am so beat.
You 're so sweet! And I'm so surprised!
Hey, my favorite part is coming up!
Hey!
Make it stop!!
Rehearse it!
Right!
Is Joey Tribbiani here?
Ross..
So, what do you think?
Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didn 't I didn't propose!
Well, what is the truth?
Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?
Shut up, Joey!
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.
Hello.
No, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, if anything, I think this could help you. You know what? Why don't we all go out to dinner together, and I can introduce you.
Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...
Uh huh.
Hey.
Thanks.
Oh.
Looks good, uh?
That's great!
Yeah, like a chimney.
Ross...
C'MON!
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
Mommy, what's wrong with that man?
Ouh
Hey.
I 'm telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!
How come you didn't come over earlier?
I can't. I can't do it, I can't marry Mindy. I think I'm still in love with you.
Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.
Hey!
Bye! Thank God
Yeah, we are.
I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical.
Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.
Now that you 're on you're own, you're free to look as stupid as you like.
Oh. Oh! I can do it!
It does. It really and truly does.
Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!
But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do... Ah, it's not true, there is... nothing I want to do.
Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat -I don't want to talk about it.
You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
It's called the cherry.
Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!
Hi.
Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.
Breathe.
All right, we should call somebody.
All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.
No, it's been three nights in a row.
Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon.  I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.
Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
Yeah that 's true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.
Hi.
Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.
You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! I 'm gonna kill you!!
Hey!
Hmmm... this is so nice.
Wait! We need shoes!
Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.
Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?
All right Ross!! I get it!!
What?! What else did he say?
Yes I'm gonna put it back  exactly where I found it.
What?!
Five years.
Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play.
Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.
I'm just serving it.
Nothing!

I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance.
Oh God. Ross, OK, if you care about me at all, you will get the pie out of the man's hood.
Yeah!
Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?
Crazy, or... romantic?
Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!
How can you do this too me?! I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear!
Oh Ross, you're so great!
We could not, would not want to wait.
No please, show me how I begged you!
Oh my God.
Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.
Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister.
What?!
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them.
I mean, look-look today you escaped   death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?
My hamster. I hope she's okay, I haven't seen her in a while. Have a seat.
You know what I really really want?
No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!
That must have been hard.
I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out.
That 's not gonna work out! Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, "Oh that's okay. You'll find someone." And then, bamn! She finds you!
Oh, you 're switching apartments?
ÃÃ¡Ewww!
Your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. That's all I know.
You two will have very hairy children.
I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.
No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.
Colorado.
Look, the point is, there 's a lot of women out there you haven't even had sex with yet!
I did that too! They wouldn 't give me her real name or her number. They said, "If I bothered them again they'd call the police." I said, "If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring!"
I want to go on a ride along!
You got Rachel pregnant?!
Yeah.
Unbelievable!
Hey Ross. It 's Joey. There's a hooker over here and we thought maybe you'd know something about it.
Ohh
Oh, hello Ross!
Wow. So, what did you guys do?
It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-
I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
When was the last time you saw her wear it?
All finished!
Yeah, why not.  So I told her.
She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
Yes, it was.
He 's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
Yeah.
Thank you! I had just gone to the beach that weekend.
Yeah... Now I have something...
You 're right.
Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.
Hi!
You do? Why?
Could you please get her attention?
My cousin's a paleontologist.
Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow!  Love to love ya, baby!  Darnit!  Ugh.
Mon?
Ok, maybe you're right.
You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.
Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like,  "Awww, he's got a Ross."
No, it's not that. I got fired today. And I didn't get the other job.
That's some gentle comedy, dude.
All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won 't recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I.  You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I'll be uh, Mr. Wong.
Hmm-hmm.
Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
So what do you, what do you do now?
I've been here the whole time!
Then why didn 't you tell me to do that?!!
What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well? What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot.
Look no, I-I know it 's bad, and I know it's wrong. Okay? But-but it's not like anything's ever gonna happen. Y'know? These-these are just feelings, they're gonna go away.
ÃÃ¡Mira, mira, el viejo desnudo estÃÃ¡ haciendo el hula hoop!
It's my New Year's resolution!
It 's my joke.
Because you 're the only one that can be fair.
I'm pregnant.
Thanks!
Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?
Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
I just feel awful.
Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.
Come on! You 're just titling!  Her legs are fine!
Do you really see this as a long-term thing?
Hi.
Goodnight.
Hey that 's okay. So, where do you want to go?
Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom and dad this year?
Okay, but Ross just listen to me
Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let 's talk about it!! How was she?
Nude... ... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.
No!
Oh really?
Oh well, they 're killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.
Yeah!
That sounds great! I 'd love to live at Warren's!! I love Warren! Thank you!
Tongue?
No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.
Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?
No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?
I'm not! We're having a girl! Sometimes I can't believe it's with you-But still! We're having a girl!
Oh now -Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?
No, no, no.
Hey.
Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!
Uh-oh.
Oh, that 's okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.
Ross, that's my jacket.
I mean, was it Gina?
Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.
Yes. I like Rachel.
Yeah! All right! You go first.
I will wake you up in a way that 's proved very popular in the past.
Emma.
Five.
It's really gone?
All right, look, here 's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
It 's All Relative!!
No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on.
Hello!
Oh God! I gotta go!
Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.
So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!
I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don 't want him complimenting my thing.
Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?
Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you 're having sex with him.
Face to face, yeah!
So umm, does it?
Do you want us to leave the room, or?
Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got!  This is my "Please, hire me" sweater.  And these are my, "Don't you want to rent me this apartment?" pants.
But you got to be with both of them, right?
And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?
Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
Marcel, I'm hungry.
Oh uh I actually came here to ask you out.
Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel.
No we weren 't!
After you.
Oh, I know it. You 're right. That's not sexy. Oh Oh!  Whoops! Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bed over and get it.  Oh God!
Well, I 'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word.
No you stop!
Oh thank god, if Phoebe's going, can we please take Emma home?
I know!
Yes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane!
Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!
Hugh! Hugh Grant!
Shut the book!
See what you did.
Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while.
That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy.
Hey, you keep pushing me on this, my foots going to meet the middle of your ass.
Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.
Exactly.
Right, and the humiliating.
No.
We don't, we don't wrestle now.
This almost never happens!
You want a piece of me, sir? Is that what your saying?  You want a piece of me?
Oh great!
Okay, uh sit down.  Um there's this woman that I like. A lot. But, uh it can't happen.
I wanna hear  "The Sound."
So what are you guys going to do?
You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.
Hey, Ross, want some cider?
Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you 're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?
You 're welcome.  I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
I can't believe you did that.
Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.
I 'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
You're gonna what?
Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...
Excuse me... This hospital is for people!
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
Didn 't you two already talk?
Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.
Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?
Yes! There's still pie.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!
No, not really. You 're pressing the baby into my bladder and now I have to pee. Sorry.
Okay.
Hey!
Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
How could you mess this up? It's so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!
Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
No no no. Talk... dirty.
Okay, bye!
Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
Hey! I brought you some house warming gifts.
But...
Hi sweetie!
I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I...
I 'm an alien. I'm an alien.
Ben, its Rachel!  But whatever.
Thanks.  Great so we can all go together! I gotta run. Catch you later!
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
Why?
Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then M-B-O...
I didn 't know Playboy prints jokes.
Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in my life.
Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. Why don 't you tell me what happened.
Hi!
Oh, I 'll-I'll be fine. Just God I hate her Ross! I hate her!
I don 't think you understand packing. Look, I just don't want to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here.
Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday?
Oh please, you inhale your food!
Pretty good! I told her.
Ross, why didn 't you tell me that?
Or not. Uh, Rach, why don 't you just move in with me?
Oh no, what happened?
Ross play rugby? I don 't think so.
Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I know we 're not supposed to see each other anymore and I'm okay with that, it's just that I don't know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to about it.
Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.
It 's okay! It's okay! It kicked once, it'll kick again!
Hey, hey, and I'm in the movie.
There she is!
Yes, I did! And you are welcome!
All right, you two, stop it!
Hey!  What happened to you? Why didn 't you come up?
After the snap!
Yeah, you still have feelings for me. And-and to be honest, I-I still have feelings for you. And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we can 't. It's too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just It just wasn't meant to be.
How about those three pointers?
Ohh, of course Monica 's brother!
Okay
Oh, hi!
Thank you.
Oh no, I can 't go. I'm practicing; I got an audition to be the host of a new game show.
Ross, what's the matter?
Honey, I was wondering....
Yeah right!
You know when "That's fine" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!
I did!
Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn 't Rachel.
Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!
Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing.
Oh yeah it is! I 'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.

Oh, you know what?
It 's not that kind of anniversary.
I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
Dude, I screwed up, you don 't have to turn me in!
Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?
The man is showing brain.
Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?
But what if uh -and I'm not saying she will be-But
Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?
Ross, are you okay?
Chandler told me.
No!
What?
Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
Well, I haven 't discussed it with him yet, but I know he's gonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.
Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I would like them to bond.
Yeah.
You, you, you said he liked me.  You, you slowpokes!
I actually needed to talk to you before the birth.
Yes, the hard part is truly over.
You 're kidding! And he plays rugby?! That's so funny.  Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.
Oh Ross!
I don't sound like that.
I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you.
Well that 's his last name.
Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?
It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken.  Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson.
Oh, you know, wait. I do have one question.  Do you guys do random drug testing?
dammit!
Ross! Stop that!
Hey, who's this little naked guy?
Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?
You 're gonna be a great father.
Oh, this terrible! Eve rything is destroyed! Look at this.  It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don't even know what it is! Ohh, it's still soft.  What do you think this is?
Hey! Ross!
Oh, my God! She has food delivered here?
Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
Oh, everything's pink.
Hey!
How are ya man?
The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.
It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.
I know!
Well, then...Let's.
Well, this has been great!
I'll get it.  Hello? Ross's place. Mike speaking.  It's for you.
I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job! And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee -ahh!! Ross, we need to talk.
I believe it.
Hi! So I 'm out having lunch at Monica's and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale 's and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he's gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!
Are ya getting married?
That you 're not funny or sexy?
Who is also in charge of purchasing.
Cool, thanks.
I know. It's just such reckless spending.
C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?
Hi guys!
Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video.
You wanted to see me Professor Geller?
What?
God, what is wrong with me.
I gotta get one, too.
You, you want me to help you with that?
You're kidding, no!
Yeah. We'd go to the science lab after hours!
Yeah, it takes two incomes.
Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming...
And uh, Liam, Liam 's got bad knees. You hit him right and he'll go down like a lamp.
Hey.
You won't even taste it?
Because a car backfired?
Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
Seriously, where did this happen?
Dude, none of this is cool.
No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.
I used to love to play restaurant.
What?
Okay, you got it.
I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
Ohhh!
So you didn 't leave the bank?
Ross, you know what...
Hey!
Toll-booth.
Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually,  she should be here by now.
Oh hey! Wait up!
Oh, little  'X's! Great! That makes up for everything!
Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.
Ross?!
Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..
I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally...
Where were you?
Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.
Not really.
Uh huh.
I 'm in love with you.
Jarvis Oberblau, Cornell.  I mean, the ideas you put forth and, and from someone... so... young... and... .
Wow, it 's like a dirty math problem.
Oh God!
I don 't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!
I wish I didn 't have to go.
Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?
Oh, you're right.
Okay.
Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.
Well then why did you give me a ring?
Give me that.
Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn 't mind.
Ohh! Fish, seaweed, a sunken ship.
You put your fist through the wall?
Oh she was looking for you.
Uh-hmm.
Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.
Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you 're not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!
Alright. Thats it!  <Pushes Amy back>
Yes you did! What was it?
Aces!
Monica Gellerrr.
Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is,  "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her?  Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?!
Let's not do that any more.
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those
Yeah!
Because Purvry Perverson over here can 't stop staring at her.
Yeah, he thinks that 's my name.
Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!
You guys, you 're never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole!  Look kinda familiar?
Why?
Here, let me.  Rachel Green's line, how may I help you?
Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now.
Bite me?
What? What? Ross, you're scaring me. What's going on?
Stop sending food to our apartment.
Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
It's so amazing I met you the same day that Eric broke up with me, because it's like you lose a boyfriend,
You 're still going to that chiropractor, that man couldn't get into medical school in Extapa!
I - I have to get on the plane.
So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?
It's not.
Yesss?
Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff.
Hornswoggle?  Ooh, this must be killing you.
She picked those out too.
I paid for those tickets!
"Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm already there when your playing this message?"  Is that too spooky?
Yeah.
What a baby.
No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'.
It 's not the pants. It's you that is backwards. And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all!
A dinosaur died a million years ago?
Hey!
What was the book?
You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!
Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.
I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing.
Hey.
Okay, here we go.

Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?
Oh, I 'm sorry. Ross Tillman.
Joey was in a porno movie.
Okay, the old hug and roll.
Mommy, I can't find Waldo.
Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
Hey!
What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.
Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we 're going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor 's dog walker?!
I 'm sorry, I can't!
Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.
Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens, happens. Destiny.
C'mere, Patti.
Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?
Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank.
It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.
Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua 's gone so you and Emily are free to go.
For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport.
I know. I know. I 've feeling
Well yeah!!
Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.
Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her?   Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?
Hello?  Oh, it's our nanny!  Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye!   That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?
And you 're so sweet.  And you're kind
Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?
Yeah.
Very bad!
Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight?
I see.
Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!
I have a little comb.
Yeah.
I was not!
Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister 's mouth long enough to tell me that.
I 've got a science question.
Oh hello, Ross.
You see, that 's why I did so bad on this test. I'm having a hard time concentrating. When you're up there  and you're teaching and your face gets all serious you look so good.  You wear that tight little turtleneck sweater
Oh no. No Ross, don 't do this.
There's this woman, that I like.  A lot.  Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy.  For a long time.  And I could never do that to the guy, y'know?  'Ccause we're really good friends.
Oh, come on Ross...
Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
You 're a big scrud.
Hi! You 're back from your date!
Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!
Well, I, I should go in there.
What's that?
Ahh!
It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?
Okay, but try and get Joey too.
Uh-huh.
No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting.
Hi... I'm Sandy.
She's supposed to be with you.
Oh... Oh boy...  Hi...
Ross, you stay here and talk, I 'm gonna go have a baby.
Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
Listen to me!!
Macadamia nut?
Ross! Phoebe 's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!
Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!
Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?
Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way.
We have heard you play.
Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here.  What are you doing?
That'd be good.
...and live forever as a machine!
Duh-huh!
There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
This is so cool,  'til Monica gets back, it's like I'm head chef and I get to make all the decisions.
Well, why didn 't you just take a cab?
Please, don 't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
So are you gonna tell him?
Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.
Well you 're not selling the story! It's like; it's like you don't believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when I'm preparing for an audition. Okay? I'll set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what you're doing wrong.
Okay.
Well isn 't it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?
Who?
Go.
Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she 's talking about! I am an excellent driver!
Wait a minute, I can 't give this to her.
Whad'ya mean no?
Hey!!
She didn 't pass.
Um, there was a Geller Cup?
Oh, that is amazing!
Here, let me try.
What? Who?
Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.
Oh we were, but that was just a , I mean that was just a big drunken mistake.
Hey guys! Hey!
Two, two babies?
What if she jumped out the bassinet?
Ohh, absolutely.
Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
Making out in your office.
Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.
All right, Ross!
Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
So what's it gonna be?
Anyway, I've decided to offer you the grant.
Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner.
Oh! Oh my God oh! Oh my God she 's here.
Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.
No, only for sex.
Excuse me, I don 't want Greg and Jenny's rejects.
Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and it bent.
Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?
Oh, she does want to.
Oh, I got that for him.
Shake it off.
Oh, please, miss, you don't understand!
That 's a good story, Grandpa.
Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.
Uhh, 11!
Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?
I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.
Hey.
You told on us?
Da Da.
Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck, Emma!
Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.
Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus , we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.
Honey, honey, I 'm sorry, I know it's our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don't have time to stop.
Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There 's some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa.  Hey sisters!   Wow, we really are bitches.
I love you too!
Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
Monica 's wasted.
Phoebe 's a porn star!
Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
Hi.
I 'll be right back.
Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too?
Sixty guests.
God, Susan is so fun!
We are going to Dick Clark 's New Year's Rocking Eve!
Yeah?
That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.
Okay, see now, what I just heard
Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register.
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
What?
Oh nothing I Sorry, I just can 't stop crying.
Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?
Bye.
Well it 's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.
Not me.
Weekend at Bernie 's.
Hey.
Chandler M. Bing?
I'm sorry, but I can't say.
Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!
Oh, I don 't know, I guess, Chris O'Donnel, John F. Kennedy, Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson.
Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?
Yeah.
Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...
Okay.
But Rachel has an apartment.
Oh... okay, just hide!
One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis... WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've not finished counting!!
Hi! How are you?
Hey.
Hi.
Hey.
What?! I just touched him and he went over.
Yeah I guess you're right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks.
Oh my God!
Well it stupid, unfair question!
They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat?
No, it 's really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.
I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
Hi, Ross.
Yeah!
Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!
Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you 're gonna have the baby and I don't want to lose again!
All right, let 's go!
Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?
Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he 's wrong.
No, none at all. You need to be happy with whoever is in your home... Although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem? Maybe it's something I can work on in the future.
Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.
Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he 's 'Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!'
Okay Ross come on let 's just forget about the condoms.
Ooh, actually I 've been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!
Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
I see him, you guys are just the worst hiders ever.
No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
Very good.
You're going to China?
Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I 'll have you fired. What you heard was, "Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!"
Ross, are you there? Ross, I don 't know if you can hear this but  I'm gonna talk anyway, uh, I'm in the States with you sister and your friends and it's all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you-Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you.
Oh honey, this is for the best, thus I'm not distracted, worrying about Emma, how she's doing at home and I'm being completely here with you and, oh, she spit up!
Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
I see.
Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?
Yeah, but that was different. Y 'know? I mean, we were, we were going out then, now I think it's weird.
No!
Ok, careful.
Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!
How do you know about that?
Hey Ross!
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?
What I said was, was that I understood. Joey 's the one who agreed with you!
Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
How could it not matter?!
Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink,  'cause I'm heading up there.
Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What's wrong with us? You know when people hear about our situation they
All right, I 'm off to see your dad.
Well, I-I-I 've been on Standby for a flight home for hours.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
Okay, go ahead.
Oh!
Hi.
' I am Bea. '
Hi!
Yeah.  Why aren 't you with Rachel?
That 's right.
What?
How long since you 've seen a girl naked?
Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright.
Uh, four.
Well, you 're-you're sweating.
Hey!
You do?
Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!
What about AndrÃÃ©?
Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!
This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish.
well you not what you should feel terrible about, this could have been my serious guy he was sweet and smart and funny. Do you know how hard it is to meet a guy like that?
Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?
Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!
Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!
Listen, we both know you 're gonna do it 'cause you're not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.
Oh!
Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...
That's fair... Although, can I ask... why do you think that is?
Easy tiger.
Monica.
Got it!
Thank you for a delightful stay.
Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave?  Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!
Really?!
What are you guys doing out here?
We 're so sorry.
See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?
Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
So, I got the results of the amnio today.
So I guess Rachel had you baby?
I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls at the party, GOD!
Ok... "Emma just said gleba"!
It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy.
I didn't know that.
Really?!
So fellas

"...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody.."
Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they don 't even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!
I know what you're thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny!
No! You don 't want to wreck it, you don't want to go to fast!
Shhhh!
Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.
Hey!
Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?
Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.
Are you okay?
Aw what are you?! A detective?
Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room?  Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already?  Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons.
Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
Hey, so how is it?
We 're not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children and I still do, so that's why we're just gonna be friends.
New York.
I got glasses!
So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I 'm just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.
Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.
Yeah -Ooh! Earrings!
huh.  What's the difference between beer and lager?
Yeah, but it-it-it 's my whole life-you come to England.
You are gonna be fine, believe me.
No, come on, I'm totally ok.  I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own.
I guess I didn 't really think about it.
Mmm-mm.
Yeah, so?
I mean maybe you didn 't hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?
Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.
Hi! How 'd it go?
Hi Ben!
No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.
Really?
Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl.
Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?
Gert!
Let me get you some coffee.
Thank God.
So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me.
I know I should 've.  "I'm sorry."
That sounds fair.
Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems like yesterday they just got engaged.
You gotta hear this, it's great... It's like free porn!
Hey, Ross, Bodington's!
Well, I guess that's all in the past, now.
You're hurt!
