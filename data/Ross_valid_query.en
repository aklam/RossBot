You can 't ask us son, that's cheating.
I just can 't decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?
Look, I don't see why I should have to miss out on the coaching training just because I'm a woman.
Hurry!
That is neither here nor there.
I love your place! Where is this guy from?
Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.
No, it 's all right. I got nice boobs.
Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.
I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.
Then, I 'd steer clear of Phoebe.
You got another ex-wife back there?
Do you mind telling us what it is?
Hey.
Yeah, sounds like a good idea... Dr. Geller!
Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!
Oh, man, I'm sorry. Why?
You have a son!
We love you. Buy.
Well those are very popular frames.
Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.
No, but he did just win the McArthur genius grant.
That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight.  Maybe there's something in that area.
It 's been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.
Oh, make it stop!
I 'm Andrew, and I didn't pay for this pear.
We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two?
Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.
I'll do it.
and all those dinosaur nick-knacks you have Ross, I thought they might be more at home in the garage.
Yeah.
Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn 't you date him?
A-alright! I can do this.
But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too.
Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.
It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keep focusing on Jordie.
...It's kinda hard though!
Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat!
Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
Looks like it.
What's a matter with you?
Can we come in?
Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
Thank you Rachel.
They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds.
Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
Y'know what you should do?
yea you know you are a bit of a drama queen.
Close your accounts? Is there some kind of problem?
For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!
No! Listen, I 'm not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can't blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let's just call this, tie score and it's halftime.
Hey!
I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.
Your folks are really that bad, huh?
Yeah, I just don't buy it.
Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?
Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown. I thought you guys might like to come.
No that 's just--That's just 'cause I'm such a good messer!
Tommy 's supposed to be here soon, we're going to lunch.
Yeah. I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say,  I am really enjoying Nacho Chair.
Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That 's what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top.  Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
Services?  Oh, services.
nothing, I'm excited about our date, Mike this is Ross Geller this is Mike Haaaaa
I can 't!
Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can...
Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!
You guys, can we please not watch this all right.
Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don 't
Oh no, no, right I shouldn 't have said married. Uh, please don't go freaky on me. I didn't mean it. Well, I didn't say it; I take it back!
Both of you together?
Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?
Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!
Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!
Shut up.
Yeah.
That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice.
Hey! So what show are you on?
You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.
Ohh, I would love too.
Do you wanna get to Rachel in time?
Oh my God, I gotta go to work!

Okay... aahhh... Please laugh for mommy... Please? Please laugh for mommy...  Not funny huh? Oh so, is it... only offensive novelty rap? Or maybe just, you know, rap in general? 'Cause mommy can rap...  My name is mommy and I'm here to say / that all the babies are... Oh, I can't rap... Allright sweetheart... This is only because I love you so much, and I know that you're not gonna tell anybody...  I like... big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... / when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face...  Yes! Yes! Yes! YES! Oohhhhh! Oh!  I like big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... Oh Emma you're laughing! Oh you are, you really do like big butts, don't you. Oh you beautiful little weirdo...
Yeah, okay but look, buy uh -Hey-hey, y'know, y'know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn't get said enough. I like you Ross.
Oh, it 's a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven't done the secret thing in a long time.
We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old...
Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it 's not!
Not knowing when to shut up...
Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up .
She 's right! You have to stop!
Yes it does.
I said it first, bro.
Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.
Thank you.
Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle?
There you go.
Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air.  Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone
So, er... how did it go with Celia?
Oh right, because you 're so capable of change.
Yes!
Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.
Bye!
What?!
Yeah!   Are you kiddin'?
You make me laugh.
Nice to see you.
has your girlfriend got the butt?
Hey, what 's the horsepower on this thing?
Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!
Gimme an  'I!'
That was you?
So who else was in this club?
That is so sweet, you guys.
Ross, I thought you were over this.
Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?
Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.
Why not?
Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least one of your weddings . See now, tonight, all I
I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.
Ross, it just wouldn 't have been feasible.
Center ice.
Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
Ross, you don't seem okay.
Oh, well I tell Issac everything.
Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here.
Hi!
Yeah. The  '92 Ross wouldn't.
Yeah, it would be really weird.
I know!
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
Well neither do I!
You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
So what does this mean?
Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I 'm gonna break up with you!
Wow, what?
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
I love Mark.  Do you know Mark?
Okay, umm, I 'm gonna get my sweater.
Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.
Well, she 's out of town so, there's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
I 'm sorry!
Alright, now you say something.
Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can 't just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You're gonna get peep eye!
I just saw Janice.
What?! Are you crazy?
Right. Was it the,  "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"
Yeah, me neither. Yet
Oh my God!
After a while it's like, shut your mouth, you know?
Um-hum, you're jealous.
Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
Look at that!
Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
Do you want any help?
So, what do you think?
"When can you move in?"
Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it 's against my oath as a masseuse.
What, the blonde with no bra?
Cute.
No, absolutely. Y 'know like it was umm
I can 't believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is this crumb.  I wish you a long and happy marriage.
I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
Thanks.
Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.
Petty...
I 'm not trying to pull anything. Look I love you dude.
So, let's go.
Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.
I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.
Oh my!
Uh why, do you have a lecture?
Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?
Welcome to the building. I'm uh, Steve Sarah; I'm president of the tenants committee.
Shall we?
I know I do.
Alright, what are we gonna say?
Wait a minute, why don 't you just call Mark.  I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen.
Come on! you...
Ah yeah, but now it 's Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home.
And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century.
And, a lemon lime.
You think?!
Uhh, I can 't.
hey wait wait wait wait wait! Is that true what you said Phoebe's never had a serious relationship?
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn 't, and if you have to even think about it...
Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Why is he still crying?
Come on. I want to know.
Christmas.
You or me?
Your hands are shaking.
Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
I 'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
You have a son?
Professor Geller!
Well, I have a PhD, so...
Oh, that is so...
I do love you.
Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep.
How does going to a strip club help him better?
Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!
Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?
Hey!
But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.
Oh yeah? Well thanks.
That's perfect! That's brilliant!
No.
Wow you, you. I had no idea.
Very, very bad.
All right, y 'know what? We really are late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!!
M-m.
How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you slept together last night.
Can I ask you something?
All right.
I 'm gonna leave the three of you alone.
Oh, blimey, I still can 't believe you've got an earring!
Wait, no, look at this!    "Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay " Oh, yeah, but it's on the ground floor.
But Ross, its you and me!
Yes!
I 've got Ben.
You got sprayed with two two' s and...
What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
It 's so cool man, it's so, it's just 'cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.
That 's not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don't feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
Okay, you wore me down.
Okay.  Did ah, you guys mean you plus one?
Oh, me too.
No, I'm not talking about you.  <to Rachel> It was your fat
Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol 's great and I'm sure you're a very attractive man, but I .
Oh.. a little..
So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
Hit me.
He could be in disguise, y 'know.
Why?  'Cause otherwise you'd go for it?
All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.
Yes we are. So, coffee?
Oh, I 'm Ross. I'm Ross. I'm too good for the Hut; I'm too good for the Hut.
What about you honey, who would be on your list?
Okay. Okay!
Hey, kids...
Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.
They 're gonna fire you! You can't date a student! It's against the rules.
Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.
Really?
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay, I know. Hold on.  Hey Ross?
But you two were supposed to be together.
Oh, put him on!
Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one.
Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
Think I better go before mommy starts weeping.
NO, no science camp!
Big fat goalie.
Ooh...
Yeah, just give me a minute!  Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.
What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
I 'm sorry?
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
You can really arrange that?
Look, either help me or go.
Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?
I came with Paul!
Okay, one question.
So it would just be, me alone?
Or, y 'know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you've got y'know a little of this  goin' on. Wow! I still have it!
Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little...
That's 'cause you have it.
No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special.
All right...
Oh, I'm sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before.
Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?
Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more.
Ok, how about this ?
Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross!
What?
Yeah, it 's just something I picked up.
Oh my God, you are so paranoid!
Did she leave a number?
I think we 'd better start again. Ross, repeat after me. I, Ross
Oh come -look, when I was a kid my dad's company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn 't in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!
Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's?
Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
Well yeah, but then
Oh my How much do you weigh Ross?!
What?! Oh my...  Oh my God!! What happened?!
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we 'll be supportive like crazy.
So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?
Oh, ok. I'm just always afraid that people think I'm just fat with big breasts.
Oh my God! What did you say?
Ross, he's got the remote again.
I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.
Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel? You know, we're gonna be all like "oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the cape" and you're gonna be all like "oh, I can't guys, I'll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai"
Tails!
Ross, how about you. What would you give up, sex or food?
Ohh, ohh.
No! You don 't know the system! There'll be nobody messing with the system!
What? What? He 's interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here.
Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.
You got it.
Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends.
From the guy in the bar, why didn't I get that message?
Oh I can't... I have seminars all day and I promised Ross I would look at his speech.
Okay, see now I 'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.
Yes.  Yes!
But what?! You figured you 'd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel!
Yeah. Hate him.
Oh, is that against the rules?
I think it's sexy.
She 's perfect.
Howard's the handy man!
All right, relax. It 's just a shoe.
Oh wait I forgot my wrap.
Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you 've grown. Y'know?
Uh-huh.
You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!
You could say that.
When you were in China.
Hi Ross.
Oh my God.
Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?
Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?
Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose.
Oh y 'know, I didn't think of it that way. You're right. You're right. So, can I ask you a question?
Yeah!
I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
Well, it 's not a part, no. I'm teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.
Hey!
What are you mad at me for?!
Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened.
I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks!
Anything but stew.
No, not if their room has two beds!
Here 's Frannie. Hmm, won't she be happy to see me?
Oh no. I feel it isn 't really anybody's business, y'know.
Hey guys!
Yeah!
Oh hi!
Hey!
Yeah.
You said...
Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?
Hey!
Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it 'll still be broken then.
Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean he is a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick!
Oh yeah! I've come up with a bunch of ideas!
Used to work with her. Used to! I 'm a relative and I didn't get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!
Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
I am so glad that you could come over tonight.
Could I be more sorry.
So Santa's coming?
Hey.
I know.
Guess who?
...teen!
Joan?
C'mon touch it.
You were supposed to duck!!! Why didn 't you duck?
Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
That is seven days!
You don 't secretly smoke do you?
Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
I screwed up so bad, I told Monica that I would stuff and send all these wedding invitations like weeks ago and I-I
Good. You?
Okay, well that's now the third sign that I should not leave Emma.
It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.
It was really... great!
Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they 're gonna be, be drinkin' and dancin, and we really wanna go!
Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because -I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me-not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right.   Your decision.
The sky 's blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!
Can you believe they're still not here?
Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.
Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
That 's okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It's not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there's gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?
Yeah, that makes sense.
What? You 're leaving?!
She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.
Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair!  And it was uneven for weeks!
Well, you got here just in time. I really have to go buddy.
No, answer his.
Yeah, I'm with Mon.
Hey!
...little playthings with yarn?
Care to venture a guess?
Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
Ross!
Ahhhh.
Okay ladies, that ends today 's class, and let's remember, let's be safe out there.
Ohh, ohh.
That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say.
You pushed him!
Weekend at Bernie's.
I don 't see it!
Hi! Bye!
Yeah... for three years.
Get the hell out of there, y 'know?
Hey!
Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one time -not any more. I just-I...
And um, excuse me, he helps me.
Ah?  Do you have one here?
Why the hell didn't you tell me!
Oh.
Menstrual cramps.
What?
Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.
Well Ross, you be careful now. You don 't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents.
Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs.
I'm sorry, that's not funny.
He 's sleeping.
Are you serious?
I know what this is all about... You've always been
Oh, that's great, that is great!
Come on, he's still in the bathroom! I'm begging you!
Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!
I uhm... I completely understand.
It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.
Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this.
Actually, I should get going.
What?
So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
Oh... How are they?
I think its Tibidabo.
Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time.
No! Forget her, man! You don 't need her, you don't need that!
Wow, that 's in like 20 minutes. You'd better get dressed.
Ok, go quick!
I got it.
You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!
She 's gonna be fine. Okay, she's in a more difficult position so you're gonna have to push even harder now. Go! Push!
Okay.
Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.
What is with you tonight?
Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world 's worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!
That 's what I was gonna say.
Huh ha ha!
Hi
Ooh! Oh!
Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!
Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let 's face it, so far the guy's not lovin' ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner, y'know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer!
but you did say it
Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!
Hop in.  Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
I'm gonna get the lasagna.
Hey, I went by the photo shop, take a look, here is a mockup of our card. What do you think?
Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.
What?
I'll take this one too  Uh ... Mommy?
You didn 't propose to me. Joey did.
Yeah, I 'm all in love with you and stuff. So could you change my grade?
Yeah.
Thanks.
We should get over there and see if she's okay.  Just one...second! Score!  Game! Come on.
Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
Well, if you don't know I can't help you.
You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!
Well, hey! Well...  Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and...  I wanna say Mike?  To Phoebe and Mike!
Hey.  Ross, I know you're pissed at me, but we have to talk about this.

Oh my God.
Let go!
Could you guys help me?
Ohh, Ross, please!
Come on, you guys are more then that! I mean, you 're gonna get together right?
Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?
And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know,
He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.
Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.
And you 're Okay with that?
Well, I took it.
Look, we have enough, just walk away.
Ok.
No! He blew us off!
You don 't?!
Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn 't. I mean if she just died this morning out of respect.
So.
Really?
Oh it 's all right. I'm guess I'm just done with the whole dating thing. It's one more thing in my life that's suddenly completely different. This is hard.
Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.
Well I mean, you 're American to start with. You don't even have rugby here.
You're doing great, you're doing fine.
There was a woman at the...  The stripper?!
Ohh, I 'm sorry I couldn't think of anymore for Ross!
Eh, why don't we start with the beer?
You could say
Well actually they 're taping tomorrow. I don't really understand why.
Ross!
I know. I know, but y 'know condoms only work like 97% of the time.
Wait, now so you joined the gym?
You guys, what was the Powerball number again?
No, I let him win -Ross!
Yeah, yeah I like him a lot.
And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant.
It's OK, it's fine.
Do the claws again.
No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.
Yay!
Ross, hi. It's me. I just got back on the plane. And I just feel awful. That is so not how I wanted things to end with us. It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you, and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... And... And now I'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have said, and I didn't. I mean, I didn't even get to tell you that I love you too. Because of course I do. I love you. I love you. I love you. What am I doing? I love you! Oh, I've gotta see you. I've gotta get off this plane.
Awe!  Oh my God! Looks, she 's a little dare-devil! Oh, let me push, can I push?
Oh!
Look at this.
G'bye, everybody.
My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle.
What did you just do?
Why did you change it, Ella was so much prettier!
No, you have it, really, I don't want it-
Oh I wanted to.
See you guys.
Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.
Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.
Forget about it. It's no big deal.
You are asking me to be your wife!
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
And you know what? We want a rematch.
No one wanted seconds, right?
Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash!
Ross, say something. Anything.
Ha-ha!
Oh, Bob, get off the guy!
Oh no! Why not?
Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he 'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
He forgot to leave his grip size!
Wow!
No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.
Action!
You're shooting with Althea?!
What?
With another woman. Have you no control Ross?
Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?
If we broke up, and I lost you...
Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...
Always.
I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say  "get out of my office!"
Huh?
I think you know.
I 'm Scott.
You're okay there?
All right are you guys gonna come down?
Hey, what kind of puppy do you think I should get?
I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I-
Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.
Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
I 'm telling you it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, that's all.
What 's going on?
Chandler 's making his sex face.
Oh no! Why?
Have to make it stop!!
During this time are you, are you still my best man?
Oh, scotch neat. Ya know, that's Rachel's father's drink.
You went out with her?! We had a pact!
Good for you. Alrighty, next?
Ohh, brisk tonight.
Why don 't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first  weighing stuff.
Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we 'd do nothing.
Actually, it makes us feel that big.
Hey Ross! The baby 's kicking!
But you were going to propose?
Oh my God! What are you doing here?
Stupid balls are in the way.
An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn 't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty- fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
I can 't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
We can 't tell him, you can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.
Hi!
Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.
And that 's why, I'm not inviting you in for a drink.  Bye.
I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything.
You 're thing. You're thing. Y'know? You're the guy who gets divorced.
She is gonna hate me.
Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.
Maybe.
Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?
Hold on.  Fill these out, sit over there.
No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please, come on we do not have any of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not have a diaper service!
Cheers!
Why'd you freak out?
Oh come on!
And Ross, if it weren 't for Rachel's rumor I mean no one in high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!
I 've got some bad news.
No one.
What?! What honey?
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
So are you gonna...talk to her?
Can't we just ask her to go?
Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?
Great!
What?!
Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
Oh, I think I see the problem. And I 'm afraid we're gonna have to use a much stronger tool.  Love.
Was that the cake?
Actually, Alby is the guy I broke up with.
Tramp?!
Like a log.
Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!
Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.
Oh, I've got big Valentine's plans! I've got my Chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!
Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I 'd better go.
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!
Art lover!
Look!
Say something..... hot.
All right, we 've got to tell her he's gone.
I just had the hardest day. Those bags are so heavy.
Ow!
I know no, no, y'know you don 't deserve this, you don't Ross. You're, you're really, you're so good.
Eh, I 'm just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I don't want to get back together over a machine.
I never should have broken up with you. I think about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?
Okay.
You're welcome. And thank you for "Science Boy". I learned a lot from him
I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
Dysprosium.
Oh-oh, you lie.
Your kid is seven?!   He's really small.  Please! Please get the tickets!
I 'm sorry! It was a reflex!
Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help.
I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!
Yeah, well he 's my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
Okay...  ..whose turn is it?
Hey. Oh, I 'm sorry, this is Cailin.
Ohh, no. Ugh. Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there.
The actress!
Ohh! Oh my God!
Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making. Listen.
That is.
Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.
Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!
I like it.
Hello.
Alright, I got it Ross.
Diapers huh?
Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
Oh! Oh! The usher must be right! What, with all that training they go through! Get out!!  Here!   Hey man, you want the aisle?
No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.
She asked-asked you out again?
Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
None for me.
Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing.  Uh, lie back..
Aww, look at the little thing.
Damn it!
Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don 't we Ben?
Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!
Blow it.
So what.
You do?
Hiccups.

Oh!
Wait! No! No! It's my hamster! It's Mitzi!
No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?
Congratulations! You just got married!
Mississippi? I said count to five'!
Hey Toby! Have a good night.
Hey thanks.
What?! Ross y'know this isn 't even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?
They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.
Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.
Yeah, it 's the new building on Avenue A.
Thanks!
It 's your mommy. It's your mommy.
Y 'know what else makes you wonder?
No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.
Yeah, and y 'know what? I love them both, so why don't you just pick one and that'll be it.
Ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs?
Really? Did you count Mississipily?
I know.
Sorry-
You are so fired.
I'm so sorry...
Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing.
That 's a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three days!
So.... I quit.
Great!
I know! I know, she says it 's all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff.  So come on, she's gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?
I can still see you!
Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it 's time the velvet ropes came down.
So why did you plan a party at the same time?
Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to say, and some of it didn't even make any sense.
Yeah! Right! Okay, I 'll see you guys later.  Woo hoo!
Okay, well, we brought you some wine.
Susan and I live together.
I mean, that's a typical guy response.
Okay. Okay, here 's a good one of us.
Hey!
I didn 't do it! It was Chandler! He's He's mad at you!
What?!
I am those things, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
Oh shout, that would have been fun.
No, hit me
Thanks.
No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there 's other stuff. Here's a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...
Hey! Ready to go?
So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame!  What the hell's going on over here?!?!?  Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.
My parents are going to be really mad.
Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel!
Why? Why do I have to learn?
Who? Me the attacker?
Ross.
Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It 's uh-Wait!  Did you write this?
You burn your mouth?
Okay, all right, give me the mug! I 'll keep the mug.
I 'll go.
Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really know me that well; it would be weird.
No, I mean it's not Geller.
Deal!
Nobody likes change.
You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.
I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
Ross.
I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
We 're not gonna do this, all right? She's just gonna think that we're doin' it.
I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, I 'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.
Huh?
You remember not having sex in high school, right?
Let 's have Monica decide.
Okay. Y 'know what? I'd have to say I really don't care for your tone. And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem to-Whoa!  Oh gosh! Whoa!
Hey!
Ah!
Was it like a sneeze only better?
All right.
Hey...
OK, Ross, listen to me, I am not yours to save.
Six months? Whoa that 's rough.
Yes, it 's a highly controversial procedure.
Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea.
Dr. Oberman.
What?
Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
I never had a bike of my own.
Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die  <knocks on table>  she'd have to give her up.
oh it's just you have that look
Oh no-no-no, you don 't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
I 'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren't that great either.
Ross!
Hey!
Oh!  Wow!
Yeah.
Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?
Why?
In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
I got that!
Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here.  Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!
Wow
All right, I 'll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that's it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds.  Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?
"Look, this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok?"  "Oh, thank you very much!"  Yeah, I'm going to Vermont...
Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are you doing here?
Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!
Did I miss it, did I miss it?
Okay that 's fair.
No.
Could you want her more?
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.
Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
No, come on, you know that's not true.
If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact  'Homo-sapien', is that why there extinct?
IF you hold a spider.
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
Come on Ross. We 're sorry. Please tell us what it is.
Oh good.
Geller!
Wha... the next one?
You're not the only one who has a date tonight.
Oh!
Y 'know, like where are we? Where is this relationship going?
Oh-A.
It 's possible. You are very loveable, I'd miss you if I broke up with you.  I was just trying to be supportive.
Hi, good morning lover. I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees.
Ross I 'm so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.
Marlon-
Come on, please?! I 'm boredddd! You let me do it once before.
HEY! Mike called were going out again! YAY! YAY!
I know.
What are you doin'?
Oh no!
What?
Are you okay?
Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don 't let her go without a fight!
I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.
Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I haven't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one.
But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
Hi.. how was the game?
Okay.
Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .
Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money.
Oh, wow, Molly is just great!
Oh hi, I 'm, I'm Mona from her restaurant.
Umm, do you see any -oh, Vaseline?
Hit me! Hit me!
So he likes to break stuff.
Oh, was it awful?
Dance karate?
You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?
That means a lot to me man.
You 're right. I mean I'm sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you!
Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?
She is now.
Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have- Emma scared... But this is... fine. This is gonna be good.
Sure, I'll just get my coat.  Could you get that?
I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch.
Maybe he 's just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
Ross?
Hey!
Let's do it, come on!
This isn 't mine.  Hey, this isn't, this isn't my stuff! Ugh, Ross!  These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
And I will see you tomorrow!
Change of plans, I made you a special Valentine's dinner! Surprise!
I can't believe she can out run you man!
All right, that 's it! He cannot do this to Phoebe.  This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime!  But, is he a big guy?
Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica 's and she and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.
All right, I'm nine years old.
Well, does that mean that you 're not going to wearing yours?
You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody 's work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!
They 're having their baby! It's not fair Ross we got here first! Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery. Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.
I'll be right back.
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
What?
Will you marry me?
In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it.
Oh great, the pacifiers?
Dude, step up! I proposed.
That's it.
Thank you soo much for coming on such a short notice. Ladies and gentlemen, I've-I've-I've been practicing medicine for twenty-three years, and I'm stumped.
Well, the white seems to be untouched.  Uh-oh.
Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You've got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven't you ever been unemployed?
Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.
What?!
Doctor Ross Geller.
Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.
Oh, you're gonna be great!
No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.
And we 'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
How are you doing?
Well, because if one more person says "what a cute little boy" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna!
So how come it took you so long to ask me out?
Ooh... Dr. Geller!
Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter.
There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?
Hey, the fight 's starting!
What are you playing with?
Not gonna find any clothes in there!
Oh, it 's my fault?! You didn 't have to massage him! You could've sent him away! You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!
I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!
YOU! You feel!
All right, all right.
Yeah, and there won 't be a relationship left to rebuild.
All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to Athens should now be on board.
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
What, what, what?
Oh my god you're right.
I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.
Come on see, she doesn 't look that bad.
Well, we could do that!
Your first marriage?
No, nine.
I was the pile of coats!
How 's it gonna be all right?!
I am Guru Saj.
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
Hey, who's this little naked guy?
OK, you know what, are, are you being like, the blind date guy again?
Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights!  Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away!  Oh, see you just need to find the right command.
Why is 10 the highest?
Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!
No, but you know what I mean.
Yeah, we were we were just looking around.
Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
Well, it doesn 't sound like it! I mean, it's pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don't kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!
Hi!
Hey!
Yeah, sure?
Hey, let's go look at it!
It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.
All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!
Bye, fat ass.
Yeah, I want my tickets too ! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!
Yeah, but it 's not a big deal.
Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!
Uh-huh.
Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?
Well, I 'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done.
Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y 'know you-I couldn't concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what's it's like to be 19 and in love.
Yeah. It's gonna be weird.
I know.
Oh, just, y'know.... science.
Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?
No, there isn't time to go to the bakery. We're just gonna come home... Everybody left? Alright, well just tell Emma we're gonna be there as soon as we can.  Bye...
Then get over yourself! Grow up!
What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....
Hey! You made it!
Hi.
Really Mr. Geller, you don 't have to do this.
You won 't let go?
Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
Yes, I do.
Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
What 's funny about that?
Let me get my coat.
Bwah-hah-hah!
Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!
Oh that 's right!
Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks!
Did you not hear me say,  "Du-ude?!"
Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. If she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go.
Where are you going?
Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
You don't wanna win the lottery?
Exactly.
Y'know what, I can handle it, handle 's my middle name. Actually it's the ah, middle part of my first name.
I mean, we know it 's a bit hasty but, uh, it just feels so right, so
Yeah.  Nice try!
How's it going with her?
Oh.
Oh that 's not so bad.
Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year.
Take care.
Oh!
Oh hey Ross oh I'm so glad someone's here could you zip me up?
Ross, would you just stop it! It 's getting really old.
Ohh, honey no problem. Okay.
Me too!
All right.
Alright, look, I'll start, OK?
That was a good day!
Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.
Nothing, I just like to go like this.
Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said
Sorry.
Yeah, by Sandrine.
Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes.
If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
No, I think that was the whole all.
Somebody lose a ring?
So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
We have a half hour.
I was sending you signals?
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction
Oh, hello liar.
Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently people now call you mental.
Oh that 's great!
Hello, Ross?
Ross, we can solve this. I just heard your speech. We can recreate it! We've got all night!
No, when you put your feet up in my bed, you tugged on my catheter.
We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it 's actually for Joshua.  Look, he said he's not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him!
You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!
What!? You faked it?
Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.
Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can 't talk to Rachel.
Keep singing! Keep singing!
Ross, we can handle this.
Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, "hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck".
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or , or I'm the one who dates her.
Yeah, sure.
You didn 't find her?
Oh yeah?

Bad dream?
Whoa whoa whoa! Where 're you goin'?
Well Joey doesn 't like to talk about it but, he's one of the stars of Days Of Our Lives.
You sat back and let him have her, you didn 't fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
Ross?
Are you crazy?!
Grazie.
Fine, just stop thinking about me.
Hey!
Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.
Hey!
Yeah.
Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person... When I left, I said
Fears and Pet Peeves.
Ohh that 's so sweet!
Maybe I'll just turn the lights down a little.
Come on!
You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!
Oh, just look at her...
It's my TV.
Oh, no-no, y 'know I absolutely adore Rachel it's just that, well it might be a awkward for you. But it's absolutely your decision.  More tea?
You wanna see her again, right?
