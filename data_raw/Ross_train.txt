Yeah. <+++++> I can 't, I can't even believe her! No, y'know what, I am, I am gonna go!
It's a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back to your apartment? <+++++> All right.  'Candy and Cookie?'
What? <+++++> I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
How late are we? <+++++> Forty-five minutes.
Namaste. <+++++> Namaste.
Ross of..... <+++++> Of Ross and Rachel.
Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more! <+++++> What are you, a child?
I don't know... <+++++> One more fight!
Too? <+++++> Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.
No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not worth it. <+++++> Well, but, but. . .
Y'know I can 't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!! <+++++> FINE BY ME!!
I think so. <+++++> Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.
Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer! <+++++> Ah!  Well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, y 'know give it a test ride.
Dead leg!! <+++++> Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.
Oops sorry, my mistake. <+++++> Dear Lord!!
Hey. <+++++> Hey.
Hey. <+++++> You guys know where Rachel is?
That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here! <+++++> Well, you just
But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had. <+++++> Until now.
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while? <+++++> Sure!
No. But I remember people telling me about it. <+++++> I hope Ben has a little sister.
Don 't try to sway her.   I'm your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let's go. <+++++> We 'll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth-me.
Ross? <+++++> I never gave it to you.
That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect. <+++++> No no, that's me.
You know what? I've been thinking about it. I'm really coming around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that. <+++++> Rach, I-I can't tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind? Unless, you know we're never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. You know it's a boy!
I know, I get it, but Mona, what relationship is not complicated? I mean we all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single?  I am so gonna leave right now. <+++++> Should I leave this open for you too?
Okay Ross, why don 't you come with me? <+++++> Okay.   What ah, what is the matter with you? What 's going on?
All right.  Fine. <+++++> Yowzah!!!
Ah, there we go. <+++++> I think we proved our point.
Okay, in about ten seconds you 're gonna see him kiss me. <+++++> And in about five seconds you 're gonna see why.
Oh, yeah, right. There was a break-in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey was taken. <+++++> Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.
Well, he 's not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with him-He says it's okay.  Great! Thanks! Bye-bye! <+++++> Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn 't free?
Phoebe?! Wait a -but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup. <+++++> Ohh, I don 't think so.
Yeah. So, do you want to give a check? Or <+++++> Oh. Uhh
Really? <+++++> Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce.
No, I-I haven 't seen your pink shirt. <+++++> Great! Great. Then I must 've left it at Mona's. I knew it!
PHD <+++++> You're filthy!
Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or Phoebe? <+++++> What?
Like asking her to move in with you? <+++++> Smaller than that.
I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in. <+++++> Really? Did you count Mississipily?
You fell asleep?! <+++++> It was 5
Yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35 th wedding anniversary, I had a star named after them. <+++++> Aww that is so cool.
Alright, you know what? That 's it. You've had your chance. <+++++> Wha-what?
What did I just say? <+++++> Watch.  Here, you ehm... You highlight the word you want to change.
Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel. <+++++> Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?
Hey, Ross!  I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second? <+++++> Sure, go ahead. Whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead.
Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that. <+++++> Really?
Oh that 's all right, I'm coming back later with your father. <+++++> Oh good.
All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you. <+++++> No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
Yes it is! <+++++> Why is it inside out?!
Ooh! That 's good! Wow! But now if you were pregnant, what would you name it? Hint <+++++> Hey! Hi!
I can see the headline now <+++++> Why would I eat my own arm?
"Gimme your money, punk!" <+++++> Oh my god, it was you! I can't believe it, you you mugged me?
So you do know who he is!  Sorry. <+++++> OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys.
Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me? <+++++> You? You! Want to watch Ben?  Yes! That'd be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is.
So, so is she still going to Paris? <+++++> Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not.
We appear to have angered it. <+++++> We?! We angered it?!
owwwww... <+++++> Please don't take her away from me!
We 're at my stop. But would you like to have coffee? <+++++> Are we really in Montreal?!
No, I 'm still going. <+++++> Wh ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ whÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦what?
I have quarters! <+++++> Hey!
Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant.  All right, so I don 't know what sycophant means, but the rest is right. <+++++> Look, I don 't know what you're talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person.
Hey! <+++++> You guys ready to go?
Hey guys! <+++++> Hi Janine!
Ross, can I? <+++++> The head, the head. You gotta...
Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you 're doing frat guys. <+++++> Hey, y 'know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.
No. But that reminds me,  sign this. <+++++> What is it?
Jingle bells, jingle bells... <+++++> Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh  Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Hey, you listen. <+++++> No, no, let me finish.
Why would you serve food on such a sharp stick? <+++++> That 's a good question, dad. That's a good question
What? <+++++> 
Yeah, where were you! <+++++> Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy!
Ross, you've got to do something about the humping. <+++++> What? It's, it's just a phase.
Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y 'know what? I'll-I'll come back later. <+++++> Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I 'll guess just I'll come back.
What happened son? <+++++> I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!
No. <+++++> Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat.
Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him. <+++++> Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?
Thanks. <+++++> Kinda... spooky without any lights.
That 's it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you. <+++++> You 're welcome.
Oh, tell me about it. And she 's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes. <+++++> Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the  "brain transplant," you are going to be her?
So you 've just married the one time then? <+++++> Well umm
Well, thanks for the books. <+++++> No problem, ok, mmmwa  oh, mmmwa  Susan...
I understand... <+++++> No, I'll do it.
Umm, yeah. <+++++> No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....
Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before... <+++++> I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!
Hi! <+++++> Well, how was the date?
What did he say? <+++++> Something about hi.
Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh....  Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun. <+++++> Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.
Son, I had to shave my ears for tonight. You can do this. <+++++> Can you believe that?
Wow, that is tempting. <+++++> Look, she loved her job here. And let's face it
You wanna dance? <+++++> No, that's fine.
Oh... <+++++> Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... with Emma... uhm... We just feel...
What? <+++++> Dad?
He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle. <+++++> This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must take a mental picture!  Ooh sorry
Yeah that 's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about! <+++++> Oh wait -hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
Yeah, I'm her date. <+++++> Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.
You weren't there! <+++++> No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... tzz-zzz, mmm.
Hey, it 's the dinosaur guy.  Hi, Ross. <+++++> Oh, hi Chloe.
Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals. <+++++> Look, I don 't think so Pheebs.  All right, I'll do it. But just because you're a friend.
And the fact that they're both monkeys. <+++++> Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.
What? <+++++> The way he makes me feel about myself.
Any minute now. <+++++> Hey, this-  Heyy...
What? <+++++> I'm having... I'm having a baby.  I'm having a... Where's the phone? The phone?
Almost time for cake. <+++++> Mon, Mon, are you OK?
Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson. <+++++> It was a hug!
That 's so great for you guys! <+++++> Yeah!
What happened in Atlantic City?! <+++++> Well, Chandler and I are in a bar
Yeah, so she went back to Ohio. <+++++> Ohio!! Thank you!
Look at her, my first grandchild. <+++++> What about Ben?
Yay! <+++++> Yay!  Seriously, our sex life I was thinking, maybe I don 't know, we could try some-some new things. Y'know? For fun?
There y'go. Ross? <+++++> Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla! <+++++> I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?
You did a bad thing! <+++++> Yes, I did.
Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something? <+++++> Sure.
No! No. They 're umm They're just uh ground beef smileys. <+++++> Uhh, those are tacos.
I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I- <+++++> Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.
Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I 'm looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up! <+++++> That-that 's always good news. Are you okay?
What about that circled one? <+++++> Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.
I do. <+++++> That's who.
Hey, all right! <+++++> Pretty cool, huh?
Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick! <+++++> Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.
Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex. <+++++> No kidding?
Can I use your phone?  Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please. <+++++> "Heating device."
Right. So, it'll be the same except less sex with you. <+++++> So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?
So how did everything go? <+++++> Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.
Joey he's not even thinking about going after Rachel! <+++++> He 's not?
Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off. <+++++> No!
Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly.  Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men! <+++++> Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.
Noted. <+++++> I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?
Man, this is gonna be kinda weird. <+++++> Yeah, it is.
Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don 't qualify for an annulment. If you two don't want to be together you'll have to file for divorce. <+++++> That 's great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!
Hey, how was class? <+++++> No one ever asked me that, what's wrong?
Y 'know, dirty talk, mÃÂÃÂ©nage ÃÂÃÂ  trois, toys <+++++> Wow!
Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage. <+++++> Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.
No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they? <+++++> Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!
Yeah okay. Well, what 's the next little bit? <+++++> Getting married.  Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that too! Just like you 've done everything else!
Hi! <+++++> Hi!
And after that, what could I do except become a chef. <+++++> Mmm-Hmm.
Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself!? <+++++> No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!
Yeah, and not a very good one. <+++++> Will you-will you please?
I think you 've got concussion. <+++++> No, no, I 'm serious. Thank you.
Ok. If you really need to. <+++++> I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly baked cookies.
She is good! <+++++> Huh, I took a shot there.
Oh, Rachel! <+++++> Actually, um, I was thinking maybe both of us could go.
Hi. <+++++> Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?
Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on!  No! Not in there! He 's in there! <+++++> Did you really hear a bear?
All right, I trust you. <+++++> Rachel, I can see you dialing! I don't understand why...
Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms. <+++++> Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.
Did you not understand the story? <+++++> Hey!
whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH! <+++++> See?
Bye. <+++++> Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?
Yeah! I'll cook! <+++++> Yeah! Let's go out.
Rosssss can! <+++++> Look Phoebe, I 'm sorry it's just
Did Rachel find you? <+++++> No why?
Yeah, if you 're going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area. <+++++> No, us having to lie about being married.
You 're not going to say anything? On our 35th wedding anniversary <+++++> No, of course, Um Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to say on behalf of my new bride, Rachel , and myself. Umm, that if if in 35 years, we're half as happy as you guys are, we'll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.
Y 'know, you look nothing like I would've thought. You're you're so young. <+++++> Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.
Hey you guys! <+++++> Hey!
Some guy, Tom Gordon. <+++++> I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives.
Oh, Ross, you gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalogue. <+++++> Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt.
Uh-huh.  Y 'know what I was, I was thinking about? <+++++> Huh?
Oops! I did not mean to run into you like that sir. <+++++> Oh that is quite all right ma 'am.
Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either. <+++++> Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again.
Now I love you. And not just 'cause I have to. <+++++> Really?
So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma? <+++++> No,  that that is not what we're saying.
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you 're, you're, you're making this too hard. <+++++> Oh I 'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
Hi. <+++++> 
Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much? <+++++> Just a smidge.
Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl? <+++++> Some would say she 's attractive, yes.
That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout,  "I will be revenged?!" <+++++> I will be! Listen, I don 't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
All right. <+++++> All right. Feel good?
Okay fine, what do you have? <+++++> Well, OK, it's for a boy. Well, I know it's a little out there, but Darwin.
You mean the lully story? <+++++> Huh-huh, they already know it.
Oh really? That 's how treat a friend? You get her in trouble and then refuse to marry her? <+++++> Hey! I offered to marry her!
We were out of Doritos. <+++++> Hey, how 'd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?
Dr. Geller? <+++++> I wasn 't farting!  Uh, a little game from our table.  Yes?
Sure. What's up? <+++++> Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk!
Oh please. Okay, anyone in this room think that I would send Ross begging symbols, please show of hands. <+++++> Y 'know what?! It doesn't matter! It doesn't matter what you believe! What matters is what happened!
Radiator. <+++++> Five letters.
Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women? <+++++> Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...
Monica did it? <+++++> Monica?
What 's fish hooking? <+++++> Huh, what 's fish hooking...   Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily!  That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London! <+++++> Really?
So, you feel like a dad yet? <+++++> No, why?
Hi, sweetie! <+++++> Hello.
Does anybody want anything else? <+++++> Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing.  Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money. <+++++> And now you want that money back.
It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad. <+++++> Yeah.
Yeah! <+++++> Are you guys sure about this?
And who may I say is calling? <+++++> This is Ross?
Alright, okay, okay, gleba, gleba...  Gleba! Ha! Here it is <+++++> She's gonna be a scientist!
And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything. <+++++> But also knowing it means a lot.
And yet, she 's still not hanging up the phone. <+++++> Hang it up! Hang up the phone!!
What?! <+++++> No, I mean it 's okay, I mean, they're-they're my friends. In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on. <+++++> Oh my God, what happened?
Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do. <+++++> That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.
Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this. <+++++> Okay, quick and painful.
Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!' <+++++> Ohh. Ouch.
Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked. <+++++> That's so sweet.
Ross, there he is. <+++++> Hey, hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel.
I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils. <+++++> Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings  in his ear.
Just get out! Now!! <+++++> No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
She laughed at you? <+++++> Yeah. I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know. And I just want it to be perfect and right and. . . why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint?
No! <+++++> How come it 's always us left in the field holding the ball?
Oh! I knew it! What happened? <+++++> Umm, she kissed me.
Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning. <+++++> Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
Sure! That would be nice. <+++++> Umm?
And this- is my reward! <+++++> Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
No, everything 's fine. I just gotta go back <+++++> No really, you tell me what 's up.
What were you doing? <+++++> I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
That's what it says here. Flight 421, leaves at 8 <+++++> What?
I remember your first birthday! Ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you. He pulled on his testicles so hard! We had to take him to the emergency room! <+++++> There's something you didn't know about your dad!
Woah, dude, burn. <+++++> I don't get it, he seemed so happy to see me yesterday.
Yeah! <+++++> 3! 2! 1! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!
So!   How 's the library? <+++++> Ugh, museum.
Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today. <+++++> Whoa! You had sex today?
Hang in there. You hang in there. <+++++> Did you say something?
Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while! <+++++> It 's still looks pretty far!
Hey Pheebs!  Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Okay. <+++++> I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice.  What you're-you're not mad?
Oh my God! Who 's gonna watch that?! <+++++> Thanks. You ready to go?
Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see. <+++++> He won't?
I didn't! <+++++> I saw you!
Oh my God! Oh my God! I 'm so sorry! <+++++> Aw forget it, it 's from Pier One.  Sorry.
Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! <+++++> I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
Push, push! <+++++> We're here!
No. <+++++> Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?
You're kiddin'. <+++++> It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know.  We're grown ups, this kinda stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore.
Oh, wait-wait-wait <+++++> You tell them to wait!
Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends. <+++++> Yeah!
Yeah, sure. <+++++> Thank you.
Okay, thank you.  It's the Italian Hand- Licker, isn't it. <+++++> No. It's the one he's licking.
Yeah. <+++++> Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her  and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.
Hey, tell Dan,  'Thanks.' <+++++> What?
Because the winner gets this! <+++++> The Geller Cup.
Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good. <+++++> Well, well, they're good. It's been a while since I've seen you like this. You, you clean up good.
Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get over her. <+++++> Yeah, that's true. Except I don't wanna get over her.
Why aren 't you moving your feet? <+++++> I 'm trying.
I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius. <+++++> Hello.
Full house. <+++++> You got me.
Oh that's mine too!  I'm Italian! <+++++> Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.
Well, there's you. <+++++> Better not be doin' these in order.
Yeah. <+++++> I 'm telling you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think he's baaad news!
It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York , and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco. <+++++> Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities.
Hey. <+++++> What is ah, Rach in her room?
She said,  "He's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl." <+++++> This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now , she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you- will you help me out here?
Nope. <+++++> No? What happened, big guy?
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot. <+++++> And we didn 't have sex.
And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again. <+++++> Thank you. I'm glad you agree.
Aw honey stop! It 's not that bad. <+++++> Yeah.  Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must 've added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.
Ross, please, don't be so scared of him! <+++++> I'm not scared of him, I'm really sick!
We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay! <+++++> Congratulations! Congrats!
Well, can I talk to you for a sec? <+++++> Okay.
All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right? <+++++> Yeah.
Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great! <+++++> Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don 't want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?
Y 'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour! <+++++> Yeah!
Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing? <+++++> No, it's not just that. It's just -I want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh...
Hey, guys. <+++++> Hey.
Enter Amy! <+++++> Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna...
5 6 7 8! <+++++> So, do we really have to ask who 's going up on the platform next?
I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today. <+++++> Well, ya know, someone should have called me.
Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman, our 50-year-old librarian. <+++++> How did you know that?!!!!
Oh my God! <+++++> Wow!
You mean there's more than one of us. <+++++> Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna.....
Damnit!! Did you move?! <+++++> Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place.  I'm Ross.
Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening? <+++++> You take your time.
Oww! <+++++> Wow! That aspirin dance really works!
Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out? <+++++> ...No, we hate him.
I 'm sorry, you're right. What am I gonna say?  Oh! <+++++> Yeah, tell me about it.
You 're no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole. <+++++> No, hi, I 'm, I'm an honorary Brown Bird
Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better! <+++++> Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!
Me too. <+++++> Hey! I just heard. What's up?
I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything. <+++++> It's ok. I'm sorry.
Oh-hooo, I missed you. <+++++> I missed you too.
Well, whatever works for ya <+++++> No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.
It's not just that she's cute, okay. It's just that... she's really really cute. <+++++> It doesn't matter. You don't dip your pen in the company ink.
It's seven years ago.  My time machine works! <+++++> We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.
Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet! <+++++> Hi, Pheebs!
Noo. <+++++> You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.
Because it says  "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom. <+++++> Oh.
Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember? <+++++> Ooooohhhh.
'Kay! <+++++> Oh my God!
Okay! <+++++> Hey!
Okay. I 'm going with you. <+++++> Why?!
So how'd it go? <+++++> Oh. Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin'?
Ow! <+++++> Okay.
Fourth gear!! <+++++> What?! What does he want?! I wasn 't doing anything!
Isn't that cute? <+++++> That is precious! Listen! I need Rachel's flight information.
Honey I swear it we just kissed. <+++++> It was just a kiss.
So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg? <+++++> No, we can go to Williamsburg.
Do I still call you Ross? <+++++> Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldn 't be more thrilled for both of you, but as Monica's older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down, and kick your ass!  What? I'm-I'm-I'm serious!  Come-Hey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? I'm-I'm not kidding here!
Oh my God. <+++++> You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y 'know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days? <+++++> Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what 's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Great. <+++++> Relax, I'll fix it.
Oh-ho-ho, we 've got company. <+++++> There 's nothing the matter with me. See, I'm not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.
Spring vacation. <+++++> Spring vacation.
You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too. <+++++> Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.
Well, who wouldn 't?! <+++++> I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it 's temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? "Professor Geller."
Hey umm, you brought protection right? <+++++> Why?! Are there like bears or something?!  Ohh. Oh, protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot.
Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there. <+++++> Ohh, this cake is really good!
Oh come on!! <+++++> Okay, seriously, what do you think?
Oh yeah. <+++++> And that 's Phoebe over there!
Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say. <+++++> What are you doing?
Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say,  "Hmm, noodle soup." <+++++> Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.
Who's your friend? He's hot! <+++++> Thanks man.
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy! <+++++> You can see where he'd have trouble.
Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing. He can't quite say mama yet, but once he said yumen. <+++++> Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen , I mean, I feel like-
No, I'm getting it. I'll be right back. <+++++> I got it -I'm getting it!
Oh, yeah, that's true. <+++++> Uh, I haven't.
He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! <+++++> Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?
I believe you know my husband. <+++++> So it 's really a question of who could you have possibly done.
Well what is it? What is it? If it 's gonna help bring the baby here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it. <+++++> It 's sex.
Who are those people? <+++++> Got me.
Yeah, oh I 'm sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya, it's a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I'm so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, 'cause-Oh! I'm pregnant! <+++++> Pheebs, did you want a cookie?
Oh yeah! Hey, save the cork and then we can fill the bottle with water and put it back so they don't charge you. <+++++> Oh my God, I love you.
No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes. <+++++> What? That's like insanely easy!
YES! <+++++> You were under the pile of coats?
Yeah. Y 'know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don't you think it's gonna be weird? <+++++> Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?
Oh please God, let there be a song. <+++++> There was no song.  There was no song!
Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes! <+++++> Hey!
Yeah. <+++++> It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it 's revealing which I'm fine with, no I'm concerned about your health, sun exposure.
It's a... <+++++> No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want to know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go.
Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me? <+++++> uhu uhu, check this out.
Too strong for me? <+++++> Yeah.
You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!! <+++++> What's going on?
No it is awesome! <+++++> Hi guys.
Hi. <+++++> Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.
Ohh, get these things out of me! <+++++> Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain.
But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly. <+++++> I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.
Nope! I can do this all day. <+++++> Yeah? Me too.  Gettin ' a little tired though.
All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it! <+++++> Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}
Y 'know what? This is not fair to her. Let's just forget the tape! <+++++> Thank you.  No!
I 'm sorry. <+++++> Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don 't, don't just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
Oh no, she 's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her. <+++++> Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn 't she know it's our anniversary?
This is ridiculous. <+++++> Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend Phyllis take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.
Yeah, but, there were no suds. <+++++> So?
Are you asking permission to break the pact? <+++++> Yes please.
Well, y 'know what? Thanks to you I'm half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I don't think I have ever been this angry! <+++++> What about the time I said we were on a break?
Hi. <+++++> Guess what?
Okay. <+++++> Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.
Why? <+++++> Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you 're wrecking it.
Ross, cough drops, please? <+++++> At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
It's locked. <+++++> Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're having sex on the couch, its like
We don 't make enough fun of you already? <+++++> Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.
Aww, Rach, I think you look cute  And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon . <+++++> Get away from me I said no!
You might wanna get back in there. <+++++> Ok!
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this. <+++++> You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! Come here
Not if you were here. <+++++> Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
No, no, no, no! <+++++> Okay, here we go...
Now umm, remember I 'm still learning. <+++++> One, two, three, four!
Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts. <+++++> Please tell me you're joking.
Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls! <+++++> Monica couldn 't tell time 'til she was 13!
You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again? <+++++> I don't know.
C'mon! <+++++> ...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.
Flowers, liquor, recarpet first floor. New guest bath, landscaping. I'm paying to remodel this guys house.  I'm going to give that son on a bitch, a piece of my mind. <+++++> Dad, dad, please. Look I don't want anything to upset Emily tonight. Alright, she's had a hard enough couple of days as it is.  Now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?
Y'know I can 't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!! <+++++> FINE BY ME!!
Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me. <+++++> And bus.
Oh thank you. <+++++> Hi ma.
Occupation? Dinosaurs. <+++++> Actually I 'm a palian Dinosaurs is fine the drawing is not.
Hey! <+++++> Phoebe!
Joey cracks me up! It's like, 'Yeah, why don't you have your ex-wife move in with you? That wouldn't be awkward at all!' <+++++> Huh uh-huh.
Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her. <+++++> Like what?
Oh, I really liked him.  Yeah, it was really, really, really good. <+++++> You promised you wouldn't say anything.
Oh my God!! <+++++> Congratu!!  -lations-lations.
Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya? <+++++> Tsz... NO! .
Yes! And while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of issues... <+++++> Oh! like what?!  Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch  "Access Hollywood".
Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out! <+++++> I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
I packed while you were gone. I left some knickers under your pillow. <+++++> Move in with me.
So, we 're having fun, right? <+++++> Yeah.
Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love. <+++++> Yep! That's hilarious!
Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it. That is <+++++> No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault and kind
So you can like, bite, and pull people 's hair and stuff? <+++++> Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
Maybe. <+++++> Don't toy with me.
Oh my God! <+++++> It's all right.
I don't think so. <+++++> Come on, you made coffee!
No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real?  Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again. <+++++> Come on! Joe!
Oh. <+++++> I'm done.
So you don 't have the cameras?! <+++++> No. Sorry man.
Hey, look, you guys, I'm going for anything here, OK? I cannot be a waitress anymore, I mean it. I'm sick of the lousy tips, I'm sick of being called 'Excuse me...' <+++++> Rach, did you proofread these?
Rust, is boat cancer, Ross. <+++++> Wow. I 'm sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that.
Aaah. <+++++> So, ah . . . So, how was it? Uh, did you guys. . . Did you guys have a good time?
Our table will be ready in a couple minutes. <+++++> Yeah. So
Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex? <+++++> Technically, huh, no.
Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom? <+++++> I actually had a topic in mind! I 'm, I'm kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.
Great. That would be fine. <+++++> Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared.
You're right. <+++++> So, can you trust me?
Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break? <+++++> What 's-what's the difference?
Why? <+++++> What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's like if a woman wanted to be...
So, how many have you sold so far? <+++++> Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
Here you go! <+++++> Chandler! Chandler!
What?! <+++++> Look, look I 'm sorry. It's just that....
Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room. <+++++> Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch! <+++++> You're kid's name is Raymond!
Yeah, I-I can 't-I mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just-I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I <+++++> See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y 'know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I I won't play anymore.
Hey! <+++++> Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.
So, do you want me to watch Ben for you? <+++++> Yes, that 's what I was going to ask, thank you.
Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today! <+++++> Wow!
Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! <+++++> Okay, okay, yes, it is.  How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.
Whoa-oh, what's-what's that? <+++++> Oh, that's me.
Really? <+++++> Yeah.
Wow, so your child is a big fan of the Waldo books too? <+++++> Yeah, that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way.
Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle? <+++++> Oh.
Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover? <+++++> Well, now I do!!
Oh! Okay!  You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me! <+++++> Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say
All-all right!  Start it up! Let 's go! <+++++> Woohoo!
You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this. <+++++> Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner! <+++++> Who?
There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000. <+++++> Are you intrigued?
I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom? <+++++> Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh...  I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.
Oh my God. You and Rachel? <+++++> I know, it's pretty great.
Oh...  Well... <+++++> Yeah...
Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you. <+++++> What am I going to do?
No wonder your pregnant. <+++++> Hey!
Hey there, you handsome thing. <+++++> Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio.
OK, hi again. <+++++> Hi Phoebe.
Yeah, maybe if you 're in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are we? <+++++> No but but still you can't possibly do this alone.
This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel! <+++++> Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!
Well, it 's time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling. <+++++> Let 's grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
Or ya know, he's rubber and you're glue. <+++++> 
I wasn 't invited. <+++++> Well then we 'll-we'll see you the day after tomorrow.  Mom?! Dad?!  What-what what you guys doing here?!
Oh my God. You 're even dumber than I am! <+++++> Excuse me?
Don 't do this to me, again. You'd know I'd stay here in a minute, but I'd really miss so much work, they'll fire me. <+++++> So, then you can stay as long as you want.
Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding. <+++++> Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.
Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe! <+++++> ...What shoe?
Ross, they are killing you out there! <+++++> That's not true!
Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine.  Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor <+++++> No!
Hey! <+++++> Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!
Well, you know, no suds, no save. <+++++> No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second.  That's my friend's machine.
I could die. <+++++> Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh,  "Yeah, I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch." <+++++> He sounds swell.
Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! <+++++> Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back-  come here, Marcel-
You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier! <+++++> Yeah. What are we gonna do?
Yes! <+++++> Get away!
Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it.  I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't.  Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy! <+++++> Hello.  Hi sweetie.  Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it.  So will you come to New York?
Oh, come on, miss, isn't there any way that you can just let me off... <+++++> No! No! Oh my God. Did she get off the plane? Did she get off the plane?
All I 'm saying is, it's one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don't know, like a  surprise!! <+++++> All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn 't mean you have unagi.
I don 't know, you thought 'See you Saturday' was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me. <+++++> Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
No, it's you! <+++++> Please.
That 's funny. <+++++> Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new  old sheet?
She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it. <+++++> Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant. <+++++> Your ex-boyfriend?
And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!! <+++++> Look, I didn 't think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.
So, I gotta get going. <+++++> Okay, I-I 'll see you tonight.
Oh my God Ross! What in heaven 's name are you doing here? <+++++> And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can 't get mad. <+++++> Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities.
All right well, y 'know I guess we know what we have to do to get down. <+++++> Yeah, I guess we don 't have a choice.  Help us! Please help us! We're stuck up on the roof and we can't get down!!!
You and Rachel. <+++++> What?  Why not?
Mornin ' <+++++> Mornin '
Well, the turkey's burnt.  Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined. <+++++> Here we come, walkin' down the -this doesn't smell like Mom's.
You know, I really don't feel very comfortable making this decision. You know, Phoebe knows you better, I'm gonna let her choose. <+++++> Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.
Oh I 'd like that. <+++++> Yeah?
Yeah? <+++++> Yes, I do.
You don't think my mom's sexy? <+++++> Well... not in the same way...
Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you  'cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don't punish your friends for what Rachel did to you. <+++++> Yeah, you 're right.
I don 't want him to tell this story for years. <+++++> Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
Ross, don't let her drink anymore! <+++++> Ohh, here's that Macadamia nut!
Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one? <+++++> No thanks.
Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby? <+++++> No-no, we talked about it. We don't want to know. All we care about is that it's happy and healthy.
Hey. <+++++> Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three. <+++++> Oh, see I-I don 't know if we're gonna be hungry at three.
Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were! <+++++> You may want to lose the foam finger!
It 's perfect. <+++++> And, I don 't know, if it starts to rain
Maurice. <+++++> Correct, his profession was?
Pulling what? It 's second down. <+++++> Okay, it 's second down.  Take all the second downs you need.
Hey hey, come on in! <+++++> Hey, hello! mmwa!  I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna.
Why not? <+++++> Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.
Guess what? <+++++> What?
Yeah, maybe... <+++++> Okay... okay, maybe I will...
Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y 'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too. <+++++> Y 'know, she tried to undress me too.
Great! <+++++> No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
I'm sorry, what did you just say? Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben just said 'Hi'. <+++++> Wha, what?
You can 't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So... <+++++> Ewwww!!
Do you love her? <+++++> We said it was only going to be two weeks, y 'know?
But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly. <+++++> I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.
I like those odds! <+++++> Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki.
Ok. <+++++> Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.
Hi Ross! You ready for breakfast? <+++++> Yep.  Okay.
Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria? <+++++> You still on that?
Chip! Hi, it 's Rachel.  Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message.  Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down.  Monica Geller.  Ohh. <+++++> Oh, that 's right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that's gotta be embarrassing!
Do you know where the store is? <+++++> No.
Look Ross, if you 're so freaked out, just get in the car! <+++++> With you?! Yeah right!
Hi. <+++++> M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.
What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there? <+++++> You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y 'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover. <+++++> Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities? <+++++> No, but ah, there 's coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.
Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do? <+++++> Look -Okay, I'm just gonna-I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table. <+++++> Oh my god. You are pure evil.
All right! All right! Uh, umm, Super-Speedy Speed round! <+++++> Is there a hopping bonus?
Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I 've missed the last 1200 times. <+++++> So why don 't you quit?
Okay, y 'know what? Can I, can I talk now? <+++++> Oh sure.
In a minute!!! <+++++> People ask me why we 're not together, I just don't know what to tell them.
Yeah right! <+++++> No really, I-I am! I feel bad!
Good. How are you? <+++++> Good.
Yeah. <+++++> Wait a minute! No! I 'm the nice one! I'm the one who danced with the kids all night! How How small are your feet?!
Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the... <+++++> At the coffeehouse, right.
Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed? <+++++> Sure, okay.
And that's not all I'm allergic to. <+++++> Oh, it's not over!
She 's right. <+++++> Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together.
Yeah, save it for the cab, okay. <+++++> What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.
It's never gonna happen. <+++++> What?
I do love Mike. <+++++> Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before, and you know what? You should be. It's a big deal!
I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were-you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut. <+++++> Oh, man!
Okay, hating this. <+++++> Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.
Me too. <+++++> Oh! Y'know, I 've got an extra futon.
We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel. <+++++> Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and...
Okay you have to realize, I was exhausted, I was emotional, I would have said yes to anybody. Like that time you and I got married!  I 'm not helping. <+++++> So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?
Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter 's machine!! <+++++> That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica. <+++++> I'm never gonna find love again.
Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean! <+++++> Yeeeeeep Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad 's boat she wouldn't let me help at all.
Oh no, I can 't. I got a date. <+++++> A date?
Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend. <+++++> What?!
Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women. <+++++> There are naked ladies there too.
Hm-mmm. <+++++> And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little
Did we not make ourselves clear the other day. <+++++> Yes, and that's why we're here.
Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning! <+++++> Well, I... I am having a good hair day.
Do you think that 's something that he'd be mad at you for? <+++++> I guess it could.
Sorry, I thought you were talking to me. <+++++> Rachel! I'll just call her back.
Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh... <+++++> Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free.
What happened to your teeth. <+++++> I whitened them.
Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too. <+++++> Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?
Thanks sweetie. <+++++> You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?
Well, how you died was funny. <+++++> Oh please, hit by a blimp?
Yes. <+++++> I am the guy who's taking care of our baby while you're out at bars meeting guys!
My God! <+++++> What do you think you 're doing?!
Hello? <+++++> Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we 'll be able to find a new place for the wedding.
Damnit Ross, get your butt out of the bathroom. <+++++> Calm down, I'm blow drying.
I did. <+++++> Does it always, uh--?
Huh. Nice to meet you. I 'll get started on this. <+++++> I don 't know why you can't admit that you need me.
Do you two know each other? <+++++> No. No.
I can see it now,  "Look dad, it's the Sphinx!" <+++++> Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than,  "Spring break!"  All right? I mean she's taken my class!
Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate! <+++++> Oh!
I have absolutely no idea. <+++++> That's... that's classic.
Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto. <+++++> ÃÂÃÂ¡Lo que sucedio es que no le gusta la tele!
Okay, here comes another camera. <+++++> Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
I understand, separation is hard. One time I was about to leave Ross to go to the beauty parlor and he got so upset, he took off all his clothes, tucked his ??? between his legs and cried out <+++++> Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.
I 'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone. <+++++> Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we 're gonna have younger looking skin!
You said I was boring--Ohh! <+++++> When did I say you were boring?!
Ok. So now, I think Emma is probably down for the night, but if you need anything Ross . . . <+++++> Rach, Rach, we'll be fine, all right? You go have fun.
Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit. <+++++> Well, it needs to be plicit.
Yeah, no, me neither. <+++++> Fine! It 's your life!  I just don't want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together,  but that 's what you want, there's nothing I can do.  DON 'T DO IT!!!!!
Oh, I love you too. But... <+++++> No but, no but.
Remind me to introduce you to someone! <+++++> Who?
Oh. <+++++> Are you not seeing him anymore?
Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin. <+++++> Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun. <+++++> Yeah. He could row like a viking.
I know, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great... <+++++> Can we, can we just stop for a second? Who said something better would come along, huh? You didn't believe me. I told you everything was gonna work out.  You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
You got married to fast. <+++++> That's not advice!
Can we come in? <+++++> Oh, come in.
My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon. <+++++> I gave him an extremely professional massage!
Ross, you 're being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces! <+++++> Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me. <+++++> Here you go.
Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute. <+++++> Wow! What a pleasure.
Hey uh, what 's with the candy? <+++++> Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater.
I think you should go. <+++++> What?
All right, so, so you went to Pete 's... <+++++> What happened?
I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman. <+++++> Nevermind!
What? <+++++> You're bleeding.
Oh God! <+++++> Oh! Oh my God oh! Oh my God she 's here.
So we are going on two? <+++++> All right!!
I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad. <+++++> And what did he ask you not to call him?
No. <+++++> No.
Oh yeah, that 's right, the keyboards, huh? <+++++> Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that 's-that's when I really found my sound.
Say it! <+++++> Y 'know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!
Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too? <+++++> Ohh.
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but <+++++> That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.
Not a one. <+++++> Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine. <+++++> Man! They cannot get enough!
Are you sure? <+++++> Yeah. Look if-if she 's gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn't find a better guy. So
Wow! That 's great! Dad must really like you, he doesn't ask just anyone to play. <+++++> Yeah and he didn 't really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.
It's so... something... You go girlfriend! <+++++> You've never said that in your life, have you?
Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I 'm related to Monica. How is she? <+++++> She 's fine. She doesn't know you're gone. And she doesn't have to know, okay? Now come on, we're going home.
We're uh, we're getting married. <+++++> As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married?
God! Ross! <+++++> I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...
Are you yelling at me?! <+++++> God no!
Cappuccino. <+++++> Grazie.
Hi <+++++> Hey!
Rachel!! Open up!! It's your sister!!  I have to talk to you!! <+++++> Hi Amy!
Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready? <+++++> Yeah!
Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean y 'know, emotionally, mentally, physically <+++++> Wow, that 's-that's-that's incredible.
Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke. <+++++> No, it 's my joke, it's mine. You can call them, they'll tell you.
I know I didn 't do well on my midterms and stuff but, I was kinda hoping you could change my grade. <+++++> And why exactly would I do that?
How many you want? <+++++> One.
Oh my God! <+++++> Yeah.
Hi! <+++++> Hey!  So, how was Atlantic City?
Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed. <+++++> Step back.
You WHAT? And I missed it? Because I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie? <+++++> Yeah, and it was uhm... it was like a real little person laugh too. It was... it was like uhm...  Only... only not creepy.
Oh, hi sweetie. <+++++> When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn 't want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing. <+++++> Still thinking about it huh?
I 'll go. <+++++> Yay!
So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y 'know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks. <+++++> Okay, she can 't go.
Oh yeah, that 's just a little something for my huge gay fan base. <+++++> Did you just wink at me?
Don 't worry about it Pheebs. <+++++> No one got me an engagement present.
Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I 've got a deadline, would you just go home, I'll talk to you later. <+++++> Yeah, but wait...
Come on guys! Let 's go! Come on, it's second down. <+++++> Uh, hello, it 's third down.
I don't see her. <+++++> Rachel! Rachel Green!
I don't have her number, butt-munch. <+++++> Well, she'll call back, don't be such a baby.
Hap.. Hap.. Happy Thanksgiving. <+++++> Hi.
Dealer takes two.  What do you bet? <+++++> I bet two dollars.
Oh y 'know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you. <+++++> Really?! Wow! That 's-that's so nice, what are you gonna get me?
Yeah! <+++++> And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!
You know, he was just doing his job... <+++++> Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can't... I can't go through with this.
Hey, maybe that's for the best. <+++++> Yeah?
I think she's OK. <+++++> 
Maybe you should put it off. <+++++> No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I mean, really happy. I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know.
Fine, whatever. <+++++> What's the matter?
The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice. <+++++> Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!
A lot. <+++++> Mm.
Okay that 's the green stuff talkin'. <+++++> No, I 'm serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if she's not where you are, then you can start to move past this.
Oh, slides.  So really nothing happened. <+++++> Something could 've happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them. <+++++> If you wanna call that a reason.
Yeah, isn 't that a cool name? <+++++> Yeah!
Y 'know what Ross? I'm not gonna let you get away with this! <+++++> I don 't think you have much choice.
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I 'm gonna go to the bathroom. <+++++> Yeah, take your time.
NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that. <+++++> E-except, except that what?
Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know.... <+++++> Hey Chandler, there 's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then.
Say 200? <+++++> 200 dollars.
Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone. <+++++> No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
How, how is this my fault? <+++++> Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.
Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said <+++++> Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,
Well, maybe it was God, doing me. <+++++> Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.
What? We could do it! <+++++> I don 't know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
Oh-no, y 'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night! <+++++> Yeah! We 'd meet, we'd meet total strangers, and hang out with them!
Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's. <+++++> God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.
I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay? <+++++> Okay.
Or, or the rodeo!! <+++++> That would be great.
Thank you. <+++++> We're not done.
Uhuh. <+++++> Rach, you don't have to call whenever you have a little question, okay? Trust me, I know this.
Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that. <+++++> It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
Hey! <+++++> Look at you! You 're up!
All right. <+++++> That sounds fair.
OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table. <+++++> Whoooaa!
Hey! <+++++> I 'm sorry I'm late, did I miss anything?
Hey. <+++++> Hey! How 'd the ah, basketball go?
Woo-hoo!! <+++++> Yeah, cheerie-o!
I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room! <+++++> Look, I took it too far!
You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli. <+++++> No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden.  No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye.
I usually prefer Elizabeth 's boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens. <+++++> Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.
Good luck, with your girlfriend. <+++++> Oh, thank you.  Hey, hey.  Rachel!!!!
Honey, I'm just checking. <+++++> Oh.
Yes. <+++++> Well, uh, does she like you?
Hi! <+++++> Hey.
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole. <+++++> Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?
Oh Maria. You can 't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym treat. <+++++> You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story. <+++++> I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but- but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
Stop what?! <+++++> I don 't know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I'll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!
Awesome, the name really stands out. <+++++> Thanks to a little something called "Helvetica Bold 24 point"!
O-kay!! See what you did, I 'm gonna be doing it by myself now. Okay? <+++++> Aww, come on.
Oh, she sees him! Oh, they 're hugging! <+++++> He 's taking her purse!
Hi. <+++++> Hi.
Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.  Dirk, this is my good friend Ross. <+++++> Nice to meet you.
That would be great! <+++++> Yeah, all right, it 's a date.
So shake it! <+++++> Shake it!
Uh, good. <+++++> Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
Alright. <+++++> I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
Yeah, yeah. It 's like my chance to give something back to the acting community. <+++++> Y 'know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God. <+++++> Well, there goes my whole belief system.
I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!! <+++++> Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
Hey look Ross, you need to understand something okay? I uh I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you. <+++++> Thank you.
What?! <+++++> I 'm sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.
Ohhhh! <+++++> Uh, unless! Unless, uh this lady wouldn 't mind letting you go first.
She puts the key into the ignition, which is on the left side of the steering wheel. Does anyone know why that is? It's a tradition left over from Porsche's racing history. The world's greatest endurance race is the 24 Hours of LeMans. Which is in France and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on Saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on Sunday.  In the 60s LeMans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track. At the start of the race, the drivers would run across the track, get in the car, buckle up, start the car, and drive off. Porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took. Since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel, that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat-belts, put the car in gear and start it. The driver's left hand did nothing. Porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24-hour race; moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat-belts with his right hand. That's why every Porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel.} <+++++> No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car!  Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now!
Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or... <+++++> Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.
What's going on? <+++++> Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working. <+++++> But, won't she notice I have makeup on?
Yes! And that 's why I'm under the table. Celebrating. <+++++> Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-one 's turned them.
Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times, <+++++> That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?
Okay. Hey -Ooh, cool sheets! <+++++> Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?
Wow! <+++++> Hello!
Okay, I 'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here. <+++++> Yeah, well nah.
The diapers? <+++++> In the hospital.
Ross you 're not listening to me, I don't have time to stop. <+++++> Come on Rach, you don 't have what, ten minutes?
Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street. <+++++> Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh,  "Keep your mitts off my grub?"
And! She uses sex as a weapon! <+++++> Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I 'll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.
Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea. <+++++> Pheebs, I think she 's great. Okay? We're going out again.
Right. <+++++> Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water?
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that? <+++++> Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.
You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?! <+++++> Why?
Oh I get it! A man duh! <+++++> Can I have everyone 's attention please? I'm uh; I'm Ross Geller.
Your work makes me sad. <+++++> Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass. <+++++> No, no, no, but...
Dr. Geller! <+++++> Burt!
Oh, hi Ross! <+++++> What are you doing?
Well, he 's never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week! <+++++> Hey, y 'know what? This is your fault! You're the one that didn't move his-his appointment.
They were lovers. <+++++> What?!
Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing. <+++++> What?
Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass! <+++++> Okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great.
So y 'know Ross it's funny 'cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married? <+++++> Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I 've been married and how I have a son.
Wait a minute, y 'know, you're bringing me! <+++++> What? I can 't cancel on Joan!
Well, aren't we Mr.  "The glass is half empty." <+++++> Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?
Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's still heavily sedated. <+++++> Ok, ok. I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you, I mean, you can't be alone right now.
You gave her a key to your apartment?! <+++++> Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship.
This is what I 've got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor. <+++++> Great. Great.
But I couldn't even if I wanted to, because I don't know! I swear; I didn't see anything, and I don't want to know! It was just a momentary lapse. <+++++> Momentary lapse. Don't-don't you have any self-control?
Oh my How much do you weigh Ross?! <+++++> I prefer not to answer that right now, I 'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
So, you're a paleontologist, right? <+++++> Yeah.
Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought. <+++++> Yeah, it 's hard okay, I only have two spots left.
Hey-hey! <+++++> Hi!
Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do? <+++++> I don 't know! I guess I just can't believe any of this is happening.
I don 't know. Is it crazy? <+++++> No! No it 's not. Joey, this is a smart idea.
Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they 're all gonna' make fun of her, do you want that? <+++++> Okay, okay, we 'll just get everyone to act like they like it. That- that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie!
Y 'know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through. <+++++> So what do you want me to do?
Oh yeah? Fine. <+++++> Hey, y 'know, y'know what would make me really happy?
I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier. <+++++> But...
Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we? <+++++> No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship. <+++++> Good.
Oh, it 's the best!  So, umm how's Monica? <+++++> Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she 's right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.
Are you sure? <+++++> Oh, sure! I 'm sure.
What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I 'm not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can't go if I break my leg. <+++++> Well I 'm jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won't have a father if-if I die!
Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don 't think that's just a little funny?! <+++++> I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?
Were you so late because you were burring this woman? <+++++> No, I 'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
Hey! Did you find the cameras? <+++++> No. Did you?
Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh. <+++++> What, what is it?
Um... Ross? <+++++> Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'
You don't like ice cream? <+++++> It's too cold.
What're you doing? <+++++> I'm sorry, my pie was, was in your hood. Now I just have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants and I'll be back in the hospital by 7.
Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about.  Hey. <+++++> Hey.
Wait, am I missing something though?  'Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way. <+++++> Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.
Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you 're not gonna come with me? <+++++> Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family. <+++++> So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now?
Oh, ah- the kid has it. <+++++> The kid...?  Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.
What? <+++++> Huh.
Well, just shimmy down me and drop! <+++++> Hi.
Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe 's song about? <+++++> The one with the cat. I gotta go, I 've got another date.
I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don 't think your son will think it's yours and be horribly traumatised? <+++++> Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
I see where you 're goin'! <+++++> What 's up with the greed Joe?
I still haven 't gotten a check for your half yet. <+++++> Do not give him any money!
Huh umm <+++++> What 's the matter?
I know! <+++++> I can 't believe it.  Can I tell you something? I'm a little mad at him now.
Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win? <+++++> I don't know, probably just invest it.
I know, I know, I know, I know. I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I'm good, I'm not gonna laugh anymore. OK put your hands back there. <+++++> No see now, now I can't because uh, I'm feeling too self conscious.
Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it 'd be really good. <+++++> Oh, I don 't, I don't, I don't know
Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out! <+++++> You know, I really don't want to get involved in you guy's relationship.
No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is. <+++++> I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
All right! Just hurry up! <+++++> Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we 're face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we're-we're butt to face.
Oh, that would be great!  I love him, I love him, I love him... <+++++> Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!
No way! <+++++> Yeah! They 're putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel 's gonna film it!
By me? <+++++> Oh, no!
Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job description. <+++++> Oh.
Excuse me? <+++++> Umm, say you 're gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?
Really? <+++++> I do.
Face to face, yeah! <+++++> Okay, here I go.
Are you, are you, are you sure it 's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child. <+++++> It 's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.
I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that. <+++++> You ate my sandwich?
Are you close with her? <+++++> Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in  the laundry room.
When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do? <+++++> I made fun of his accent.
No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy... <+++++> Right.
No. <+++++> Okay, Jasmine, please, please don 't. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?
It 's just some things I've been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff. <+++++> Okay.  Wow, it 's-it's 5
Hey, your English is getting better!! <+++++> Oh my God!
God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise! <+++++> I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff-
We were on a break! <+++++> That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
What?!! <+++++> I fell asleep!
Oh-oh, that 's your thing. <+++++> What?
Yeah. <+++++> So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?
Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to Hi! <+++++> Thanks.
Hmm. <+++++> I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
Hi. <+++++> Hey-hey Pheebs!
Congratulations! Wow!! <+++++> So, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared, or  did he cry?  Yeah, big surprise, I like proposals!
I've come here to apologize. I think I may have let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process. <+++++> No! Stop!
Ross! Y 'know what, I just got-why? Why did you do this?! <+++++> Look I told you
No, I know, I know, that this is Frank 's life,  y'know. Y'know, I don't want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it's sick and wrong! <+++++> Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?
How 'd the lecture go? <+++++> It went great! And I didn 't need any jokes or naked chicks either!
How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might. <+++++> Oh...
Right. Wow! <+++++> Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, I 'm sure I can make it this time. I just I just can't be afraid to get a little bit hit by cars.
Ross has some big thing to tell everyone. <+++++> Uhh, okay, it 's uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.
Oh! Oh! <+++++> No!
Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter. <+++++> Ahhh.
Okay. <+++++> Hey.
Hello. <+++++> Hey!
Hi! My boss let me off early, so I took the train. <+++++> Oh.
Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you. <+++++> Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines!    'Sup?
Uh You didn 't propose to me, Chandler didn't propose to me, but Joey did. <+++++> Joey proposed to you?
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you 're, you're, you're making this too hard. <+++++> Oh I 'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
Look at this, how did I spend so much money? <+++++> Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due.
Potassium. <+++++> Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?
You want my advice? <+++++> Yes! Please!
What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?! <+++++> O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she 's really upset we're just talking.
What? They will be! <+++++> All right, that 's it, I'm getting out of here.
Saraaah. <+++++> Hey!
Not to mention the cold sores. <+++++> And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.
Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage? <+++++> Rach, come on, if you think about it, it 's actually kinda funny.  Okay, maybe it's best not to think about it.
Yeah. <+++++> Okay. Well, apparently Chandler 's angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?! <+++++> You don't, you don't know what your wearing?
Same category? <+++++> According to Chandler, what phenomenon scares the bejeezus out of him?
Wow, that's pretty cool <+++++> Huh? So? We have a deal?
Yeah, in a poem maybe. <+++++> No the man 's right, that's what I had with Rachel.
...love you. <+++++> Are you're hands still wet?
It's me! <+++++> Oh!  Ah.  Aw!
Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What? <+++++> No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's
When is Santa coming? <+++++> Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?
I 'll never get to be a best man! <+++++> Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?
Don 't call us that! <+++++> The judge wouldn 't let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?
Oh, so everything's okay? <+++++> Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing guy.
So you're up for keynote speaker! Who's making the decisions? <+++++> Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today.
You got it! <+++++> All right!
A ten speed bike. But, I 'd rather have something my Dad couldn't sell. <+++++> Well, that makes sense.
Ross, it 's not that big a deal! So you'll been divorced three times, you'll still have a life, you'll go on dates <+++++> No! No, I won 't! I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.
Well sure, if you say you 're gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms!  All right, now I'm gonna do this my way and I don't want to hear a peep out of you! <+++++> Okay Rach, but
Oh my god, I left the water running. <+++++> Rach you did not leave the water running. Please, just pull yourself together, okay?
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower! <+++++> Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I 'm gonna kill myself, I swear. I can't, I can't watch this.  Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she's going in.
He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that. <+++++> Look, it's just a little more complicated...
Yes, and now he 's using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say,  "Well done!" Bravo Meg. <+++++> Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I 'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth--Nothing!!
Dude, if you go back out there, you 're gonna be Dead Ross! <+++++> I don 't care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
Now, does it really matter? <+++++> Yes!!
All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can 't believe I screwed this up! <+++++> I 'm sorry man.  Here's a thought. This is the same ballroom. There's a band. There's gonna be plenty of dressed up people.
I was trying to help out a squirrel. <+++++> You were trying to eat it!
No, no, this is not what I ordered. Ok? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for my daughter 's birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now! <+++++> Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby 's face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. . That is a weird sentence!
Well, Kathy 's last boyfriend was Joey. <+++++> And you 're afraid you won't be able to fill his shoes.
Wow! I can 't believe that's our baby. <+++++> Yeah, that 's our baby.
We want you to speak to a psychiatrist. <+++++> Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.
Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out! <+++++> Okay, okay, I 'm sorry, it will never happen...  Uh-oh! Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I'm the king.
Ross, it 's going to be okay. I'm not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us. <+++++> Really?
I 'm pressing, a policeman is on his way. <+++++> Okay, okay! I 'm going. I'm going.
Uh, I think he 's in Rachel's room. See ya. <+++++> Chandler?  Chandler?
Why would you even want to come Ross? You 're a horrible skier. <+++++> Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.
Score! Where are the disposable cameras? <+++++> What disposable cameras?
Well, please welcome... The Snufflebumps... Who wants to be mr. Wigglemunch and who's gonna be the Grumpus? <+++++> Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?
Look at you. All jealous. <+++++> Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, she 's more.. y'know, and you're more
Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out. <+++++> Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don 't I have to wait a while?
It 's a different guy! <+++++> Good evening officer.
No. That 's not what I'm saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain. <+++++> I like that.
The other us. <+++++> Ok.
You know, I can't tell it again... <+++++> And I'm fine never having heard it...  Rach, can I... can I see you for a sec?
Mike doesn't ever wanna get married. <+++++> Never?
Hey guys. <+++++> Hey Mon.
Seriously, what is she doing? <+++++> Uh lately, she just likes hanging out here.
Hi! <+++++> Hey!
Yay! It 's so exciting! Wow, you could've done that with us there. <+++++> Yeah right.
Oh, you 're totally welcome! What'd she say? <+++++> She said,  "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she said, "Thank you."
You want some?! <+++++> No! Okay! Okay!  Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to you for a second?
Oh my God. <+++++> You did it, man.
No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please! <+++++> You want me to take some girl I 've never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.
Why don't you take Ross? <+++++> Uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn...
One, two, three, four! <+++++> You know the song! Sing along!
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say? <+++++> Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it.
What?!! <+++++> I fell asleep!
Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me. <+++++> What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even...
Oh God. I'm so sorry. <+++++> Hey! Wha-hoo! What's this?  Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?
Yeah, well, I couldn 't find any cards, so it was either this or Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff. <+++++> Okay,  Fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect two cool points. Yeah.
What are you supposed to be? <+++++> Remember the Russian satellite, Sputnik?  Well, I 'm a potato or a spud. And these are my antennae.  So Sputnik, becomes  Spud-nik. Spudnik!
You do know that Wham broke up? <+++++> I like it, and Emily likes it, and that 's what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?
Because I'm very happy for him!  And you , you lucky dog! <+++++> Hi!
Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was. <+++++> Who?
Correct again! But, you forgot to switch legs between questions, so no hopping bonus! <+++++> Noooo!!! Every time!!!
Hey! <+++++> Hi!
Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent. <+++++> Phoebs, It's open! It's open!
Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first. <+++++> I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.
Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father. <+++++> Uh-huh.
Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-... Hey sailor. <+++++> Is this what you had in mind?
Oh the humanity. <+++++> Meth-methane smells
Who? <+++++> Oh, just this woman I've been seeing.
Well, I don 't know!! <+++++> We fell asleep! That is all.
Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community. <+++++> I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy!
All right. Have you said,  "I love you?" You could say, I love you. <+++++> Yeah I-I don 't-I don't think I'm quite there yet, but I could say I looove spending time with you.
Me and Ross. <+++++> No need to point, she knows who Ross is.
Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I can -you have so crossed a line. <+++++> Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way.
SURPRISE!!! <+++++> What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.
Hey Rach, hey you. <+++++> Here she is!
Sometimes we were. <+++++> Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?
Well, I don 't know. Are you a masseur? <+++++> Yes I am.
I just had a rough night. <+++++> Oh. Crab cake?
They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it? <+++++> Would it matter?
You did a good thing today. <+++++> Yeah.
So, I think you 're boxes are over here. <+++++> Wow! Great!  Wait, dad who-who 's cigarettes are these?
Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can't believe he would do this to Monica! <+++++> I know, and with the baby coming?
What? <+++++> There's something new in the bowl.
Miss? Are you boarding the plane? <+++++> Hey, hey. I know you love me. I know you do.
Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys. <+++++> Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.
That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her. <+++++> Okay, 'you' can't, or  you can't?  Okay, that's my finger.  That's, that's my knee.  Still doing the play. Aaah!
You mean, you mean 30 days? <+++++> Yeah.
Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this...  HUGE engagement ring! <+++++> OH!
All right look, Ross, he 's right. Emily's great, she's great! But this way too soon, you're only gonna scare her! <+++++> I don 't want to do that.
Rachel! <+++++> Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan
Last night. <+++++> Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.
Please, I think you know why. <+++++> I can 't think of anything.
Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding? <+++++> I don 't know. A month?
No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit. <+++++> She said what?
Could've been a peach. <+++++> Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the-  -the bus stop... I'm fine.
I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word. <+++++> Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me "Daddy" too.
Yeah, I 'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall. <+++++> Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
Hey, y 'know what? I was wrong. <+++++> Well, we 're all here! I guess we should get going!
Hey, for what it 's worth, with Rachel I don't think you'll ever be just  "anybody." <+++++> Hey there you go!
Then why do you ask?! <+++++> Okay, wish me luck.
Ohh, it 's time to go. <+++++> Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock 's a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on. <+++++> Carol?
Hey! <+++++> Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application.
Oh. <+++++> So, we 're off.
Are you guys gonna be okay? <+++++> Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time.
Am I in it? <+++++> Uh, huh. Yeah, right after I thank everyone for giving money to the museum, I sing a song about the wonder that is Joey.
Hey, don't get religious on me, ok.  A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here sit down.  Ready?  Ahh!!  Ohh, yeah!! Huh?! <+++++> So what, we just sit?
What'd you do, dip it in sugar? <+++++> Look, G. I. Joe 's in, Barbi 's out. And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'
Dude! He's right there! <+++++> I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
Oh hey, don 't worry about it man. Don't worry about it, no big deal. <+++++> Yeah but still, I mean it should 've been me. I'm the dad.
Yes dear. <+++++> I can't believe you guys are moving in together. That's, that's great! I mean...I'm happy for you guys..
Take the top down did ya? <+++++> Only way to fly.
How does she do that? <+++++> I cannot sleep in a public place.
Yeah. <+++++> I can.
Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentine's Day. <+++++> Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine's Day? What's going on, huh? Girl trouble?
Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating. <+++++> Really?! We are?
Give her some money. <+++++> I really think they 're out of rooms.
Are you gonna dress up as Santa? <+++++> Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.
Oh, some guy she met at the movies. <+++++> Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her?
Hey. <+++++> Hey.
Hey, cheer up! You 're gonna see her again, right? <+++++> Well I, that 's the thing, I don't know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said,  "This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let's just enjoy "
How are you? <+++++> Hey.
Well I don 't know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could <+++++> Dad, dad I don 't want to hear about it.
Hey, whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me. Y'know, actually once-once I got dumped during sex. <+++++> Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?
Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit was later covered by a popular British invasion band? <+++++> Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.
Hey! I missed you. <+++++> Oh, I missed you too.
She really said that? <+++++> Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid! <+++++> Are you wearing two belts?
 <+++++> No, I fold.
What was that? <+++++> Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...
Okay. Now you 're gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story. <+++++> I 'll try to control myself.
Rachel's not here. <+++++> Oh.
I 'll get our seats. <+++++> Okay.   So uh, well, this-this is uh, this is awkward.
What was it? <+++++> Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out.
Well, I did and it hurt.  That's when I wrote the song <+++++> Man... I... I'm sorry.
Then we agree? <+++++> Uh yeah, I guess -Yeah! I guess so.
Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like this <+++++> Hey man.
Man, this sucks! Y 'know if Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who's gonna be the losers then? <+++++> Hey, I know what 'll get us up on a platform!
Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you 'd be out partying with Gandel-worf. <+++++> It 's Gandolf, and he's not coming.
You are going downer! <+++++> Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?
Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming. <+++++> Right.
See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now. <+++++> Yay!
Oh come on Ross, we 've done it before we'll do it again, it'll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy. <+++++> This is insane, I 'm not gonna make love to you just so that you'll go into labor.
I have a gun <+++++> O-ok. Just relax, Phoene, just stay calm. . Oh my god, I can't find my wallet.
Yeah well, we 'll see. <+++++> You kissed her.
Well, actually it... <+++++> No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people.
Why are you being weird? <+++++> Do you like it?
Which do I like? <+++++> Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...
Oh yeah, I 'd actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea. <+++++> Uh, double latte, extra foam.
Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it. <+++++> All right, show's over. Nothing to see here.  Ok, let's do laundry.
That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand. <+++++> FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!!
 <+++++> ...Yeah.
No, I sat in the paint. <+++++> Hey.
So, you just let her go? <+++++> Yeah.
I think she would like that. <+++++> Come here, here, come here, come here,  Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend 's mother.
So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her? <+++++> Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.
You've got to face the red light. When the red light goes on the spraying is about to start so close your eyes. When the spraying stops, count to five. Pat yourself down to avoid drip marks then turn around so we can get your back. Got it? <+++++> Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.
Ahh, then you have to give us the lawn ornaments. <+++++> I go back there with lawn ornaments, he's going to laugh in my face.
Ross, we we have to be strong. Okay, I-I'm gonna go.  Can I? To remember you? <+++++> No.
Were both of those Joey? <+++++> Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.
He started it! <+++++> No, you started it.
Who? <+++++> Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone 's name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
All right you two, I 'm gonna get going. <+++++> Oh.
I wanna quit the gym. <+++++> It 's okay man, be strong.
Ross, you don't know that. <+++++> Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village.  And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.
Shake that nasty butt... <+++++> Baby got back
Really? <+++++> Yeah! I don 't know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of sexy professor vibe?
Honey, I don 't think that's something we need to worry about! First of all he's-he's never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how she'd react. <+++++> Sure, because women never like Joey. Y 'know, I think he's a virgin.
All right! <+++++> Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay.
No, it's just... I was enganged to a guy who turned out to be gay! <+++++> Hey! High-five!
Come on Ben. <+++++> Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y 'know, for like two hours, and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee. <+++++> You were at the coffee house!
Come on! <+++++> What happened? Joey?
What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it? <+++++> I'm in.
Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don 't wanna have to have a separate room for you too!! <+++++> Okay, okay, okay.  I 'll get the bagels.
Wh-what 's that? <+++++> And you told Phoebe you were engaged.
Ross, I swear, I don't know. <+++++> Oh, come on, you know it's a girl!
Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb. <+++++> You're kidding. Oh my God.
Nothing, you just have to be cool with it. <+++++> Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
Yeah. <+++++> Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived!  Here.
Oh no-no-no, it 's only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners. <+++++> Yay!!
Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule! <+++++> Yeah!
Do you want me to pick you?! <+++++> See, I would never snap at you like that.
Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with it... <+++++> Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!
Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, and -oh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well! <+++++> That's great! That's wonderful!
Ain't that bad yet, but it keeps getting darker for the next four hours. <+++++> So, how dark is it gonna get?
Yeah. <+++++> Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom!
Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!!  Huh. <+++++> Well what is it? Is it a mole?
Why don 't we what? <+++++> Get married.
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't . . . I don't really like to talk about it. <+++++> That's okay. We'll talk about  something else.
Oh, let's not tell this story. <+++++> Oh, come on!
Hi you. I can't believe I'm waking up next to you. <+++++> I know it is pretty unbelievaaaaah.
Oh no-no, I-I had my eyes closed so I could concentrate and y 'know take it all in. <+++++> Yeah, a lot of my students do that.
Oooh... I really can't hear what she says come here. <+++++> You gotta be at least bi...
Really? But I 'm being so unreasonable. <+++++> True, but you 're allowed to be unreasonable. You're having our baby.
Yeah?  Hi! <+++++> Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.
Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce? <+++++> I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens.
I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she 's gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original. <+++++> Why did you do that?
What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me. <+++++> Please be kidding.
....with?? <+++++> Funny story!
Ross, it's just a sandwich! <+++++> Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
She's got her cell, you could call her. <+++++> I am not doing this over the phone.
Oh yeah? Okay. <+++++> Okay.
Ah yeah, sorry about that. <+++++> It 's okay. Come, come on in.
Maybe we can like go to a movie or something. <+++++> Okay.
Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal! <+++++> I'm good, I have dinner plans .
I 'm sorry, I'm with a client right now. <+++++> Phoebe!
Really?! <+++++> No! But we-we didn 't have sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don't remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?! <+++++> What? What? What? What is it?
Okay. <+++++> Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom
Hey. <+++++> Hey. How did you sleep?
Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight. <+++++> 
...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes. <+++++> No no no!
Ya know, I'm going to take off. <+++++> So soon?
Yeah, there you go! <+++++> Second date!
Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi. <+++++> Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything.
Okay, all right, this is how it 's going to work. We're gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest. <+++++> No, 10 is the highest.
Or Carol! But they 're funny to kids and who is it hurting?! <+++++> Uh, y 'know what? I'll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal's office wearing nothing but a catcher's mitt!
We 're really sorry, but um, she did ask us first. <+++++> Yeah, that 's okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I 'm alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again? <+++++> Yes, you can, very much.
I'm just cleaning up. <+++++> D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
You can say that because she's not your mom. <+++++> Oh, please...
I have to! Okay? It's time!  Okay, I hate dogs. <+++++> What?
Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I 'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game. <+++++> What?! The guys against the girls? See, that 's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns.
Eww!! <+++++> So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?
Chandler! <+++++> Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd 's Pie!
No. <+++++> Then you are neither of your parents!
Y 'know, you are 12 years older than her. <+++++> Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?
Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop. <+++++> It 's still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!
You think about stuff like that? <+++++> Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.
You've being seeing someone? <+++++> Yeah, didn't I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we haven't being going out for too long, but rather there is this
Oh my God! My dog died! <+++++> What?!
Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little? <+++++> I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath. <+++++> It 's okay, I'm ready.
Oh hello Ross, where have you been? <+++++> Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.
Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is! <+++++> That 's okay Rach, we're not liking Ross right now.
Hey. Whoa, hey, you've been working out, huh? <+++++> Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!
The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games! <+++++> Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
Okay, even this is turning me on! <+++++> Hey!
So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? <+++++> Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...
No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go. <+++++> Alright.
Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse. <+++++> Well, howdya feel?
Yes you did, gleba is a word! <+++++> Ok, use it in a sentence.
And everybody has to wear costumes.  Come on! It'll be fun! <+++++> Well, I 'll-I'll be there. I mean I have to wear a costume to all my classes that day anyway so
Alright, I can't, I can't wait that long. You have to do something-knock that door down! <+++++> I would, but I bruise like a peach. Besides, y you know, everything is gonna be fine. The baby's sleeping.
So it 's okay to date a student. <+++++> Well, not really. I mean technically it 's-it's not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work! <+++++> Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.
I 'm Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me. <+++++> All right, there you go!
Good! <+++++> Keep pushing!
Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid -Op! Op! <+++++> This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
So would I. You wouldn 't think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera. <+++++> Would you excuse us for a second?  Umm . what are you doing?
I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going. <+++++> Um, you know, just out of curiosity...
Okay, well, my cell phone number is right here on the counter, please help yourself to anything in the fridge. <+++++> What?
Regular Celery!  Oh, I already have that. <+++++> Done! With time a-to-spare.
Ross, that was 16 years ago! <+++++> That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.
Lookin' good Mr. Cotter. <+++++> You look pretty tonight.
I don 't know, what's a koondis with you?  Please, lie down! I've got a sav that oughta shrink that right up. <+++++> I guess it 's worth a try.
Noo! I 'll stay. He's my brother. <+++++> What a pity stay?
Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions. <+++++> Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women don 't even feel them.
Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands. <+++++> My hands?
I'm not gonna gooo. <+++++> You're not going to go.
I 'm just visiting my good friend Carol. <+++++> Your good friend?
Goodnight. <+++++> Look at that, they won't even turn their heads.
Together? <+++++> Uh huh.
No, look, I don 't know what else to do. I said I'm sorry! <+++++> Joey!
Yeah, maybe. <+++++> Well good, okay. I-I, kind of think y 'know if we if You're wearing the ring.
Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? <+++++> Yeah.
Right! <+++++> Y 'know-thanks!
Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it. <+++++> Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees.
Yeah. That's okay, right? <+++++> Par-tay!
Wait you stole those from these people 's wedding? <+++++> No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby. Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming.  Hey! My sweater! I 've been looking for this for like a month!
Thank you. <+++++> Pretty amazing huh?
You? <+++++> Yeah!
Fine.  Hi! Yes, I 'd like to order a large pizza. <+++++> No anchovies.
Oooh. <+++++> With mealworms.
So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon. <+++++> Ohhh.
Well honey, what about you? <+++++> What?
If anyone asks, we 'll just say Ben addressed them.  Oh! So you invited Rachel then? <+++++> Sure. Why not?
Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny. <+++++> Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?
Ninety percent of a women 's pheromones come out the top of her head! That's why, that's why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them!  Oh come on Ross, you're a scientist. <+++++> I was hugging her as a friend. It 's not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she's got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh coconutty.  What?! Oh, that doesn't mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!
Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me. <+++++> What kind of problem?
It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone. <+++++> Oh-oh really?
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message. <+++++> Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
I 'm ready! <+++++> You sure?
Y 'know, every year I say I'm gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it. Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together? <+++++> Together? Like-like to people?
Okay! I was thinking if it's a girl, how about Sandrine? It's French. <+++++> Huh. That's a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.
So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner. <+++++> Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we 're gonna break-up instead.
Oh. <+++++> But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?
Oh, there 's no such thing as an innocent burger. <+++++> So, are you gonna see him again?
Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I don 't <+++++> Okay.
No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks! <+++++> Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.
Were you guys making fun of Parker? <+++++> That depends, how much did you hear?
Why?! <+++++> Well you need 60% to pass
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross. <+++++> Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
Got stood up, huh? <+++++> Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.
Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous! <+++++> Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered
Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to. <+++++> Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.
Hey, what are you doing here? <+++++> Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of MASH and half the hostages coming home?
No, he was this creepy guy from high school who had this huge crush on her since like the ninth grade. <+++++> Still me.
What's with all the bottles of liquor? <+++++> What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?
Yep! <+++++> See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour? <+++++> Why don 't they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that's a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That's fun too! Whew!!
Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section <+++++> Yeah?
You! <+++++> Oh.. you don't get it!
We 're getting married! <+++++> Come here, come here. Uh,  ow! Emily, will you marry me?
Ross, we're kind of in the middle of diner here. <+++++> Oh, well, er, I already ate, but sure...!  Guess what happened at work today...
Watching ballroom dancing? <+++++> Yes! That 's where we realized we were both super cool people!
That was her. <+++++> What did you do?
Who wrote it? <+++++> Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her! <+++++> Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like  ten minutes left!
You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow. <+++++> Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?
We don 't have to. <+++++> Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie? <+++++> Oh yeah, why not?
Hey!  Hey! <+++++> Hi!
All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun! <+++++> Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait-wait!
Did you cut this couch in half? <+++++> This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half!
Sorry. You look good too. <+++++> Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh...
God, he's good. <+++++> If only he were a woman.
Oh, the guys are here. <+++++> this summer?
Oh,   "you do, do you"? <+++++> You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there  and pretend you 're a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!! <+++++> Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that 's not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there's a concept you should really be familiar with. It's what the Japanese call  unagi.
What? When was this? <+++++> Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.
Oops. <+++++> What was, what was that?
What? <+++++> They published my paper.
What?!! <+++++> Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you 're obsessed with her. It's always, "Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?" "Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel?" "When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?" You want her!
Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh. <+++++> Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.
So, what'd you tell him? <+++++> Just a second!
I wanna sleep, I wanna eat, I wanna take a shower, I mean before she wakes up and we gotta do this all over again. <+++++> Right.
All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris. <+++++> Yeah...
Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh? <+++++> Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. <+++++> Yeah.
Professor Geller? <+++++> Yeah?
You had to ask. <+++++> Yeah.
I'm sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but this has been lovely. <+++++> Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.
Really? <+++++> Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby.
Yeah but you don 't need--What is this? <+++++> Thread!
I'm kidding! <+++++> Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them. <+++++> So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?
Puerto Rican. <+++++> Two, I think a two.
Yeah, I mean, you should play in public! <+++++> Wow! Thanks, you guys. That 's uh-ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I'll be right back! Okay?  This is so nice, I'm-I am so
Oh, about five minutes. Right now they 're interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves. <+++++> Hot dog?
Hey. <+++++> Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?
No, let me finish. <+++++> No, you let me fini...
Wait a second, I could star in it! <+++++> Or that.
I 'm here! <+++++> Hey!
Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out! <+++++> Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!
And who laminated it? <+++++> That would be me.
Hey, Ross, you're okay with that? <+++++> Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.
Yeah. <+++++> Oh Rach that 's great. That's great.
Well, yeah. <+++++> Okay. Well, thanks, ah, thanks for the beer.
What?! <+++++> What?!!!
Ohh! Ew! <+++++> Oh that 's not pretty.
You fell asleep?! <+++++> It was 5
You 've been married twice? <+++++> Yes. And another time after that. Boy I 'm getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?
Great nap. <+++++> It really was.
I 'm not even I'm not even <+++++> Fine, y 'know what, that's it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.
Or! You can just, y 'know <+++++> What the hell are you doing?
I didn't get it. <+++++> Good for you.
Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt,  and I think my testacles may be in here too. <+++++> Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog! Y'know Monica couldn't get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.
Hi, honey. <+++++> Hi, Julie.
No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her body is soo... <+++++> Get to the problem!
I was not ready for this today! <+++++> Amazing... amazing.
Between you and <+++++> Gunther.  Hey-hey! Why don 't we put them on? Y'know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.
Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how 's it going with her? <+++++> Well, actually it 's been great. She's 20 so she's not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.
Thank you, thank you very much. If everyone will please take your seats, dinner will be served. <+++++> Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six.
All right, well finish your coffee; let 's go. <+++++> Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.
Pizza delivery! <+++++> I'll get it! I will get that!
Elizabeth! <+++++> Call me!
Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff. <+++++> That's okay, Joe.
You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true. <+++++> Gimme the bottle.  Gimme the towel.
Tuesday. <+++++> Tuesday right. Ok, bye you guys.
No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler. <+++++> Sweet!
Jacket now. <+++++> What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.
Ross... <+++++> No, no, no, I'm sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney's?
Uh-huh. <+++++> Way to go guys. Y 'know, you-you were really good at the stuff too.
Thank you so much. <+++++> How hot is this?!
 <+++++> 
Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET. <+++++> Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.
What is this? What are we doing? <+++++> Shh. Do you want cran-apple or cran-grape?
But you know what might really cheer me up? <+++++> What?
Thanks. <+++++> Hi! Hi, I 'm uh Ross. I'm here to ruin this magical day for you.
Hey! Look, if it didn 't work it's because you didn't tell it right! Show me how you did it. <+++++> No! No, I don 't don't want to.
So, did you talk to Joey? <+++++> Uh, no... no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.
Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen! <+++++> Playpen?! Ben 's seven!
Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That 's not the reason she's not inviting me! <+++++> Oh what 's the big deal?! I wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y'know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we'll-we'll leave early as a sign of protest.
Uh, Ross. <+++++> What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!
Don 't you point your pants at me!  We have no choice! Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about. <+++++> The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we 're getting married.
Just a job! <+++++> Yes.
I mean don 't you trust her? <+++++> Well, yeah!
'.... Won't you, won't you, won't you.... ' <+++++> Won't you dance around with me.
So you still hadn't heard from Emily? <+++++> No, not since I lost her at the airport.
Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are we going to do? <+++++> It 's all right! Everything's gonna be all right.
Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose. <+++++> Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll take this. Excuse me. <+++++> Ranion's theory of species variegation?
What? <+++++> 'Why don't you call him?!' Well, thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!
Ross, you remember Susan. <+++++> How could I forget?
Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this? <+++++> Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?
What did, what did he say? <+++++> Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . .
Me too. Alright, whattaya got. <+++++> Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush.
Y'know what? I 'll think you'll play. <+++++> Oh really! Why is that?
Okay, he's a senior in college. <+++++> College?
Ah... Well, obviously I think so too. <+++++> Well, I'm so excited about this.
What's going on? <+++++> I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it.
Wow, that's a big cable bill! Huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn on a Saturday afternoon?!  I was in the house! <+++++> Hey, uhm, Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that
Sarah. <+++++> "... Sarah. I dig you ", Uh? "Doctor Ross Geller".
Have you been working out? <+++++> I have been working out.
No! <+++++> Uh-oh, saved by the bell.  Hello?
I mean this is so great! We 're gonna be baby buddies! <+++++> Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby 's ears!
Okay. <+++++> All right, gentlemen, you 're up first.
Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody! <+++++> Happy Thanksgiving!
Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job! <+++++> What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.
Oh yeah. <+++++> What about the guy from the bar?
Hey. <+++++> Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.
Mr. and Mrs. Bing! <+++++> Wow Monica! Hey, just so you know I had my uh, older brother chat with Chandler.
Of course they 're listening to you! Everybody listens to you. <+++++> Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
Oh, good. <+++++> So uh... I guess I wanna take off.
Well who would? <+++++> Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want Monica and Chandler.
Oh, yeah. <+++++> Oh, hello.
Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City. <+++++> Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.
Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing. <+++++> Yeah.
Why?!! <+++++> Uh well umm we're just not in that place, y'know? But we're very excited about this.
Sandy made Madeleines. <+++++> This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks.
Hey. <+++++> And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me.
Noo! Maybe! I, I don 't know. <+++++> What?!
I'd love to! <+++++> Great!
Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend! <+++++> Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
I gotta make up the guest bedroom.  Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days. <+++++> Cassie?
Did they just kill off Joey? <+++++> No.
Really? <+++++> Really. It's always been you, Rach.
Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the way there's no law against. And then we're gonna grab some food, so if you want... <+++++> ... finally...
Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I 'm funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now I'm telling you, I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore. <+++++> All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.
What's the matter with Rog? <+++++> Yeah.
Uh, actually, that's.. <+++++> Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!
Hi! Oh, I 'm so glad you called. <+++++> Really? I 've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
Wait, how long? <+++++> Until we start to look very small.
Eight whole days. <+++++> That 's right, and that's why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.
You're married more than once? <+++++> No.
Nooo! <+++++> And it works both ways.
We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves. <+++++> What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. . <+++++> Halftime.
It's hard isn't it? There's almost no time for a social life. I mean, where are you gonna meet someone? <+++++> Well, let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the pediatrician's office.
The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them? <+++++> No you didn 't.
Hi Dr. Long, how are you? <+++++> Oh, you 're nice to her.
Totally and completely healthy! <+++++> Oh, that's great, that is great!
Seriously dude, 3 years ago. <+++++> Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
No, she left a message.   But it-it kinda got erased. There's just  something wrong with your machine. <+++++> Well, okay, what-what did she say?
Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her.... <+++++> Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?
HI!! Hi! <+++++> What?! What?!
Ross, I hated you when we were kids. <+++++> You hated me when we were kids?
You do? <+++++> Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first.
All right, let 's be practical, if Ross isn't willing to do it, he's not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow Chandler-Chandler is good! <+++++> Monica, what is the matter with you?
I can 't let him go out that way, he's got a meeting.  You've got something here on your back. <+++++> What?  That 's great. That is great.  What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there. <+++++> Joey, get out of the fridge.
Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me? <+++++> Well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi ..  no I can't.
Well, I 'm ready to get the hell out of here!  Oh. Are you? Are you?!!  Ohh! That's so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie.  But for you, yay! Ohh. <+++++> Hey!
Hey. <+++++> Well we just wanted to stop by and uh, say goodnight.
I can 't. I'm busy. I'm apartment hunting. <+++++> You 're moving?
Now, do you think it should say,  "Love Ross and Mona?" <+++++> Well, we-we haven 't said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay to say it to other people.
You're right, by saying "nice" I'm virtually licking her. <+++++> Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out?
I thought he was with you. <+++++> He-he was with me umm, we 're playing a little game, y'know? Hide and seek.
That's a two line part. <+++++> Joey, you owe $1100 at I Love Lucite.
Yeah, definitely! <+++++> Okay,  if you 'll excuse me, I-I'm gonna go hang out with some people who don't know the Space Mountain story.
That is wild. <+++++> 
Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife? <+++++> No, I will not!
Ross. <+++++> I don't even wanna hear it, you're just...
All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay. <+++++> Great! Great!  You 're making the bike very happy.
Argh! Why does everything happen to me?! <+++++> Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well.
Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second. <+++++> Great.
Yeah. <+++++> Okay.  Uh, huh. Excuse me, I 'm sorry, I-I think you may be in our seats.
Hey! <+++++> Oh my god...
So you guys go, have a really good time. <+++++> Yeah, I 'm just gonna grab my coat. And uh, and my whip.  Y'know because of the Indiana Jones?  Not-not because I'm-I'm into S&M.  I'm not-I'm not into anything weird. Y'know? Just-just normal sex.  So, I'm gonna grab my coat.
I was not and oh God, shh! <+++++> Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
Hey! <+++++> Emily's cousin kicked me out!
Robert 's coming out. <+++++> What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?
Yeah, like in a cab... <+++++> Save it.
So, he's on the show, he knows what happens. <+++++> Yeah.
YES!! <+++++> Uh fellas,
No, go ahead. <+++++> Thanks.
Oh sure, we should see results -Whoa!! Clearly not the way to go!! <+++++> What?! What?!
What? <+++++> She's not- past, she's present, she's back.
And y 'know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club! <+++++> Divorced men 's club.
Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . . <+++++> C'mon Rachel.
Y'know what? That's okay, you guys have ordered so many that this one is on me! <+++++> Was I talking to her about gas?
Namaste. <+++++> Oh my God! What happened to the door?!
Okay.  Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That 's great! <+++++> Y 'know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that's half human and half pure evil!
I can 't believe you're getting married! <+++++> Yeah.
Yeah, love. It 's a tricky business isn't it? <+++++> I guess so.
Us, what about you guys? Man you really, bing, gave it to old Mr. Clean back there. He was a big guy. <+++++> Yeah he was wasn't he.
Yeah, he's the best. <+++++> Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
well it was awful every time I thought about what you said I started crying. <+++++> So he hasn't called?
Yeah! C'mon! <+++++> Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many! <+++++> Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means...
The lights, please.. <+++++> ...How long was I in there?
Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window. <+++++> Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think?  Two days of darts, it 'll be great!
I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table. <+++++> Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
Can we talk to you for just a y 'know It's just a little thing. Well we think it's absolutely marvelous that you're having this baby out of wedlock, some of our friends are less open-minded. Which is why we've told them all that you're married. <+++++> What?!
What-what's going on?! <+++++> Nothing, nothing. Everything's under control.
No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen. <+++++> What do you mean?
That 's a bad duck!!!  How'd the thing go tonight, Ross? <+++++> Oh, it was, nah, well....
That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me? <+++++> Ok.
Oh no, you're the best. <+++++> Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store!  Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.
To be fair this one does have nuts. <+++++> Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.
Oo, where are the seats? <+++++> Uh, middle balcony.
Dangerous Liaisons. <+++++> Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
Ugh, is she pregnant yet? She doesn 't need to be; she'll still have the baby before I do. Oh Ross, another contraction! <+++++> That 's it. That's it.
Okay. Thank you. That 's great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west 10th? Because there's this really cute shoe store that has like this little <+++++> Okay. Okay. If uh, if you 're gonna do this, then I'm gonna do that.  So
I don 't like you going out with my daughter Ross. <+++++> Okay. I can, I can see that. Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind.
Come on Ross, you 're a paleontologist, dig a little deeper. <+++++> Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn 't invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?
No. <+++++> That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!
So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor. <+++++> That's great!
Oh, look at the little cat! <+++++> What?  Ow!
Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.' <+++++> No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
What do you mean? <+++++> Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?
Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther don 't-don't forget your shirt. <+++++> Hey-hey, what are those?
What'cha gonna' do? <+++++> Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah. Will uh, will this help with the knob getting?
A woman in a man 's body. <+++++> Much better.
Ring dammit, ring! <+++++> Thanks.
This is just occurring to you? <+++++> I always knew I was havin' a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me.
When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is. <+++++> Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
Hey man, what's up? <+++++> Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?
Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh? <+++++> I uhm... Well, I sang...  well actually I rapped... Baby Got Back...
Ahhhh! <+++++> See?
Why don 't you use ours across the hall, 'cause she has problems. <+++++> Oh-ho, whoa! Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled this hot coffee on you.
What? Wha-wha-wha-did you do ROSS! <+++++> oh boy you got mad at that part. I went over there to tell him how great you are but you know me BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, and I ended up telling him that.
No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony. <+++++> Tony?
Three people. Joshua 's not gonna be there. <+++++> What happened?
God we were lame back then. Do you remember how into dinosaurs we were? <+++++> Yeah.
What? <+++++> Are you into crafts at all?
I was not flirting. <+++++> It was totally flirting.  "Somebody got a haircut "
How about we play for more money, say 150? <+++++> 150 dollars.
You need to learn some new slang. <+++++> I'm serious. C'mon, you should go. Here.  No, uh-uh, just go.
Are you sure you wanna do this? <+++++> Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad. <+++++> Aw, he's gonna be so happy.
Are we watchin ' the tape or not?! <+++++> I don 't want people to see it for your sake.
Ice coffee? Tell me it 's ice coffee! <+++++> It 's-it's hot
Even if he were... cornered? <+++++> Well I, I don't know. Why?
Big fat goalie. <+++++> Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movieÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦
Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall. <+++++> And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.
It's us. <+++++> Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together.
Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot. <+++++> Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe, you just said it!
Hey! <+++++> Ohh, it's Joey! I love Joey!
What 's up? <+++++> Well this uh, this may be a little awkward.
Wait! But Ross if they don 't get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends. <+++++> Phoebe, you can 't force kids to be friends.
Yeah. We figured when we couldn 't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh? <+++++> You think?! God, I, ah, I 'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all like, 'I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, 'What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did.
Well let 's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that's plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing! <+++++> So how many more do you have tomorrow?
Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal! <+++++> Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?
Yeah. <+++++> Oh, really!
Hi, is Molly here? <+++++> Yeah, come on in. Molly?
Oh my God. <+++++> Well, Monica keeps changin' the channel.
But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send? <+++++> The small one.
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross. <+++++> Fine.
Oh really!? <+++++> NO!
I believe I read that somewhere! <+++++> That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...  It's not funny!!
What am I gonna do? <+++++> No, no, don't, don't, rub it! Don't!  What gets out hummus?! What gets out hummus?!
Y 'know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue. <+++++> And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!
You are aware that she 's not a monkey, right? <+++++> I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she 's like OLD NEWS!
Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am somewhat comfortable. <+++++> Fine! Fine! Y 'know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You're the mommy.
Well we 'll see! <+++++> Bye-bye!
Ugh! <+++++> What?
Good. <+++++> Yeah, I-I really do.  Hey! This-this was a gift?!
Yeah? <+++++> Don't go.
Done! <+++++> And it can't be Joey.
He said you poked at him with wooden spoons. <+++++> Okay, so it wasn 't uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.
Goodnight <+++++> Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn 't get messed up?
Mon, get out here! <+++++> Monica!
Oh, that is so hot. She walks around him to the other side) <+++++> Hey, I was looking out for you.
Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves. <+++++> Thank you, thanks.  Yeah, I lost it. Y 'know, I'm not gonna play anymore,  would you, can you finish my set?
Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we 've seen each other? <+++++> 1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon 's party. I played you one of my songs, y'know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.
Which time? <+++++> The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn 't realized she was a lesbian.
Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face -And by face I don't mean his lap. And by face, I don't mean my ass. <+++++> Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
I told ya. <+++++> I'm going to the bathroom.
Oh, that 's sweet. <+++++> You 're great. And I-I know someday this will happen for you too. You just hang in there.
Wow, you catch on quick. <+++++> Well, I have a PhD, so...
Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research. <+++++> What kind of research?
Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes. <+++++> Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars?
You speak Dutch?  Zeer vereerd een vriend van mijn moeder te ontmoeten. <+++++> Y 'know I would it's just painful.
Oh yeah. Right. So now, are -do you, do you still do music? <+++++> Sometimes, you should come over  sometime! I 'll play you one of my other
Interesting. <+++++> Yeah.  Anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best.
Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets! <+++++> Uh, yeah! I still can 't believe she hates Pottery Barn!
Well, that's it  You gonna crash on the couch? <+++++> No. No, I gotta go home sometime.
I mean this poor woman. <+++++> What woman?
Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here, come here... <+++++> What's wrong?
Umm let me think...What do I want, what d-o I w-a-n-t... <+++++> Please take your time, it 's an important decision. Not like, say, I know! deciding to marry someone, this is about a muffin.
Well this doesn 't even smell like opium. <+++++> Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
But you are a real boy! <+++++> I know I am!  ...And when it's summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?
What do you like better action or comedy? <+++++> Action.
Hey! <+++++> Hi!
Hey, how come, uhh, Chandler didn't come? <+++++> Well uh, it's cause he had a thing with, wi-, with the thing.
It is starting to get dark out there. <+++++> He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!
Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me? <+++++> Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.
Just a waitress? <+++++> No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?
Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married? <+++++> Yeah?
Hey. <+++++> So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!
Ooh, dude. That 's not gonna happen. <+++++> Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! I 'm the teacher!!
Hello.   It 's Gandolf!!!  So, are you in town?   Oh, well, well maybe next time then. <+++++> What happened?
Oh. <+++++> yeah I really, really need to talk to you about something.
No. No, you're not a loser. <+++++> Look at me!
Well yeah <+++++> Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, I-I-I think she 's cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!
For cam p! <+++++> Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she 's-she's sweet and pretty and
Chandler! <+++++> Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that.
What-what-what are you gonna do? <+++++> I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.
You wanna get out of my face? <+++++> Wait hold on Tony, hold on.
All right I I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question. <+++++> So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I 'm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans. <+++++> Oh, yeah! Right!
I said it's still nap time. <+++++> Hey, there is uncle Joey!
You okay?! <+++++> Yah, because Phoebe knew the mugger!
No! You guys can 't leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned! <+++++> What big thing?
Hey, what's up? <+++++> Uh Mona just dumped me.
Ooh, Ross, look! Look! <+++++> What? Where?
Goodbye Geller. <+++++> Now, hold on! Hold on!  Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I 'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all!  That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight. <+++++> Tough noogies, we're watching Predators of the Serengetti.
 <+++++> Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know.  But, uh... look how happy she is.
All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl. <+++++> You bought Shawn Cassidy!
Uh-huh... right... yeah... <+++++> And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.
I will flip you for it. <+++++> Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!
Fine! We 'll ask Phoebe. <+++++> No-no-no, I-I wanna play.
So, why are you still wearing it? <+++++> Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date?
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. <+++++> Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that- that... that's not why we bought the ticket.
I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free! <+++++> All right.
What is that? <+++++> Well I I told him that if he ever hurt you I would hunt him down and kick his ass!  What?! What?! What is the matter with everybody?! I am serious! I would kick his ass!
What?  What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert?  Why are you laughing?! <+++++> Calm down. There 's no reason to get testy.
Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right? <+++++> Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!
Oh sorry.  And?! <+++++> Well, we-we said we 'd just do it that one time but, but now I think she may wanna start things up again.
Y'know I can 't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!! <+++++> FINE BY ME!!
Never. <+++++> wow, are you still going to move in with him?
I don 't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office. <+++++> Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
oh umm Mike's picking me up for a date. <+++++> oh yea now um how is that going, is it getting serious?
Hum, so, I started to say you something earlier, hum...  There was another reason I realized it was time to end it with Joey. I kind of realized I... was starting to have feelings... for someone else. <+++++> Oh. Can I... can I ask who?
Fine.  Oh no! <+++++> Oh yeah!
Deal! <+++++> What was Monica's nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
But I told you, I didn 't have the time! <+++++> Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don 't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming. <+++++> Oh my god.
Uh-oh, I feel another one coming. <+++++> Sid you lucky deaf bastard.
Well no brush! <+++++> Fine! Y 'know what? It doesn't matter, because, if I remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.
What? <+++++> I 'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you! <+++++> Ahh.
No. <+++++> I 'm telling you, just a little bit at a time.
Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly.. <+++++> Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!
Okay! When?! <+++++> All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
No way! <+++++> The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
Well, I think it 's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months. <+++++> It 's winter, they are fewer people on the street.
Turned out it was a hat. <+++++> Cat!
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! <+++++> Eeaagh!
Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there. <+++++> Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?
Oh, tell her good luck with that. <+++++> Anyone else? Huh? Bring  'em on!
All right. Let 's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me? <+++++> Yes I would.
To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio. <+++++> I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.
Alright fine. I'll do it. <+++++> Good.
I can't believe I never realized this before, I'm in my thirty's and never been in a long-term relationship oh my god  what's wrong with me. <+++++> no, no, no there's nothing wrong with you I mean you don't strike me as the type of person that wants to get married anyway.
Oh-ow! <+++++> All right.
C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a little. . . hard to follow. <+++++> I told you there was going to be sub-titles.
But only if it's a girl. <+++++> Oh, veto. How about-Ooh, I like Ruth! What about Ruth?
No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want <+++++> Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
Yeah. <+++++> Here, go nuts.
So -If you wear that you'll make mine less special. <+++++> Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you- you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.
Scotch. <+++++> Scotch. Alright, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass.
Wow, that 's great Ross, I'm sorry we weren't more supportive before. <+++++> I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone 's all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I'm gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.
Ice chips, just ice chips. They're at the nurses' station. <+++++> I'll get it.
I-I forgot my underwear. <+++++> So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.
Oh yea, your right. It's the second one. <+++++> Really?
Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this? <+++++> No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
Yeah! <+++++> Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors.
Ah. <+++++> Who's laughing now?
I can't believe you caved. <+++++> What?
Hey. <+++++> Hey, how 's it going?
Anything? <+++++> No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn 't heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandler's parents again!
Chandler gets pedicures! <+++++> Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?
Oh my God, you guys have no idea. <+++++> Oh! God! Wow!
Dude! <+++++> Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...
Yeah, it seemed pretty important. <+++++> Oh no.
Oh my God. <+++++> Woah.
Oh, hey, don 't you have to go pick up Emily? <+++++> Yeah.
I 'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel... <+++++> Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel , yeah! About jellyfish and how if you...  Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now. <+++++> Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?
Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women. <+++++> And thank you, for that.
What happened? What happened? <+++++> My marriage is over.
I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class. <+++++> Oh thank you. Thanks very much.  Ow!
He broke that. <+++++> Well, he had gravity boots.
Okay, just sweep it. <+++++> I 'm sweeping...
Well, I think I shouldn't look directly at them. <+++++> Come on, seriously.
I 'm sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman? <+++++> Hey! She didn 't look 50!
Well -Really? I thought Chandler was your best friend. <+++++> Well, Chandler 's my oldest friend, but Joey's my-No! Ah!
Who? Two divorces and Joey?! <+++++> Hey!
That 's it.  Ow!!! <+++++> Oh my God!
Thank you. <+++++> Yes it is too slutty!
You guys are messin' with me, right? <+++++> Yeah.
Welcome home. <+++++> So, how was the honeymoon?
What 'cha readin'? <+++++> The paper.
Hi! <+++++> You made it!
Ooh! How was Kathy 's play? <+++++> Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin ' guy.
Yuh-huh. <+++++> So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
Oooh! <+++++> Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty cool.
Look  it was a lo-o-ong time ago. <+++++> So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even.
Just get out! Now!! <+++++> No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie 's made some new friends. <+++++> Well l-look okay, it 's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want? <+++++> Is that what I want?
All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject.  Call Rachel. <+++++> What 's that on the bottom?
Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better. <+++++> I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.
Oh Ross, thank you. Thank you. <+++++> Do you feel better?
Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform? <+++++> Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.
Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her? <+++++> I did.
I knew. <+++++> You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs! <+++++> I do too! I do too!
Hey guys! <+++++> Hi!
Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... and I... want him to hook up with lots of women!  I just... All I'm saying is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common. <+++++> Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils...
I don 't know. <+++++> That 's what you said last night.
We don 't want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle. <+++++> No. No, y'know you don 't, you don't wear enough of this.  What?
Oh yeah! <+++++> No-no, that 's-that's not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!
Okay come on Phoebe, it 's nothing! Monica, come on! <+++++> Look let 's not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn 't even matter!
Can I get you another glass of wine? <+++++> Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home alone.
Awww, just like his daddy. <+++++> Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean 's office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?
Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy. <+++++> Crazy.
So what movie do you want to see -And not another one I have to read. Okay? I get enough of that from books. <+++++> Books?
All right. <+++++> I want my turkey now!
And I have costumes. <+++++> Oh great! That means I 'm stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there  and you were sittin' right here! Whoa!"
I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys. <+++++> Night.
Please, have some! <+++++> Oh, yumm!
Ok. <+++++> Did the TV wake you?
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there! <+++++> Here she comes. Don 't say a word, okay? Just be cool, don't be y'know you.
C'mon, Ross! <+++++> Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?
She didn't hang up either! <+++++> Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...
Speech! Come on Monica! <+++++> Come on!
Jen. <+++++> Jen, I know this may sound a little  But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or
What is? <+++++> The lie you just told.
Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old. <+++++> Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing. And you know what I did?
So you 've been sittin' around here all mornin'? <+++++> No! I balanced my checkbook.
What?! <+++++> Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the history.
Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough. <+++++> Uh actually, sorry I can 't even make it. I'm seeing Mona again tonight.
You don 't pick me! You 're stuck with me! <+++++> Okay. All right. So let 's see, let's play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we'll kick off.
Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me. <+++++> All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!
Hello, Mark? Hi, it 's Rachel Green.  Oh no, don't you apologize.  Yeah, I'll hold.  He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers. <+++++> That is so made up!
Hey! <+++++> Hey.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Right <+++++> But it absolutely didn 't.  It didn't!! It didn't!!
Oh? <+++++> Ohh.
Really?! Uhh, what color is it? <+++++> What difference does that make?!
WHAT! WHY? <+++++> well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in a serious relationship.
Ross, are you okay? <+++++> Well, yeah, of-of course I 'm okay! What? I'm just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and  what-what is uh, what's this?
He 's great! I mean we have such a good time together! He's so funny, and sooo sweet, and I'm not attracted to him at all!! <+++++> Still?!
I'm not telling. <+++++> Come on, show them to me.
Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed? <+++++> Well, then who was on my bed?
Oh-ooh-ooh! Y 'know what's a good visual aide? <+++++> Please don 't say naked chicks.
Isn't that amazing? <+++++> Oh yeah, no no no...that's great!
That 's a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that! <+++++> No! No I can 't. I mean Rachel's out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.
Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core! <+++++> Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
Well then I think that 's it. <+++++> Well, if he 's angry, he really shouldn't just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.
No, no, no now in all seriousness, its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight, and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out! <+++++> Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...
Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER! <+++++> GIVE ME MY PUCK!!
Oh. <+++++> You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.
You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe. <+++++> Hmm.
Uh, huh.  Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away. <+++++> Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
What?! Why did you do that? <+++++> I don 't know, aheh, your's was the first name that-that popped into my head, I'm I'm sorry. I-I didn't think it would matter.
Here, pass these, will ya.. <+++++> Oh, hey...
I still cannot believe you 're engaged!  Just 'cause its happening so fast; not 'cause you're such a loser. <+++++> Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?
Ross, thank God. <+++++> Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?
Hi you guys. <+++++> Hey.
And um, what-what is that Ross? <+++++> The physical act of love.
I am only one man!  Okay Ross, time is up! <+++++> No, just give me another minute.
Hey! How was it? <+++++> Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand
I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable. <+++++> Okay.
He offered me one. <+++++> You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well! <+++++> Hey, what are you guys doing?
Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing <+++++> No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.
Oh my god. Oh my god.  Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me! <+++++> Rach!
yeah thats a great idea! <+++++> No thanks!
Yeah. <+++++> Yeah, I want my money back.
Yes, I 've done my studying and I really know my stuff. <+++++> All right then.  Rachel Green! Let's play Bamboozled!  How do you test the temperature of the baby's bath water?
Look at it, isn 't it beautiful? <+++++> Yeah, yeah, what is it?
Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is? <+++++> Oh, yeah.
Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? <+++++> Helen Geller? I don't think so.
Will the stable boy never get the princess?? <+++++> What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?
Monica and Rachel's apartment, everyone is watching the tape of the sonogram. <+++++> Well? Isn't that amazing?
That 's all right. Hey you guys, you know what's going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?" <+++++> Great!
Coming. <+++++> I have a bone to pick with you.
Ross, I really don 't think <+++++> Lift!! And slide!
You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day. <+++++> Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
They go on one date and you 're worried about them getting married?! He's not you! <+++++> I just -I-I can't believe she's-she's dating?!
Let's never speak of this. <+++++> You got it.
Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. <+++++> Thank you!
I guess. Why? Who's she with? <+++++> That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.
Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. you're more the fun parent. <+++++> Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.
Man, didn 't she like just get here? <+++++> Yeah!! Yeah!
Me too! <+++++> Listen, I 'm ah, I'm sorry I've been so crazy and jealous and, it's just that I like you a lot, so...
No. <+++++> Okay. Well, you be careful.
Wow. I, I don 't even know what to say. Thank you. <+++++> You 're welcome.
Gimme an  'L!' <+++++> L!
Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad. <+++++> Well, let's just go in there and face them.
Hmm, the game's at one. <+++++> So?
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
And so engaged. <+++++> What?  Oh my God! She- she thinks we 're engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we're engaged?!
So, um, did she... <+++++> Twice.
Yeah! <+++++> Hey!  Well...?
So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes! <+++++> No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
I know, yeah. <+++++> I can't believe Chandler is missing this!
It 's horrible. <+++++> Oh please, can 't I come to your special, magical cabin?
The Hard Rock CafÃÂÃÂ©? <+++++> Yeah!
Blueberry. <+++++> Blueberry it is.
It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date. <+++++> Nuh-uh.
Hi, how's it goin? <+++++> Shh!  Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey!  Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
Three of your five, what? <+++++> Celebrities I 'm allowed to sleep with.
Joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about. <+++++> Yeah.
May I help you? <+++++> Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.
And uh, yeah, I didn 't really, I didn't want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then  to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess. <+++++> So then if-if -I mean if you think about it, this is all  your fault.
Well this is great. Y 'know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, she's really depressed. <+++++> Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?
What? <+++++> And I too am just a love machine.
Sure I would! <+++++> Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!
Yeah, you really shouldn't.  By the way, how was that year-long dig in Cairo? <+++++> It was ok...
Ross, I love you! <+++++> Ohh! Thank you.
You know what? We should call my mum's house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down. <+++++> Oh yeah, it's a good idea!
I know. <+++++> The test is ready.
That 's.... <+++++> That 's what?!
Excuse me?! <+++++> Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, you 've been a little short with me lately. I'm not trying to irritate you.
Good luck to ya! <+++++> Excuse me sir, you've got a little something right here.
And so young. <+++++> Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.
USA Today <+++++> Nice, put it with the others.
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked! <+++++> Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.
No. Uch. <+++++> Oh-oh, wait, my mother is gonna be here any minute. And she has the keys.
I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy. <+++++> Well, umm, why don 't you give him a call?
Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done. <+++++> I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
Always. <+++++> I didn 't get the annulment.
They are awfully boxy... <+++++> I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so... normal.
Monica, I 'm your best friend. <+++++> Sweetie, don 't worry you'll get picked. Chandler.
What?! <+++++> Don 't be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it's too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.
Um-hmm. <+++++> Nice to see you again Dr. Green.
Well then you really don 't need me to live with you. <+++++> Yes! Yes, you 're gonna be so missed.
Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right. <+++++> I do not always have to be -okay, okay.
I wouldn't say never, you know there's that guy  well what about  ok well there's gotta be someone. <+++++> There isn't that's what I'm saying.
Yeah! I 've been working so hard this semester. I really need to go crazy y'know, blow off some steam. <+++++> Sure. Sure. Look I don 't, I don't know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.
You're welcome. <+++++> You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!
Si. <+++++> So you do know a little English.
God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed. <+++++> You don 't have a valid driver 's license-Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
I don 't know. <+++++> Hey Rach!
Oh. <+++++> Are you jealous?
Hey! <+++++> So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about, Ernie 's at 9 o'clock?
Yeah, I don 't think that's what it is. <+++++> Why? What-what else could it be?
I won, hey! <+++++> You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp!  Ah!! That thing gets hot!!
Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do. <+++++> Really girls, not cool.
Okay. <+++++> Okay?
To score the winning touchdown, by the way. <+++++> Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn 't count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.
I really think you need to go now. <+++++> Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn 't work past it together...
Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks. <+++++> An egg?
I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course that you want it. <+++++> Ma, you 're asking me to marry you?
I 'll get her. <+++++> Please hurry.
But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies! <+++++> Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space.
This should be fun. <+++++> No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
You must stop! <+++++> That only took me an hour.
You know, our band is playing on Friday. <+++++> Yeah, yeah. You should come check us out. We're called "Way! No Way!".
Really!? <+++++> Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.
Nothing! <+++++> So what are you gonna do?
What? <+++++> We're not alone.
I mean I love spending time with you, y 'know I just-I hope we're moving forward. I mean, we should probably talk about that. Don't you think? <+++++> Let 's do the card!
Hit me.  Hit me.  Hit me.  Hit me.  Hit me.  Hit me.  Hit me. <+++++> We need more cards.
Really? <+++++> Uh-hmm -Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona.
You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West! <+++++> You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.
Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big?  This is your baby.  Hi Daddy! <+++++> Hello!
Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you. <+++++> I know-
Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy. <+++++> Really.
Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets? <+++++> Do you say this stuff to girls?
Hey! How 's Ben? <+++++> Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said,  "No." I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, "No." I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, "No." So, he's sweeping.
Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout. <+++++> I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn't know you guys had it in ya! <+++++> Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out.
Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody? <+++++> What did you do to my mom?
She said,  "If I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it." <+++++> Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister 's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?  This isn't right.
Oh, it 's crazy about Rachel huh? <+++++> Yeah. She -Well, she's one crazy lady?
I can 't be fair. You're my boyfriend. <+++++> Yeah, but I 'm your brother. We're family. That's the most important thing in the world.
Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island. <+++++> Also an island.
and that was all before 10 o'clock. The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We're not gonna be <+++++> Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily,  honey, okay?
No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no. <+++++> Why 'd you say no?
What 's not funny? <+++++> Practical jokes.
Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers. <+++++> That 's correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when the baby makes this sound?
Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night. <+++++> Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you.
Hi! <+++++> Uh we-we need to talk.
Me too. <+++++> I'm ok.
Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can 't! I can't! I can't! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can't. It's just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can't do it! I can't do it. <+++++> Okay! Okay! Okay! It 's okay.  It's okay. Hey, it's too weird for you, I won't see her again.
I don't know what to say. <+++++> She doesn't know what to say!
Where are we? <+++++> Huh.
No, you 're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love. <+++++> Same difference.
"Dear Rach, you're a great person. Sorry about your tiney-wienie." <+++++> Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasn 't true?!
You what? <+++++> You 've seen it, the Geller Yeller.
I think it could be kind of great! <+++++> Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!
Garfunkle. <+++++> Why are you mad at me?
Well neither do I! <+++++> Is this about Mark?
Ross, a sports car? Wouldn 't it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there? <+++++> That 's not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.
Hey.  Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff? <+++++> Why not? It 's built into the price of the room.
I made that joke up. <+++++> Uh, oh-oh, no you didn 't. I did.
Howdy partner! <+++++> Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides.  I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight.  I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.  I would make a good cowboy.
Hey there Ross! <+++++> Hey!
And I still have about five seconds to spare.  Okay, that was about seven seconds. <+++++> So we're a little late.
You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses? <+++++> But you know what, if you think about it, it actually promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... juicy doubles.
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie? <+++++> There 's this kid in my class who said he's in love with me.
Tuna or egg salad? <+++++> I'll have whatever Christine is having.
Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it 's one of those 801 numbers. Right? <+++++> Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah.
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish. <+++++> Carol, what's the matter? What happened?
No-no-no, don 't-don't do the accent. You've got to see her again. <+++++> And why do you care so much?
You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me. <+++++> I 'm not gonna hit you.
We 're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go! <+++++> When Monica was a little girl, I remember that --Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
I need to talk to you about Charlie. <+++++> Oh, do you, do you really?
It 's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean?  I mean it's like, I-I-I like that you're not involved in that part of my life. <+++++> That 's a little clearer.
What? <+++++> Stupid balls are in the way.
No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one. <+++++> What?
Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I don 't want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it's a terrible thing to even think this, and it's completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day! I'm very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel. <+++++> Okay.
Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3 <+++++> Sorry.
Hi! <+++++> Hey, how was the Met?
Yeah. <+++++> Hey!
Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go! <+++++> Oh, that's right!  Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?
I am  free! <+++++> Great! Because Emily and I are getting married in a month!
I won the game. <+++++> Oh yeah! Then how come you didn 't get the Geller Cup?
Yeah, I just have to get dressed. <+++++> Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes.
1250. <+++++> Damn, I forgot you were here.
It 's laminated! <+++++> Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler  brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.
I don 't know. <+++++> You don 't know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!
But you 're still my friend? <+++++> Not for the next few minutes.
Hey! <+++++> Hi!
That's ridiculous! <+++++> Can I use.. either thumb?
Who jumps at loud noises! <+++++> Wow! I could've died tonight.
At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps <+++++> Who is he?
Hungry monkey. <+++++> Hungry monkey!  Haaa!  I 'd like a Wicked Wango card!
Sweetie, you think you can get in there? <+++++> I don't see why not.
Yeah. Uh,  a slice  six dollars? <+++++> I was thinking more like a hundred.
What are you doing out there? <+++++> I am, uh, I am...
And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know. <+++++> Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.
Ooh! So close. <+++++> Hey everybody!
Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you! <+++++> I could, yeah, I can do that.
Hey. <+++++> It 's a little early to be drinkin'.
Okay. You and me, alright? This is it. <+++++> This is it. Unless we're on a break.
Aww, look at the little thing. <+++++> Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Like what? <+++++> Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
Okay, I'll see you after the thing. <+++++> Okay, good luck
Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe. <+++++> Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another.
Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel? <+++++> Yes.
Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about  'bah- bah-bha-bhan?' <+++++> Well umm, y 'know, I used to play.
I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas. <+++++> You're really not coming back?
Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around. <+++++> What?
You have dinosaur checks? <+++++> Yeah, yeah I mean, you get your money and you learn a little something, what's wrong with that?
Yes we're all in here and we would love for you to join us! <+++++> Well hey! What's going on? Ooh, cool boat--Oh, no.   Hey, did you, did you tell them?
Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back. <+++++> Put it back exactly where you found it?
No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom. <+++++> Yeah, but, but look what I'm...
I'll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars. <+++++> I take it.
Oh, making it worse! <+++++> Okay.
Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened? <+++++> What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.
Oh, hi. <+++++> Hey, what 's going on?
What's that smile? Did something happen with you two? <+++++> Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it!
Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time. <+++++> Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride.
I would love your autograph. <+++++> Uh, uh... Sure! Uhm...  "Dear..."
His legs flail about as if independent of his body! <+++++> Gentlemen, you 're pick.
There we go! <+++++> Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.
Yeah I 'll take that. <+++++> What 's up?
Three tickets to today's Rangers game!! <+++++> Dude, I wanted him to guess.
Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt! <+++++> OK, turn around.  I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous. <+++++> So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.
What happened? <+++++> Who cares, AND?
I can't say, I just thought it was really good and maybe would be worth something some day. <+++++> You really thought "Science Boy" was worth saving!
The country? <+++++> No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?
Sorry Jill. <+++++> Sorry-sorry Jill.
Hi you guys. <+++++> Hey.
I would love to live with you Ross; that 's-that's great! Thank you! <+++++> Well, I 'm-I'm just glad I could, y'know, help you out.
Yeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name? <+++++> Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a good idea. In fact, I think he's dead.
Do I have my own castle? <+++++> Hey! Uh, Phoebe 's not here is she?
So that 's your second marriage in two years. <+++++> Yes, second in two years. Third overall.
You don't want to work for a guy like that. <+++++> Yeah!
Not really. But you are much cuter then that geeky guy she used to date. <+++++> That was me.
Well you, her, I mean, she's very y'know. And you're like y'know. <+++++> Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.
Really? <+++++> Yeah, I'm gonna go after her.
Wish me luck. <+++++> Good luck!
Hi. <+++++> Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.
Isn 't that a kind of sushi? <+++++> No, it 's a concept!
No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it 's time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don't' you think? <+++++> Yes.
Emotional Knapsack? <+++++> Yeah.
It 's a bathing suit? <+++++> To wear in front of people?
I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute. <+++++> Well that I can believe.
I 'm sorry <+++++> Excuse me, what?
Whoa! This looks like an all day job, I 'll have to cancel my yoga class.  Hey Ross! <+++++> Hi.
Okay. Wow. <+++++> Uh Dad, Emma 's in the nursery. I'll take you now. If you want, but  I really want to talk to you.
That's great! <+++++> Excellent!
It 's frightening. <+++++> Well uh, y 'know what? Even if she doesn't know anything, I do! I have a son. And his mother and I didn't live together, and whenever he was with me I took care of him all the time, by myself.
Ross, when 's this comet thing start? <+++++> Well, technically it seven billion years ago
What was the other one Ross? <+++++> Umm, Delilah.
That's what you just said! <+++++> No.
Allright. Well thank you so much for coming... <+++++> Thank you.
Am not! <+++++> You're gonna be an aunt.
Obviously! So, how do we decide? <+++++> Well now let 's-let's look at this objectively, I think I should date her
Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon. <+++++> Okay.
Yeah-yeah, we never had that, <+++++> No.
Well, she has issues. <+++++> Does she.
Yes, but in Ross 's case, they both know in two weeks that 's it. <+++++> Pheebs!
That 's right! I'm not! <+++++> Then where the hell have you been?!
Bye! <+++++> Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?
Oh! How's it going? <+++++> It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!
Oh, God! Please, somebody say something. <+++++> So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?
Calm ourselves? <+++++> No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!
What-what about Monica? <+++++> Oh, she isn 't home.
Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you. <+++++> Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.
Really? <+++++> Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I 've decided to accept the fact that you're going out with her. <+++++> Really? That okay, that 's great.
What?! <+++++> He left that.
Yeah honey, I 'm standing right there! Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet. <+++++> Excellent!
Seriously? You divorce-o? <+++++> If you have to call me name, I prefer  "Ross the Divorcer". It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry.
Why don 't you look in the mirror, scrud. <+++++> I don 't have too. I can just look at you.
Okay! <+++++> Hi?
Okay, Dave in the membership office, handles quitters.  Uh, excuse me,  are you a member? <+++++> Me? No.
Wanna peek? <+++++> No!
Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore. <+++++> So I guess we 're back to uh, Baby Girl.
Oh. <+++++> Wait, wait, wait.
I kissed Kathy. <+++++> What?
Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy. <+++++> Oh, but-but it is, uh, it 's just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
Why don 't you open with a joke? <+++++> Open with a joke? It 's a university, not a comedy club!
Okay. So, which boxes are mine? <+++++> Well, these. These are yours right here.
But you did! I mean, let 's be honest. <+++++> Yes let 's. Y'know what? Uh, it's-it's not important. What is important is that, is that we're having a baby. And it's not-Doesn't matter who came on to who.
G'bye, Nana. <+++++> Bye, Nana.
Really? You think so? <+++++> I was talking to myself! You 're going down!
So? <+++++> So I don 't wanna be just anybody.
Oh yeah! <+++++> Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out.  We will, we will, call you back!
And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and  whoa-whoa- whoa, sh-she's naked! <+++++> Hi.
Ugh. Wait, wait, wait. <+++++> What?
I 'm gonna get back to retraining. <+++++> All right, see you guys.
Hey, what do you want to drink? <+++++> Who 's that?
Shut the door! Shut the door!! <+++++> What 's-what's going on?
This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller. <+++++> It-it 's great to meet you Paul.
Well Monica just told me that they don 't. <+++++> Yeah, they don 't like you.
Ow! Ow! <+++++> Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?
Excuse me.  You should check this out, tell the other tenants. Apparently he's running around looking for some kind of a hot girl. <+++++> Who isn't?
It 's Joshua. <+++++> Oh, whatever.
Whoa! <+++++> Wow, hello! You look great!
Ohh, it 's a bit small. <+++++> Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
Don't you want to know about the sex? <+++++> The sex?  Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya , yaw...
That was amazing. I can't even send back soup. <+++++> Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
How is it going with Charlie? <+++++> Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.
Hi. <+++++> Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency.
Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero. <+++++> Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. I'll get the information. <+++++> No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know what's going on.
Oh. <+++++> Oh.
What's the matter Ross? <+++++> Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon. <+++++> Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn 't actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
Hello, people who do not live here. <+++++> Hi! Hello!
Oh my God! Ross!!! <+++++> Hello!!
Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice. <+++++> Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are
Oh, What's the matter? <+++++> She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.
Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so <+++++> Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it.  Okay Rach,  that's you. That's the couch.
Hey. They're just trying to decide somehting. <+++++> Good, good, good. So, is uh, was your moustache, did, used to be different?
Let's do this alright. <+++++> Woah, ho-ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon?
Oh well, we don 't because we got the other pl-place. <+++++> How rude.
Humiliating and noble! <+++++> You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising.
You cuddled. <+++++> Yeah, which was nice.
What? <+++++> It's not bad.
Ross. <+++++> Oh, forget it, okay?
...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there. <+++++> We 're just gonna be friends.
Ugh. <+++++> Hey guys.
I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant. <+++++> Oh, that's not cool.
Shh! It is a family name! <+++++> Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?
Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it? <+++++> No.
Well let 's just say its she's lucky she has a sweet ass, 'cause she's not so good at the writing. <+++++> I can 't believe in four weeks they're gonna be married!
What? <+++++> You're livin' the dream.
I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so... <+++++> I'm sorry... we... we can't.
Well, it's a little low... pick up a little...  a little bit more...  a little bit more...  There you go!  Now throw it away! <+++++> C'mon! This looks good!
Well don't just say. <+++++> Ya know, maybe, maybe I should just go.
Just get out of here, okay? <+++++> What's - what's going on?
Okay, is this lamp in the same place? <+++++> Who cares? I repel women.
All right, I 'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you but you were so mad already! <+++++> Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it 's not funny!
Oh.  Thank you. <+++++> That 's no problem.
Well, I was thinking that it 'd probably be okay because Ross hasn't gone out with Rachel in five years! <+++++> Joey, I 'm not worried about her! I'm worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this  actor taking them?
What 's up, Ross? <+++++> So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?
Here you go. <+++++> Oh.
I 'm sorry, who are you? <+++++> I 'm a professor here uh, Ross Geller.
PHOE-BE. <+++++> Why does she keep making that noise?
What have you got there? <+++++> Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
What?! <+++++> She wants me to move to London.
Joshua. <+++++> Joshua guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kinda y'know.
Hey! I 'm an  actor too! I'm not sure. I think they're taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island. <+++++> A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!
The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it!  You always have to think about the trail! <+++++> Oh, I-I don 't think there's any trail.
What? <+++++> Can I ask you somethin'?
You know what 's really good here, the lobster. What do you say shall I just order three. <+++++> Yeah, if you 're really hungry.  It was a joke, I made a joke.
Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! It was really wonderful! Did you just make that up? <+++++> No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. It 's how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.
I could 've been killed I hope you know! <+++++> I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe!
No, but ah, there 's coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night. <+++++> Mon?
Mint! <+++++> She's gone.
Just okay -Did you do it right?! <+++++> Look, it 's just did, did you ever go to a party and think, "Would really anyone miss me if I weren 't here?"
Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...? <+++++> If you want to check your email, just ask!
I appreciate this soo much, I've been trying to go out with this guy for like a month. <+++++> I-I-I...
Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other. <+++++> Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again.
Really? <+++++> Yeah. Uh, uh we promised we weren 't gonna tell anybody this but uh, about a month ago Rachel and I slept together.
I miss you to. Well, at least I think I do. <+++++> She's talking.
So are we friends again? <+++++> Yeah.
Okay, I need a, I need a drink! <+++++> Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff.  But who cares?! Because it's all on me!   That is, one big drink!
Oh my God! <+++++> What?
What's the matter? <+++++> Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...
Okay. <+++++> You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round begins -stop it -now. What was Monica's nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Oh my God! <+++++> I had a problem.
That was such a fun night! <+++++> Yeah. It would 've been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, till death parts us. <+++++> As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily.
Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair? <+++++> Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
Tho? <+++++> Ohhh.
No, hey, it's been great. <+++++> Yeah?
What are you doing here! <+++++> We're late too!
Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth! <+++++> Space is filled with orbiting children.  Look, please, just come on, you know, when you 'll see the look on Emma's face, I swear you won't regret it.
Hit me, hit me. <+++++> No!
My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt. <+++++> The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it 's time to light the Hanukkah candles!
Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature? <+++++> Some days it's all I can think about.
Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was. <+++++> Her date tipped me ten dollars.
Where have you been? <+++++> Long story, honey.
Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I 'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that... <+++++> No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I 'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore.
So you're gonna move? <+++++> Oh my God.
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad? <+++++> Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
Uh... What can I do for you? <+++++> Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.
Mary-Angela. <+++++> Mary-Angela.
Oh I see, so this suit is making a point. <+++++> Right.
Well what if somebody steals something? How are you gonna run after him with one leg shorter than the other?! <+++++> Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?
that she was the huge guy that mugged you? Yah. <+++++> I see. You didn't happen to tell
Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her. <+++++> Fine.
Well, why do you call him Gandolf? <+++++> Gandolf the wizard.  Hello! Didn 't you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
I respectfully disagree. <+++++> I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so I hope you're hungry. <+++++> Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you. <+++++> But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?
What, he 's 18. <+++++> Exactly, it 'll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.
Plus hotels are fun! My room has this little fridge full of free snacks! <+++++> Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...
Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving? <+++++> No, they're not.
You know you kissed me first. <+++++> What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me signals all over the place!
Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife. <+++++> It could happen.
Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night? <+++++> Oh yeah, I 'd love that.
Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS. <+++++> That's worse than no food.
Hey, are you okay? <+++++> My wife 's a lesbian.
Ohhh!! <+++++> Nope! Something else.
Sure. <+++++> Okay.   I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay?
On the touchy. <+++++> And that 's not against your oath?!
Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom? <+++++> I thought that was just a rumour.
That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging! <+++++> It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!
Ohh, you 're a freak!! <+++++> Perhaps. Now I 'm curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?
Oh my God. <+++++> Okay, it 's not, it's not.
Oh, yeah go ahead. <+++++> Uh, before we do uh, are any of Joey 's special romance magazines in there?
So don 't think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as a a two month anniversary present. <+++++> Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance!
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl? <+++++> It 's a girl! Anyway, it wou-it wouldn't matter. Okay? Because I'm a teacher and she 's a student.
Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too! <+++++> Ok, cut! Great. That was... that was just... yeah!
Oh. <+++++> What? Are you going back to work?
Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out. <+++++> All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.
I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy? <+++++> Uh, Eddie something. He just met him.
Oh no-no-no-no, no! <+++++> that you actually
I hate you!! <+++++> And, I love you!!
Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!! <+++++> Look, I 'm sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don 't want to be divorced three times.
Oh, so did I. <+++++> No tongue.
Yeah. <+++++> Yeah?
Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities. <+++++> It's the only possibility, Phoebe.
Melinda! <+++++> All right.
Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing. <+++++> I, I know it's big, I just didn't know it was uh, ha-ha big.
Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people. <+++++> Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
Come here  Oh! There she is! Hi! <+++++> What?
Well, that ' me.  Here, have this.  I'm only allowed one piece of carryon anyway. <+++++> Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm, I 've been thinking, I'm just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.
I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy! <+++++> I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Oh, was I doing it again? <+++++> Yes!
Were you this cute in high school? <+++++> Oh stop.
Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground. <+++++> Be-caaauuuse...
You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband. <+++++> What?  So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
Wait. Really?!  'Cause mine get me out of tickets. <+++++> Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It 's been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.
Maybe this wasn't your shot. <+++++> Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud? <+++++> I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.
OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair. <+++++> See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said.
Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me. <+++++> I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok? <+++++> Ok.
My husband. <+++++> Ooooohhh.
I 'm thinking, I'm gonna order a pizza. <+++++> Order a pizza like,  'I forgive you?'
Oh yeah! Actually, that 's one of the reasons why we're not a couple. <+++++> I chose those, I 'm a paleontologist.
I can't believe you did this. <+++++> Chandler-
Yes? <+++++> King?
Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so... <+++++> Why don't you use your Thesaurus?
Listen also we 're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over. <+++++> Oh yeah!
Sure, nice. <+++++> Dude. You're married to my sister.
No Santa? Was I bad? <+++++> No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.
What kind of an emergency? <+++++> Well let there -what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, "You ride this bike or I'll sh I'll shoot you."
Look at that! <+++++> So, um... where did Paolo come from?
I don 't know. I guess the other people just don't care enough. <+++++> Hey! It 's starting to snow.
I-I am Kristen. <+++++> Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area,  'cause if you are I'd love to show you around sometime.
Fine, it's fine...  I'll just shower by myself... <+++++> B, B, B, B, B!
But we're fine. <+++++> Absolutely.  So, twins... hah! That's like two births.  Ouch.
We came over as soon as we saw. <+++++> How could you not tell us?
Don 't be too long. <+++++> Okey-dokey!
Hey. <+++++> So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn 't a mistake. Ahh, there's-there's limited seating in the hall.
I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!!  You are surprisingly strong! <+++++> I need juice! People need juice!!
Ooor... <+++++> Get out!
Dancing on your feet! Like the other girls did it. <+++++> Okay.  Hop on Gert.
Phonetically? <+++++> Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time for this.
No-no-no-no, no, it 's a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can't we savor the precious moments?  Those are some huge breasts you have. <+++++> Hi.
Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo. <+++++> A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that?
No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence. <+++++> How, how, um how can you not be going?
What? <+++++> Is everything okay?
Good luck to you. <+++++> Mind if I mute?
Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay! <+++++> It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.
Okay, we 're not. <+++++> Right.
But my apartment is so... <+++++> Well then a small one!! Listen, let 's, we kinda have to get going!
Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding. <+++++> What?
Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn 't even be an actor! <+++++> Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn 't go well but it really did go well?
What?! <+++++> Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!
Well, I've never gone this fast before. <+++++> Phoebe, forget it, okay? Newark is - is like an hour away. There's no way we're gonna make it in time.
Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows? <+++++> No, I, I only know Lipson.
Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and Rachel? <+++++> Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room.
Is it an engagement ring? <+++++> Yes!
Oh that. <+++++> Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They 're mean and they're stupid and-and I don't want my son learning them!
Can I see that for second. <+++++> Yeah.
You know, you're a really great listener. Most guys I go out with, they just talk and talk. <+++++> Mm-Hmm.
She 's moving on! Okay, if it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else! And unless you're thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It 's over. <+++++> Yeah, okay.
No, no, no! <+++++> But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?
Yeah. <+++++> Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.
So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable?  Yeah, sounds about right. <+++++> Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.
So Ross, what your problem? <+++++> Eh-wh -Excuse me?
Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we're really good friends. <+++++> So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh is he still in love with her?
Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere? <+++++> I'm smarter than him!
I got it! Scotch tape. <+++++> How did you know she would buy scotch tape?
All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work! <+++++> How do you know? You don't have a watch.
You know what? There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win. <+++++> Me too. So much for my dinosaur/Amelia Earhart theme park.
I knew it! Because you love Rachel. <+++++> It 's not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I
Ross, that is gorgeous! <+++++> Yeah?
Hi! <+++++> I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what, she- she happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um, whole head shaving idea, and now, who was it? Oh, that 's right, that's right, it was you!
Uh, Rach? <+++++> Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.
Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I 'll go under, you go over! <+++++> Yeah, I 'll get right on that.
Nothing. <+++++> Hi!  What... . Please tell me those are clip-ons.
Oh God, I am so sorry honey... <+++++> Oh, so sorry man! Sorry!
Do you have any respect for your body? <+++++> Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
How's it going? <+++++> Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.
Hey! <+++++> Hey, Missy...
Huh? So whaddya think? Casa de Joey. Huh? I decorated it myself. <+++++> Get out.
It is going to be okay!  It was worth a shot. <+++++> Hey!
Santa's mad at me. <+++++> No, hey-hey, come on,  Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!
All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally. <+++++> It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!
Hot? <+++++> Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!
Fine. <+++++> Fine.
Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?! <+++++> Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!
Course there, they just call it food. <+++++> Yeah... I guess. I don't -I don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK?
Still on Amelia Earhart? <+++++> The woman just vanished!
Ohhh <+++++> Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.
Let's show 'em. <+++++> Uh, just a sec dad.
I can 't figure out what to make Monica. <+++++> Oh, why don 't you make her one of your little jokes.
Phoebe's Mike? <+++++> Yeah.
Ross, what are you doing?! <+++++> Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.
What 's your problem? <+++++> Nothing, it 's just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
What happened to the library? <+++++> There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one.
How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you? <+++++> I don't know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy!
Okay, I 'll see you in a bit. <+++++> Okay, have fun! Wooo!!
Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem? <+++++> No, not a problem.
Okay fine, I did. But I didn't see anything, I swear. <+++++> Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!
Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks. <+++++> Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.
Hi! <+++++> Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
Losers walk! <+++++> Yeah, losers talk!
Yeah, someplace nice.  How much do you think I can get for my kidney? <+++++> I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
Hello. <+++++> Hey.
Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second.  Whup, okay.  Hello! Vegas? Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? We would like some more beers. Hello? Ohh, I forgot to dial! <+++++> That must be our alcohol and beers!
Hey. Ooh Ross! How 'd the conversation go? <+++++> Oh great, I live on the street.
 <+++++> 
Come on look guys, don't fight. <+++++> And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
All right! Bring it on, you <+++++> Here we go.  Y 'know, I've-I've never played my stuff for anyone before, so it's important that-that you understand it's about communicating very private emotions.  Y'know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That's what I'm
Take it like a man, Ross! <+++++> No!  No!
What?! What? What happened?! <+++++> Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?
I'll see you tomorrow. <+++++> Okay!   Hey!
Yeah, we 're gonna go. <+++++> Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
Why not? <+++++> Because you sent away the dog!
After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help. <+++++> Yeah, like I could lose it.
Monica! Come on! <+++++> Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I?
To Ross! <+++++> Ross!
Nice hair. What 'd ya do? Swim here? <+++++> Okay, that 's it, I can't take it anymore.
Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit. <+++++> Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...
Umm, I 'm talking about that which you already know but won't admit. You love her again; you re-love her! <+++++> Look, I do not re-love her.
Yeah. I 'm sorry. <+++++> I just, I don 't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?
Check this out. Can I have this? <+++++> How can you not believe in evolution?
You're right. We'll go with the burgundy. <+++++> Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out.
Oh... Bye guys. <+++++> Oh my God!
Mm-hmmm <+++++> Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?
I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just... <+++++> Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal.
Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us. <+++++> Oh, you and me?
Ah.  Oh. <+++++> Hey. We-we look we look pretty good.
Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one. <+++++> Ok...
Shh!  Of course, why don 't we go inside? <+++++> Oh-ooh!
I'm just not going. <+++++> Your not going.
Come on! <+++++> Heavy thing, not getting lighter!
Yeah. <+++++> The one that always stares at me when I come in?
I realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people, but I really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is take care of a child. <+++++> Okay.
Just don't. Look at this funky shirt! <+++++> Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.
C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously. <+++++> Dad, you really don't want to do that.
Really...? Guys do that...? That's... weird... <+++++> Thank you!
There you go! Someone came! <+++++> Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!
Huh. <+++++> Hey -Ooh! What's-what's that, dinner stuff? You making dinner?
Uh, well... Joey and I broke up. <+++++> Oh my God, wh-what happened?
Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain. <+++++> So Joey, you okay?
Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he 's gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can't.  But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it. <+++++> No-no-no-no-no.
Hello? <+++++> Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?
Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? <+++++> You are way off, pal.
Well That 's y'know-That's-We've been alone for the last twenty minutes we're doing okay. Besides y'know what? I-I-Maybe we won't be alone, 'cause lately I-I-things have been happening between me and Ross, y'know? Right before I went into labor, we-we had this kiss. Y'know? So it might be the the beginning of something. <+++++> Hey Janice!
Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper? <+++++> It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize.
They're waiting for me, Ross. I can't do this right now, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. <+++++> Rachel?
Because we hate them. <+++++> Come on that 's not fair! I mean you haven't even heard me play!
No, it starts with a silent  "M". <+++++> Oh come on!!
Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don 't know what the big deal is! <+++++> The big deal is I don 't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle-beer! Cold beer.
No, no, it's not, don't listen to him!  I'm gonna thump you! <+++++> It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.
" Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease  " Darn it! Now, I don't know who to get to the next verse. <+++++> Oh, you could just go uh,  " greatest of ease  BAH-bah-bha-bhannn. " Then go right into it.
Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there. <+++++> Hold on.
No. No, I haven 't seen him. <+++++> Oh damn!
Yeah. <+++++> Oh my God, we did it!
Good!  'Cause I've got a product report to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I don't fall asleep. <+++++> Why? Did you write it?
What do you mean, comforted her? <+++++> It 's nothing, I just gave her a hug.
How exciting! <+++++> Yeah! I know! It was. Oh the only sad thing is I wasn't around when it happened for the first time.
Ross thanks. <+++++> You want me to call her right now?
Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I 'm always the hostess. <+++++> Hey!
Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right? <+++++> That-that-that 's all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I'll be right out here.  She's just fixing her makeup.
Was it really that good? <+++++> We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it 's almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?
Ross umm, there 's something that I've got to tell you, there's-there's someone else. <+++++> Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
That 's less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was. <+++++> So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera.
I don 't know. They-they must be your mother's, but please, please don't ask her. I'll throw these away. <+++++> Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad,  Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym  Oooh, my rock polisher!
I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's first words . <+++++> Yes you did, gleba is a word!
Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine? <+++++> Yeah. You, uh, you want some?
I came to talk to you about Howard. <+++++> Howard?
Well, I 've tried everything. I give up. I guess I'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe.  Kids love that right. <+++++> Aww, Pheeb, come on isn 't there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?
Hey! <+++++> Hey! What 's up?
Oh yeah. <+++++> Yeah.
Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I 'm not drinking on this date tonight. "Umm, I'm a recovering alcoholic. I'm a Mormon," or "I got so hammered last night I'm still a little drunk?" <+++++> Hey!
Hey! That 's just poking me in the eye! <+++++> Sorry, I 'm sorry. Close, close, close...
I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show! <+++++> Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher?
You could drink the fat. <+++++> Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.
Come on, you made coffee! <+++++> C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...
Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool. <+++++> Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best.
Ooy. <+++++> And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is life without love?
Pick me!! <+++++> No! Pick me! I don 't want to end up an old maid!
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside! <+++++> Hey, Pheebs.
Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for. <+++++> Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that? <+++++> You got ink on your lip.
You guys wanna get some coffee? <+++++> Yeah.
Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines. <+++++> Nu-uh!
My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake. <+++++> Hi!
It-it's really heavy. <+++++> I got it.   So hi, I 'm uh, I'm Ross and this is my friend Chandler.
Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's. <+++++> Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
Ooh, very official. <+++++> Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer.
Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say. <+++++> Look Rach I-I 'm sorry, okay? I I was a stupid kid, okay? The only reason I joined
Now, don 't argue with me <+++++> Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you guys.
Hi guys! <+++++> Hey, Pheebs! Hi!
Congratulations! <+++++> You too! What are the odds?
Geez Ross, you could have showered. <+++++> It's the dog.
All right, sorry. <+++++> I gotta go make a fake Ben.
Couldn 't I just say, "This is Ross?" <+++++> Sure, do whatever you want.
Morning, Ross. <+++++> I'm getting married, to..day!!
Wonderwoman! <+++++> Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone   when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says
Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This is why Adam Carter wouldn 't go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region! <+++++> Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one 's not really our fault.
I'll get it.  Hello.  Hi Emily!  Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second. <+++++> Hey!  Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner.  Uh, yeah, sure uh hold on.  She wants to say hi.  Hold on.
Oh. What's a lurker? <+++++> Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits for you to give up and then
Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house. <+++++> Absolutely.
All right girls, and man. Let 's see your final tallies.  Ohhhh, Debbie,  321 boxes of cookies,  Very nice. <+++++> Not nice enough.
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK. <+++++> What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
Oh my god, are we supposed to answer? <+++++> O is for "oh, wow!" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.
Um, hum. <+++++> We're good.
No. <+++++> What do you mean "no"? I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay.
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that "Woo-hoo" thing. <+++++> Hey!
Oh, uh, again. Can I make a special request <+++++> Hey, hi, hi!
You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do? <+++++> What?
Why should we? <+++++> Because it's a special hat.
Hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment? <+++++> Oh, yeah, no problems. It 's all taken care of.
14? <+++++> No, 19.
That's what I hear, yeah. <+++++> This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?
Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is not the number for  this store, 038 is Atlanta. And I... <+++++> Pepper?
Ross, you don 't have to yell. <+++++> There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired.
It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today. <+++++> I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.
You want to see her again, right? <+++++> Sure.
You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn! <+++++> Nah.
You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on you! <+++++> Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
It 's my joke. <+++++> It's my joke.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there. <+++++> Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? 'Cause if are please, tell me what it is I did!
Really? <+++++> You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie.  Was there a second of all?
Why? Is he? He is! Isn 't he? He's dating that slut in marketing! <+++++> Maybe I should open a divorced men 's club.
Which... which... which... Which one is it? <+++++> OH! SON OF A BITCH!
Doorknob? <+++++> Yeah, it kinda grows on you.  Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.
You just give him a spoon baby! <+++++> Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!
No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya! <+++++> Hey!
Wow, uh, anything else I should know? <+++++> Nope, nope, that's it.
Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day? <+++++> Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.
Wow! Thanks! <+++++> You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!
Oh. Thanks. <+++++> You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
You picked a great couch. <+++++> Yeah?
Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one! <+++++> Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!
You. Like you haven 't done enough. <+++++> Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do. I mean I wish I were a seahorse.  Because with seahorses it 's the male, they carry the babies. And then also umm, I'd be far away in the sea.
Oh thank you. Hey y 'know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth. <+++++> Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we 'd be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn't meant to be.
Fauna. <+++++> Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?
I'm sorry, it's not here. <+++++> Not there.
You stink! <+++++> Are you kidding?!
Not so much. <+++++> Hey, y 'know what and if you're looking for a place? I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.
Hi honey! <+++++> Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone?
Yeah! <+++++> After one class? I don 't think so.
Okay! You take care! <+++++> Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?
All right! Ross, do you think it 's easy for me to see you with somebody else? <+++++> Y'know, hey! You 're the one who ended it, remember?
Honey, it 's not pushy, he gave her his home number. <+++++> What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn 't that sad?  God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be? <+++++> I know what you mean, I 've always wondered how different my life would be if-if I'd never gotten divorced.
Thanks man. <+++++> Joey, had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
All right, well I guess I 'll just have to do what I do on dates. <+++++> So let 's decide on the spending limit
Thank you. <+++++> Hi Gunther.
No, ten o'clock. <+++++> What?
I did the first time! Oh. Oh..  <gets up and walks into the kitchen> And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving Emily to you. <+++++> Emma.
No! That would be so awkward! Look -Besides, we work in different departments. He's on the sixth floor y'know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. What's the big deal? It could be worse, it's not like he's calling me Muriel. <+++++> Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel?  Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? It 's not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!!
Yeah. <+++++> And have you .. ed?
Let it go, Ross. <+++++> Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
Wait, you 're giving me your Porsche , you're kidding me right?! <+++++> Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
It's nothing. <+++++> Hey, hey, it's me. Why can't you tell me?
What?! <+++++> Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
What did you do on yours? <+++++> I went to Egypt with my dad.
Ross! <+++++> What? What?
Look, if you did... <+++++> Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want.
I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again. <+++++> Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin.
Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming. <+++++> Wow.
How do you know about this? <+++++> My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance -karate lessons.
Of course I do. <+++++> Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.
Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it. <+++++> No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?
You got two more twos? <+++++> I'm an eight!
Ow! <+++++> Look...
Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don 't take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez. <+++++> Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I 'm gonna be out with her all night.
You broke a little girl 's leg?!! <+++++> I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
That hot girl from their wedding? <+++++> Yeah.
What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way. <+++++> Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it.
When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out. <+++++> That cup is mine!
Me too! <+++++> Here  So this was fun!
Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules? <+++++> I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.
Yeah! <+++++> Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
What is in the cup?! <+++++> Okay, it 's coffee.
At least I care about his feelings! <+++++> What?!
So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that 's nice! <+++++> Yeah, right!
Hey! <+++++> Hi!
 <+++++> Uh actually Joey, it 's the Cretasous period.
Well, somebody got some last night. <+++++> Twice.
Ross, ten o'clock. <+++++> Is it? Feels like two.
What? <+++++> Get out of the cab!
Oh, because I was thinking, the semester's over; you're not my teacher anymore. <+++++> What time?
Oh yeah. <+++++> I'll make some calls.
Hello?! I still don 't know what the hell I'm doing! <+++++> Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way. You 'll-you're gonna pick it up.  Hey! You will! Uh look, y'know when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddy's credit card. Do you remember?
So, rocks. <+++++> I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.
Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who! <+++++> Yeah? Sometimes it's
So what are you saying? It 's now or never? <+++++> No. I 'm saying it's now.
Weee!!! <+++++> Yes!! Yes!!!
Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That just means it's working. <+++++> Women really want this?
Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before? <+++++> We uh, we just cooked it up.
Animals dressed as humans. <+++++> That 's correct. Ladies?
Are those your teeth?? <+++++> Ohh, you can see them, huh?
Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do? <+++++> What?
Why don 't you fill out this address card. <+++++> Oh, okay.
Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan. <+++++> Is there somebody else?
No-no-no! No, no, no, we 're not married. <+++++> We are having a baby together, but we 're not involved.  I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while ago, but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night.  Or, yes stranger, we'd like this delivered please.
Yeah you are!! <+++++> Ahh, whoo-hoo!!(He runs back out the door.
No! <+++++> I knew it. So, is she someone from work?
It 's pretty, Okay date of birth? <+++++> You know my birthday.
Uh, put your elbow in it. <+++++> Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?
What 's in the cup, Ross? <+++++> Umm
The burping clogs? <+++++> Linen closet.
Don 't say that I have no sentiment!  This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed!  This is from the museum from the first time we were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter! <+++++> I don 't know what to say, I'm sorry. Though, you're not supposed to take these.  It's like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
Man, I gotta get a kid. <+++++> Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?
Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so <+++++> So listen uh, I know you and I haven 't really had a chance to talk since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were.
Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he 's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry. <+++++> I think it means he freaked out and left!
Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time. <+++++> This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole  "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?
Ok! <+++++> I'm dead and no one cares?
 <+++++> 
That is a slap in the face. <+++++> Forget it. I-I -Y'know what? I'll just have the conversation. I'll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best. What do you think Rach?
Gimme a  'Y!' <+++++> Y!
Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds. <+++++> God, do you realize in ten years we 're gonna be 40?
Are you trying to get everybody divorced? <+++++> You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You...you break the
Hey! <+++++> Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
But Ross, you want the name Ruth! <+++++> Not like this!
And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date? <+++++> Hey, if that 's what you want to do I'm not gonna say no.
And now for the great news. <+++++> What, that wasn 't the great news?
I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed. <+++++> No, she was definitely on my bed.
Oh, well, actually. <+++++> 
I want to take my tongue... and... <+++++> ....and....
Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it! <+++++> Nooo!
What? <+++++> Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.
Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink. <+++++> You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.
Oh hi! <+++++> Who 's this little guy?
Mine was a humdinger <+++++> O-kay... I mean, don't I deserve anything? I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug?  NOT FROM YOU!
Really? You two? <+++++> Yeah! Rach?
Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup. <+++++> Well, I'm off to Carol's.
But, we 'll stay here with you. <+++++> Thanks guys!  I really appreciate this, y 'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.
Ross! Wait! <+++++> Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about
And we're done with the chicken fried rice. <+++++> Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!
Uhh, the ball thing. <+++++> Yeah?
Hey! <+++++> All right, here 's the ring.
No-no, that 's not, that's not me Phoebe, that 's her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F.  Best Friends Forever. <+++++> Oh!
Make love? What are you a girl? <+++++> Always a great way to get in a man 's pants.
THE HELL I DO! <+++++> I don't get a goodbye?
Well that -y'know it's just uh, I've never done that before. Me and him alone. <+++++> Rach, he 's not an ex-con.
She is? <+++++> Yeah, you didn 't expect her to live there with a baby did you?
Y 'know, there's two women dude. <+++++> Show me where?
Hi Ross! <+++++> Hi roomie!
Okay, well g 'night. <+++++> Good night.
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You 're my hero! <+++++> Hero, I uh, I don 't know-well, all right.
Oh I don 't-I don't know. <+++++> Man, look at all those stars!  Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesn 't it?
Okay, but I get to hop on after her. <+++++> I am so gonna score.
Oh. <+++++> Umm say, I-I opened this earlier  but let me give you guys some privacy.
I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me. <+++++> Fine, then why didn't you say something?
Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat. <+++++> I'm pretty sure that it is...
Hi! <+++++> Is uh, is Monica here?
Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles. <+++++> Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
I think we 're here. <+++++> Oh! Yeah.
This game is kinda fun. <+++++> You don 't think it's a little crazy that you get all my points just 'cause you
Yeah. <+++++> So you took off my pants and shoes?
Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming.  What? <+++++> I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
Christmas eve. <+++++> Yes, but also  Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
What? <+++++> You're nose is bleeding!
Nooo!   Hello?  Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much.  Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really. <+++++> Green. To the green.
Baby. Ross. <+++++> Dr. Green. How are you?
Yeah, we are. <+++++> No, we 're not!!
I can do it, okay? Come on, let 's go. <+++++> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie. <+++++> Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!
No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts! <+++++> Good! That 's good!
See, there's always one guy.   "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes." <+++++> Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.
Oh I don 't know honey. It's gonna be really late. <+++++> Oh come on, not again.
Your license please. <+++++> You don 't-you don't want to hear about my dream Officer Pretty?
Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin ' it by the park. <+++++> Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?
Thanks. <+++++> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now! <+++++> I really wish that you wouldn 't.
Noooo!!!! <+++++> Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!
Talk to me. <+++++> OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did!  See what happens when you break the code? <+++++> Joey-
Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while. <+++++> Just ah just put roommate.
I heard that! <+++++> Well, I said it loud.
They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit. <+++++> Right, they are scary.  Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
Of course we 'll help! Yeah! We'll be here! <+++++> Thanks!
Ross. <+++++> Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?
What? <+++++> It's what you want. You should go.
No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think? <+++++> What?
Yeah, they 're fine. <+++++> Yeah?
And the antennae Oh my God you're Spudnik! <+++++> Yes!
And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening. <+++++> Ohh. . . Thanks Rach, goodnight.
Hey, it's me. Here's Ross. <+++++> What? Hey, hey, listen..
I think face to face. <+++++> I would say that.
Does so count! <+++++> Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.
Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game. <+++++> Oh my god.
What?! <+++++> I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in  Actually, thanks!
You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste. <+++++> ...I hate waste.
Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking? <+++++> You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.
What is wrong now?! <+++++> This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then
Okidoki!  Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny. <+++++> Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews  And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with.
Hi, sure! <+++++> Hi.
Frankie? What're you talking about? <+++++> Hey, what's goin' on?
Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen. <+++++> I'm sorry, I was an idiot.
Alright, just put your hands out and I'll back up into them. <+++++> That's romantic.
Why? <+++++> Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
Okay! Okay wait! You listen to me! You listen to me! Since I have been waiting four women, that 's four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies! I'm next! It's my turn! It's only fair! And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I'm going to sue you! Not this hospital, I'm going to sue you! And my husband  he's a lawyer! <+++++> Uh Rach
Hey. <+++++> Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air
The doctor. <+++++> Is everything okay?
Wait. Are you talking about the Dewar grant? <+++++> Yeah. Why?
Umm Wow, all right.  Wow! Yay! Ooh, I 'm gonna meet a guy! And really soon! And he's gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night. <+++++> Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? It 's a button down, like a, like a faded salmon?
They 're not!! Ross, they're just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?! <+++++> Well then we 'd be in a lot of trouble, you don't know where any countries are.  Okay.  Uh, say would you umm Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have  opened up?
I know. <+++++> Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.
That's right. But if you don't want to know <+++++> No, no, we want to wait, right?
I am shocked! Shocked!! <+++++> It 's a legitimate learning technique.  Wow!
Just aim for the bump. <+++++> Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I 'm not even sure I got it. <+++++> What, you didn 't get it? The doctor is a monkey.
Big bullies!! <+++++> Ow! Ow! Oh, no-no-no!
Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures? <+++++> Ah, we 're out. I sold them all.
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth. <+++++> You got me a cola drink?
Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you? <+++++> What?! Look, we 're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
Here, I got five, I got five. <+++++> Thank you.
So you eh, you talked to Joey? <+++++> Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.
Can I get you some water? <+++++> I 'm good. I'm good.
Oh okay, I 'll fix that to. What's her e-mail address? <+++++> Rachel!
What... What... <+++++> Okay, okay, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two, right?
Nothing -Why?! <+++++> Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
Hi! <+++++> Hey! So what's the big news you had us rush all the way over here for?
Hi everyone. <+++++> And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
Is it okay if I finish the apple juice? <+++++> Is that Mark?
Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left? <+++++> Why does everyone keep saying that?
Oh, hey... <+++++> "A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet." -- How did you know?
Get your hands out of there! No! <+++++> Let me see! Show them!
No, no, ACC-cept that. <+++++> Oh.
Yeah. <+++++> Yeah, what, what was I thinking?
What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie. <+++++> Pop it in.
Y 'know that's really fair. Y'know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I'll show you! Come here. <+++++> What?! Why?
Hey, have you guys seen Monica? <+++++> Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.
Really? <+++++> Yeah.
Hey man, what's up? <+++++> Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow.
Yeah, okay, bye. <+++++> So I 'm gonna take off then!
Hey look-look, Phoebe 's talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy. <+++++> Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.
Mark's a genius! <+++++> Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
That she 's gonna move in with you and maybe then she'll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you're already married, she'll just be happy. Y'know? You're just, you're very sad. <+++++> Oh my God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!
I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing  "Happy Birthday". Then we would all go into... HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!!  They have to learn! <+++++> Hey!
Yes! <+++++> What thing?
Give her a key to your apartment. <+++++> Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.
Great. <+++++> In-in three minutes.
Hi! <+++++> I'm gonna get some more coffee.
I 'm gonna need a copy of those. <+++++> Totally.
What? <+++++> Doorknob! Doorknob!
Hi! <+++++> Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out.
What are you guys talking about? <+++++> Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
Uh.  Did you call your parents? <+++++> Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.
Or? <+++++> There 's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
Ohh! Me too! <+++++> Is-isn 't it the best?
You can 't wear that! I'm wearing the famous tux! James Bond's tux! <+++++> So?
Just some stuff for the party. <+++++> Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?
Oh, Ross <+++++> No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?
Hey. <+++++> Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK?
No. I don't think so. <+++++> Okay. Um is he a good guy?
What? What 's going on? <+++++> Monica 's pregnant!
That was a great lecture today. Did you get a little hair cut? <+++++> Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to know that I 'm changing your grade back.
Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh,  I'm still in love with you Ross. <+++++> Wow. Umm Huh I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
Wait a minute. What about that summer during college that you lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer? <+++++> Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up?
Holy mother of God!!! <+++++> With my child.
I don 't know, Monica picked out the flowers. <+++++> What about the chairs?
Oh Daddy, no he didn 't mean anything by that, he really didn't. <+++++> Nothing I do means anything, really.
Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan. <+++++> Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!
Why don't you just get a roommate? <+++++> Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe-  ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.
Hi, Ross. <+++++> Hey.
What's goin' on? <+++++> Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
What line? <+++++> Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh,   "Dude, don't you ever was your face?"
That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing. <+++++> Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people.
I just don't want to be alone tonight. <+++++> Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or... Oh, oh. . No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea.
Oh, hey! <+++++> Hey! You were so right!
I think it would make me wanna marry you even more. <+++++> I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!
Co-founded! <+++++> co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love with you. Obviously I didn't handle it very well. But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.
Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might  end up hurting. <+++++> Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily.  My God, think of the massacre.
Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late! <+++++> For what?
The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts! <+++++> Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?
I 'll just run to the store and get some. <+++++> Oh no! Hey-hey, I 'm the guy! I'll get it.
What? What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? Have you never chased anyone through the airport before? <+++++> Not since my cop-show got cancelled.
Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one. <+++++> Yeah, see, I don 't think it's gonna that difficult considering this one won 't be taking place in the basement of a Pizza Hut.
See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in! <+++++> You chipped in?!
Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it?  Oh forget it!  Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village. <+++++> Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I didn 't even watch it! Anyway, here.  I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself.
Ben just said hi. <+++++> What, the word hi?
Don 't worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent's strength and weight against him. <+++++> Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.
And was the curse lifted? <+++++> Anyway. That 's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.
Well, whaddya think? <+++++> Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
Woo-hoo, stuud! <+++++> What's she look like?
Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7. <+++++> Okay,  this play, I want you to do a down and out to the right. Okay. Break!
Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this... <+++++> I swear to God...!
Tell it to the Time Turtle! <+++++> Shut up! I Dream of Genie!
Oh, you know what? I'll come with you! <+++++> Ok.
All right, well I just wanted to say thank you though for diverting Kyle 's ex. <+++++> Oh yeah -No-You're welcome. We'll talk about it later.
I think it's winning. <+++++> I think it's insane.
Oh, it 's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong? <+++++> My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.
I cannot believe you didn 't pick me. <+++++> Uh, in her defense, she 's right. I am stronger. I would destroy you.
No. She 's going to live with us for eight weeks. <+++++> Uh, what?
Sorry. <+++++> That's ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!
Let's see, today's Monday... Never. <+++++> Oh, come on! Come on!
Yeah? <+++++> Oh my God. I mean
So, is this just gonna be you and Carol? <+++++> No, Susan's gonna be there too. We've got dads, we've got lesbians, the whole parenting team.
Come on, touch it! <+++++> Okay.  You can feel all the bones in your skull.
The ones we had right after you almost threw up. <+++++> Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16.  I 'm okay.
All right, but in the future... <+++++> Okay!! Okay!!
You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go? <+++++> Oh fine.
You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?! <+++++> Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit.
Ross, hey, the band 's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so <+++++> Oh! Oh-oh, the band 's ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says-I don't care about the stupid band!!
All right, it won't come off! <+++++> What?!
Yeah. <+++++> Yeah.
Do it! <+++++> Monica!
He 's getting married tomorrow right? <+++++> Yes. Yes. Don 't worry. Everything's fine. We'll uh, we'll see you tomorrow at the wedding.
Hey you guys... You're never gonna believe it. This headhunter called me. I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci. Gucci wants me. <+++++> I'm up for tenure.
No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe 's our friend! Well, I'm not gonna watch it! <+++++> Yeah! Good for you Joe!
I .can 't .believe this! <+++++> And yet somehow it 's true!
Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!!  That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back. <+++++> No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.
Uch. <+++++> Really, it would be good for you and in fact, why don't you, why don't you go ahead to the restaurant and I will wait for my mom and then I'll meet you there.
I was not flirting. <+++++> And on your anniversary, for shame!
Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty. <+++++> The eyes did still sparkle.
Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods. <+++++> That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.
Let me see what you wrote about yourself <+++++> You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat.
Uh, Dana Keystone from college. <+++++> Oh yeah! Wasn 't she uh
Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream! <+++++> Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
Nah, I don't really want her to see. <+++++> Why not?
Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song! <+++++> Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.
Okay, I guess it doesn 't seem that weird. <+++++> Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven 't gotten it.
Yeah, we haven't dropped it in <+++++> 2 hours, 27 minutes.
Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys. <+++++> Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?
Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this? <+++++> Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is
You're on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay? <+++++> Okay.
Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? <+++++> You know what I like most about him, though?
I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together. <+++++> Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you  'til you cried?  We're probably too old to do that now.
No awareness. <+++++> We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?
He 's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago. <+++++> Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
She 's in the bathroom. <+++++> Rach, we gotta go.
If you hold a spider. <+++++> WHAT? WHERE? WHERE?
Okay. <+++++> So, I 'll umm...
Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is. <+++++> Probably shouldn 't touch me.
Ohh... Oh! You were not meant to see me before the wedding. It's bad luck. <+++++> You know what, I think we've had all the bad luck we're going to have.
Wow! <+++++> Here it comes.
Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you. <+++++> You've had feelings for me?
So what are you gonna do? <+++++> I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease? <+++++> Who needs a lease when it's family!
Dude! <+++++> I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!
That's what I'm saying. <+++++> Phoebe? Phoebe?
Hold on! There is something different. <+++++> I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
OK. <+++++> But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him? <+++++> I don 't know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.
Alright, who do you want as your emergency contact? <+++++> Ah, Rachel I guess.
Uhh, hang in there? <+++++> Oh, no, I didn 't mean, uh
Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o 'clock position. <+++++> Maybe it 's uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more!
Wow, it was so -wow! <+++++> Really?! I mean, really?!!
Ohh!  Hi! <+++++> Hi!
I said art lover. <+++++> Is that supposed to be an insult?
Sure! <+++++> Yeah? Hop on.  Is the pretty lady looking?
Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial? <+++++> Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
Like she 's really mean, and she's over critical, and-and-No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you! <+++++> Okay.
Hey! He beat ya. <+++++> She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? <+++++> Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.
So, what is this information worth to you, my friend? <+++++> Are you trying to get me to bribe you?
The Hospital, Mr. and Mrs. Geller are there, along with Aunt Lillian. Ross and Monica enter and everyone says hi and kisses.) <+++++> So, uh, how's she doing?
Hey. <+++++> Hey.
Hi. <+++++> Where's Rach?
You don 't know? <+++++> Know what -If somebody doesn't tell me what's going on right now
She went on one of those spray-on tan places. <+++++> Eh, you got a spray-on tan?
What is he doing here?! <+++++> He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I 'm stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I've got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.
Where ya going? <+++++> Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.
Did you not get a good enough look the other day? <+++++> Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.
Yeah, Ross is here so... <+++++> Yeah, and I was really hoping that I could hang out. What do you feel like doing?
Yes. They're insanely white. <+++++> I-I, did that for you.
Why not? <+++++> No I don 't.
Well, didn 't you just hear what I said?! <+++++> Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex- husband 's gonna say that stuff. Now, if you'll excuse me
Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it! <+++++> Yeah, Susan.
There 's just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don't know if you'd understand. <+++++> Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
Break up with Charlie! <+++++> What?
I can 't believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York. <+++++> No, it 's really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.
Hi! <+++++> Hey!
That was good beer. <+++++> Ohh
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much? <+++++> Come on, it's fun!
Oh, let me see! <+++++>

Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face...  ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks. <+++++> Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?
Yep, pretty much. <+++++> You-you 're gonna get married?! I mean We're gonna be brothers-in- law!
Maybe you need to spice things up a little. <+++++> What-what do you mean?
What is that? <+++++> Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.

Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars. <+++++> Hey.
It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone. <+++++> Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?
Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp. <+++++> I got it.
Who wants French toast? <+++++> Oh, I 'll have some!
Who's Paul? <+++++> Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?
Ohhhh. <+++++> Thirty seconds, all the questions you can answer.

I'm not blowing her off, I actually just got off the phone with her, were going out tomorrow night, I mean I hope that's ok with you stranger from the coffee house. <+++++> well then I didn't need to bother you or the four other Mike Hanagens I bothered.
Oh, thank you! <+++++> So five of us is, $33.50 apiece.
Right. <+++++> Okay. You know that I-I have to go.
Well, isn't, isn't that gonna be weird? <+++++> No, no.  I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I'm pretty comfortable with the whole situation.
Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out. <+++++> I did not freak out.
Yaaaay! <+++++> Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.
Okay! So, we 'll just stay married. <+++++> Yes, exactly!
The sexy blonde behind the counter. <+++++> Gunther?!
He hates me. My nephew hates me. <+++++> Come on, don't do this.
Shhhh!!! <+++++> Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's. <+++++> Okay.
Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you? <+++++> It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?
Until then, General Grant, why don 't you set up camp  right there. <+++++> Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor 's appointment.
I think I'm gonna take off. <+++++> Huh?
Wow! So, how are you? <+++++> I'm, I'm okay.
A little bit more. <+++++> Give me the bag.
That's what I was doing too. <+++++> Well, you have fun tonight.
Not the other one? <+++++> No, she kept kicking me away!
Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers! It must be a good review! Is it great?! <+++++> Umm
Thank you so much! <+++++> Yeah, oh and Sarah... I'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, Professor Wheeler, a-and this is Joey Tribbiani.
So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. . . <+++++> Oh, no no, I am.
You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?! <+++++> Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils?
Got a job on a river boat? <+++++> Y'know what I didn 't wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You're not my girlfriend anymore so...
So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things? <+++++> You like that do ya?
He is! But he 's getting divorced-Ross! Maybe you know him. <+++++> It 's not a club.
No, come on Ross!  Look, Ross, we have to get past this. <+++++> Give me the bag.
Emma's awake. <+++++> Yeah?
Are they? I didn't know I cared that much. <+++++> Hello.
Oh dear God! <+++++> But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.
Ugh, okay Sherlock! <+++++> Look, I 'm sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs.
The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have. <+++++> No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?
Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic. <+++++> Toilet paper?
I can't believe this is happening. <+++++> You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.
I'm sorry guys, closed set. <+++++> Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together.
Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me? <+++++> How 'bout from now on we just call it the 'unfortunate incident'?
Yeah Ross it 's okay, it's me, Mr. Stevens. <+++++> Oh! Oh my God! I didn 't even see you!
Yeah. <+++++> Sweetie that 's it.
You don 't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria. <+++++> Who is Maria?
Oh wow, I don 't feel well. <+++++> I 'm telling you. I'm telling you. That's what it is. No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn't say anything to you?
Naked? <+++++> Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.
Stop it! <+++++> No! No! It 's wrong! It's-it's-it's naughty. It's taboo.
This is like figure skating team all over again.  I mean synchronized swimming.  I mean- I mean the balance beam.  Help me! <+++++> FOOTBALL!
I really can't say. <+++++> So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?
Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time. <+++++> The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.
Ooh! I know what you could make!  I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff?  You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know. <+++++> Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
Oh! Sorry! Umm, I actually do need to talk to you. <+++++> Oh, okay. What-what about?
I do Raquel. <+++++> So, uh, he's back.
Yes! <+++++> Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.
Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later? <+++++> Uh sure, sure.
This totally makes sense! <+++++> It does not!
I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions. <+++++> I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now, Joe!
Oh-oh, absolutely! <+++++> It 's just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around.
That makes more sense. <+++++> So, what's going on now?
What did we just finish talking about Ben?! <+++++> All right, that 's it!  Come-you-no! You are in big trouble young man!
Okay, you guys free tonight? <+++++> Yeah!!
I 'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow! <+++++> I 'm gonna call after you!
What is it? <+++++> I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it.
You feel that too? Oh, I thought that was just me! <+++++> Are you kidding?
No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It 's a very big deal, there's a lot of people there I have to meet. <+++++> And I 'm sure you're gonna make a big impression. Hi! I'm Rachel Green. It's nice to meet you.  Come on, you probably have a broken rib!
If it helps, I could slide over. <+++++> It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
I do, I believe you. <+++++> You do Pheebs?
All right, I 'll see you guys. <+++++> Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Okay fine! Fine! We 'll just have to think of some other way to put the whole 'Who came onto who,' thing to rest! Come on now, think!! <+++++> Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? It 's Rachel's tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.
Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit. <+++++> Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say? <+++++> Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl 's bodies, waking up next to people you don't even know
Can I go next? <+++++> What? Of course you can! Hop on!
Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny 's funeral in here. <+++++> Come on, come on, we 're-we're-we're lighting the candles!
Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?! <+++++> Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
Oh honey, but it is just about <+++++> It is! It is!
There are a couple of forms to fill out. <+++++> Easy.
Hey, what do you want to drink? <+++++> Who 's that?
Did you do it on our invitations?! <+++++> Not on the ones we sent out.
Three. <+++++> Just three?! I 'm dilated three!
I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go.  Mark, I need you! <+++++> Okay, bye-bye.
Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band. <+++++> Ross.
Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking- <+++++> Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
Oh my God! <+++++> I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven 't done that since I was four and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.
Does anybody need more coffee? <+++++> Yeah, I 'll take some.
Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school? <+++++> No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .
You got married again. <+++++> Yes.
Yeah, I guess. I-I I mean, do-do you think we 're ever gonna have that? <+++++> You mean, we -you and me?
No-no, it 's really not huge. <+++++> And; people thinking it 's huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.  Which we are not!
Oh! <+++++> The actress!
Let's ditch him! <+++++> What?
I don 't care! You just get him! <+++++> I 'm gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!
Nice save. <+++++> Mrs. Bing.
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this? <+++++> Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice
OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch. <+++++> Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it 's like enough! <+++++> Well, I tell you what. Why don 't we uh, why don't we just stay here? Let's not see a movie, we'll just hang.
Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us! <+++++> Chandler!!! Chandler!!!  Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
This is your place? <+++++> Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing.
That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you. <+++++> Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?
I did. Now I'm the idiot. <+++++> Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!
Yeah? Well, you should know. You 've bought like a billion of 'em. <+++++> Yeah, you didn 't get one.
What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of person that works at a library. <+++++> It 's not a library...
Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die! <+++++> Respectfully, professor R. Geller.  Hey!
Ross has a boyfriend. <+++++> I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There 's a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.
Oh my God!! <+++++> So you two are really serious?!
No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it. <+++++> Forget it, she 's destroying it.
All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos! <+++++> You got it! . All right, she's right, we gotta get serious.  Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!
Julie. <+++++> Ohh.  Hi!
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again? <+++++> Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
Hi Monica! <+++++> Hey Mon!
Ross? <+++++> I'm here.
Okay but if you don 't find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass! <+++++> I will, I will find him.
Oh, come on squeeze it. <+++++> No.
Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?! <+++++> Got me.
So. Ross, I 've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change. <+++++> You really serve people sneezers?
Oh, I don't mean to be a square, but I'd really appreciate it if you wait and drink your wine after the kids are asleep? Oh uh, thanks for this, I hope I can do the same for you sometime. <+++++> Who wants to make some long distance calls?
What did they do? <+++++> Well, they painted over the word  'Sapien' for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let's just leave it at that.
Yeah, but uh, I don 't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf. <+++++> Yeah, me too.
Really? <+++++> I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second? <+++++> Yeah.
Never mind. But it was going to be really good. <+++++> What's going on?
Hi! <+++++> Hi!
Yeah, but you didn 't. <+++++> No, but it 's-it's-it's hot!
Ben, dinner! <+++++> Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.
Okay, bye! <+++++> Oh no.
And you know Monica and Ross! <+++++> Hi Jill.
Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to decide what messages I should or should not get? <+++++> Who am I?
And y'know what, I 'm gonna, I'm gonna go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, I'm gonna stop by around 8 <+++++> Okay.
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert. <+++++> What?! What is with everybody? It 's Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!
Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie. <+++++> What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco.
All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with. <+++++> Those are the pacts!
Well, you tell a lot of jokes! <+++++> Look, Chandler, it 's my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don't print the name, so it doesn't really matter who gets credit, right?
Sure. <+++++> You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK. <+++++> What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear.  What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants? <+++++> Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?
Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it 's just Jason's so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it's just better than having just like a really, really, really nice  butt.   Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck! <+++++> Good luck!
Of course not, because you 're in love with her. <+++++> I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn 't tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend.
I 'll call you later. Bye Ross. <+++++> What-what-what the -how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
Wow, that's great! So, tell me about the grant! <+++++> Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the  "Paleontology Review"! Yeah! That'll be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious questions about my work!
No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times. <+++++> Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie? <+++++> Hmm? Oh, yeah.
No. No. <+++++> Okay! All clear!
Okay.  Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe <+++++> You were backpacking across Western Europe?
Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives? <+++++> Y 'know what? I-I-I I-I have had enough of this! Y'know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you've got a problem with me, frankly
Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just..  Here we go.  Looking good Gellers! <+++++> We know!
No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody. <+++++> Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?
So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out. <+++++> Because , it's weird!
Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today? <+++++> Yes it is. See.
Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We 're the same, you and me. <+++++> Actually, no, we 're not.
I 'm serious. <+++++> Okay look, there 's nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time. There's a great baby furniture store on west 10th. Tomorrow, we will go there and we will get you everything that you need. Okay?
Yeah, well, I gotta work, I 'm sorry. <+++++> Why-why can 't you take a couple of days off?
Pheebs come on! Bunny vs. Doody! We 're waiting!   Okay. Okay guys, one match, winner take all.  Oh wait-wait! What does the winner get? <+++++> Pride.
Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him? <+++++> My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
Yes. <+++++> Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I 'm sorry.
The guys across the hall are throwing water balloons at us. <+++++> Oh, you have to call the police! That 's what I did to the kids in my building!
Oh my God, this is so cool! <+++++> Ok, odd thing to get excited about!
Yeah, she 's been out there for twenty minutes, I'm surprised you didn't hear her on the way over. <+++++> Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling,  "I'm gay! I'm gay!" Can I bring her in?
Okay, but it's Valentine's Day! <+++++> I know.
What? <+++++> Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.
Oh-ho! <+++++> Sorry.
Ross, how many parents have you lost? <+++++> None.
Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture? <+++++> I 'm sorry, I've got plans with my sister.
Sure  who are you? <+++++> I'm Ross, Phoebe's friend from the coffeehouse.
What?! <+++++> I won 't date. I'll uh, I'll be here, with you, all the time.
I know. <+++++> I love this.
Hey. <+++++> You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.
Well, I would love to but the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects. <+++++> Phoebe.
It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon!  She's-she's gonna kill me. <+++++> Yeah, the phone was facing the other way.  And that goes back up there.
Ross, Joey is not here. <+++++> Okay, I 'll just wait for him in here!
You had to do it, didn 't you? You couldn't just leave it alone. <+++++> Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there 's a bug in my food.
Is your tongue swelling up? <+++++> Either that or my mouth is getting smaller.
Well let 's just hope it works. Y'know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce? <+++++> Phoebe that 's not true.
Thanks! <+++++> Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma.
EH, what do you know! <+++++> You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.
Already?! <+++++> Yeah, but it didn 't fit. Well, luckily there's a store here that has one left in her size, but I'm the groom, I'm not supposed to see the dress
Yeah? <+++++> The bathroom?
You 're Spudnik. <+++++> Come on, who are we kidding? I 'm doody. Please? She's watchin'.
I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures. <+++++> Oh, right, because he's a scientist!
Doesn 't he? <+++++> Hey, wanna wanna a little cheering up?
That's nice. <+++++> No, no, with him.  I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.
You go get that animal outta here. <+++++> No, no you don't understand the animal hospital is way across town he's choking I don't know what else to do.
Listen, Robert 's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him? <+++++> Oh.
You kids ready? <+++++> Thanks again, Dr. Green.
Oh my God! <+++++> See? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. I've met him before?
Of course there 's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love! <+++++> I 'm not proving anything. Okay, I'm done listening to you. If I hadn't let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would've put my fist through the wall!
May I have the rings?  Emily, place this ring on Ross 's finger as a symbol of your bond everlasting.  Ross, place this ring in Emily's hand as a symbol of the love that encircles you forever. <+++++> Happy too.
Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica... <+++++> That money is mine, Green!
At a fake game!! <+++++> Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I 'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.
Hi. <+++++> Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?
Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable. <+++++> It hurts my teeth.
She said that?! <+++++> Yeah.
No, I don 't think we'll be doing that. <+++++> We 're not gonna do that.
Oh, don 't worry I have plenty of sun block, it's SPF-30. <+++++> Well, if what 's in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it's-it's get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it's just milk.
Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how 's it, how's it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together? <+++++> Oh yeah, yeah we 're moving forward. You'll be getting our card!
Okay. <+++++> I don 't know what to say.
Ooh, I like those sunglasses. <+++++> Like  'em, like 'em? Or, I'd like to get store credit for that amount like 'em?
Congratulations! I didn 't want to say anything in front of Joey 'cause I didn't know if he knew yet. <+++++> What, that we had a baby? Come on let 's give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.
I don 't need a tissue! I'm fine-d! <+++++> When you put a  'D' at the end of 'Fine' you're not fine.
You are so just doing this out of spite. <+++++> Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!
I 'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place. <+++++> How sad are we?
Ross, why do you hate our child? <+++++> Fine, you go.
Well, Ross and I were in grad school together. <+++++> But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker. <+++++> No, no!
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk? <+++++> Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players. <+++++> I can 't believe he didn't come!
My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey. <+++++> Way to go, Phoebe!
No,  'cause she didn't tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I've only got a week left, y'know? I've really gotta start living now! , leans back, and starts reading.) <+++++> Hey everyone!
You 're a genius, Ross. <+++++> Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?
Oh, she 's so tiny.  Where'd she go? <+++++> Oh it 's okay. They're just-they're just wrapping her up.
Why didn't I get that message? <+++++> What?
You have chalk on your face. <+++++> Huh?
Taffy, really? I've never had any. <+++++> Ever?!
Diet soda. <+++++> Yes. Yes. Yes.
Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they 're probably not even listening! <+++++> They 're not listening too me?
All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg. <+++++> You got it.
He 's got a girlfriend! <+++++> I can 't believe someone would do that for a grade.
Well, we've gotta go. <+++++> Ok.
Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison. <+++++> Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay, clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?
You blew them away! <+++++> Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean... uh, did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me?
Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me! <+++++> Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
What?! You can't -what did you tell her? <+++++> I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision?  I'm actually asking you!
Honey, cover it up with the boat! <+++++> Hello?
Roll playing You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench! <+++++> Okay, I think I got it.
Ross, I know what you 're thinking. <+++++> What?
You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it. <+++++> Hey, you guys... I have great news.
Are you going to eat that bread? <+++++> Ohh, I just like the smell.  Mmmm.
Well-well, I don 't know Ross-really? <+++++> Yeah, yeah, it 'll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?
Well, that 's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba. <+++++> All right, look, look, you 've got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like,  "Ooh, where'd Ross go?" <+++++> Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac
He's open! <+++++> Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
Ross? <+++++> Hey Chandler.  Monica!
Storming out! <+++++> Rachel, this is your apartment.
You were really gonna do that, weren't you? <+++++> Well, yeah.
We should start with the big stuff. Y 'know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch.  I got it. <+++++> Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
Oh, Ross, I 'm sorry. I completely ruined your evening. <+++++> Yeah.
Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You 're probably just gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate. You're gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And she's gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud. <+++++> I am a good kisser.
Hmm mmmhm.. <+++++> We are even, right?
Yeah, right. <+++++> Aaawwwwww!!
Well, I really wanted to meet you guys, but I have to run. I 'll see you later? <+++++> Okay!
Hey. <+++++> Hey.
Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best. <+++++> Hey, you ok?
O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that... <+++++> That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!
Well, it is overdue. <+++++> Look, don 't worry. Okay? You're gonna be fine.
Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once! <+++++> Okay, okay, what's going on?
No-no, I don 't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?! <+++++> Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain. <+++++> 
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you. <+++++> Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
I'll see you later. <+++++> Okay!
What? <+++++> Chandler 's gonna ask Monica to marry him!
Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it! <+++++> I know!  Don't switch hands, okay?
Who is it? <+++++> It's me. Ron.  Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back.
Wh -You dated my sister! <+++++> That was different!
What?! Why?! <+++++> Because! Because, it-it-it 's It'd be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don 't ride it you-you're-you're killing its spirit!  The bike is dying.
I love both of you! <+++++> Yeah?
Yeah! Yeah. I 'll be all right. <+++++> Y 'know what would cheer you up?
Ooh, I've been better... <+++++> Come here.  Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
I 'm fine, but that's not important. What's important is how was she? <+++++> Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee.
Oh come on Ross!! <+++++> No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, I 'm sure we won't get arrested for this.
Ohh! That 's so sweet of you! Oh yum!  Did you put pickles on this? <+++++> Well yeah!
Oh so-so not really never. <+++++> I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we 've been through, I just-y'know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
What party? <+++++> It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.
Wait, this is important! Can Ella wait? <+++++> Ehm... Her name is Emma.
Not fun anymore? <+++++> I'm still hungry!
So, should we tell her? <+++++> I don't know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up. <+++++> That bad?
Boys? We're going in. <+++++> .....Hi.
Sorry, prom queen. <+++++> You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.
Well, can 't you tell her that you are not in the mood? <+++++> No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn 't work either, I can't tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...
Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- <+++++> Why- why are you here, Carol?
There's a forest right outside. <+++++> It's not the same.
Why can 't I find that? <+++++> Don 't ask me, I had it and I blew it!
Well, I 'm sure you get another one at Ann Taylor 's. <+++++> That 's my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!
Here 's what's gonna happen. The music's gonna start, you're gonna dance, we're gonna tape, you don't look at the camera. Any questions? <+++++> Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?
Let 's do it! Ross? <+++++> What?
Hey -ooh so, how was Vermont? <+++++> Emily is incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it, I mean the whole weekend was like a dream.  Oh! And you! Rach!
Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view? <+++++> Well I don 't know, but how-how great would that be huh? You living in my building. I could help take care of the baby. I can come over whenever I want.  With your permission.
Ok, unless you're not gonna try to get me to join a cult are you? <+++++> No
Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks <+++++> Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
Cool! <+++++> Yeah!
What the hell are you doing?! <+++++> Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's   "Audition didn't go so well.  Yeah it did?" <+++++> Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!
Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much. <+++++> Yes!! I knew it!!  Bye-bye! So long! Later!
But do you wanna get back together? <+++++> I don't know. It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right. When I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go. You know what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together.
Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis. <+++++> Yeah, but I got cous-cous!
I was shrieking... like a Marine. <+++++> All right here. Watch me execute the three  'P's of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache.
You could kick anyone 's ass you want too. <+++++> Thanks you guys.
You obviously haven 't screwed over a lot of your friends.  Which we all appreciate. <+++++> No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would 've just stepped aside.
They do! <+++++> No they don 't!!!  Well they should put it in huge black letters!!!!
Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her. <+++++> I don't know what... you're talking about.
Come on! <+++++> I can 't believe this!!
Duh!! Christmas! <+++++> Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch.  Okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail isn't going around any more.  What time is it? It's 7
Hey Ross. What's up bro? <+++++> What the hell are doing?!!
Oh. <+++++> I know if you were getting married I 'd feel, kinda .. y'know.
Eww! <+++++> Well, what happened?
Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment! <+++++> Of course he is! What, do you think I 'd just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
For what it 's worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more. <+++++> I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can 't date. It's against the rules. It's forbidden.
Ross, it's too hard. <+++++> No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.
Here's your warm milk. <+++++> I'm going to uh I'm going to, um, put the bourbon in it at home.
A card! A card! I pick a card! <+++++> Oh, I 'm sorry you've been Bamboozled! You're gonna be a terrible mother!  I've lost sight of why we're doing this!
I'll pull you through. <+++++> Okay.
Very cool. <+++++> Hey Pheebs, you know I'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the other day and I hope I was a little helpful.
I 'm right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there's no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means! <+++++> All right, let 's not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.
Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight? <+++++> Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.
Ross I -We tried all the spicy food. It's not working. <+++++> Okay here, have one of these peppers. Oh ha Oh God! So so hot!  Oh my- By the way, you don't want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye.
And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again? <+++++> Yeah!!!
Remember when we were in high school together? <+++++> Yeah.
Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God! <+++++> Excuse me.
Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way. All right, I'll see you guys later. <+++++> Bye, Richard.
Ohh, uh-huh so much! <+++++> Pheebs you uh you do know how to ride a bike don't you?
That's a great story-can I eat it? <+++++> And then Rachel wasn't sure she could leave the baby.
What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh? <+++++> Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it 's a sickness really.
It wasn 't my ring! It's Ross's ring! That's why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose. <+++++> What?!
I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before. <+++++> Well, start looking.
Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now! <+++++> Oh my God!
But like how? <+++++> Well we-we don 't know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this.  Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that's uh, that's all for today.  Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?
Night. <+++++> Ok, good night!
Hey. <+++++> Hey.
It 's the baby's buttock, she's breech. <+++++> Oh thank God, I thought she had two heads.
Why?! <+++++> On account of my rage.
What does that mean? <+++++> Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I 'm not invited to sleep-overs.
Okay, then you don 't know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I'm wrong, who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive. <+++++> I 'm sorry.
Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name. <+++++> No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?
So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know. <+++++> I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?
That 's all right. <+++++> That 's okay.
What?! <+++++> Monday?!
Ross, you can 't tell her not to go. You just started dating. <+++++> Then what am I supposed to do?
What are you doing?! Get in the front! <+++++> In the death seat?!!
Hey! We 're here! <+++++> Hey!
Yeah! <+++++> And somebody took a shot at me!
Hi. Sorry, things aren 't working out so well. <+++++> Oh no! It could be better, but it 's gonna be okay, right?
Yeah, I definitely. I don 't like the name Ross. <+++++> What a weird way to kick me when I 'm down.
Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good -bye cheer. So okay!  Ready! Okay! Gimme an 'E!' <+++++> E!
Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how 's he doing? <+++++> He hasn 't gotten out of that chair in two days.
I know the code to his answering machine. <+++++> Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the... Okay, you're dialing, you are dialing.
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes.. <+++++> What?
Why? <+++++> I don't know.
Oh you 're serious. Sure! <+++++> Great! Well umm
And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her. <+++++> Again, very sorry.
What is going on?! <+++++> Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..
I saw it. <+++++> I don 't know what you're talking about.
Oh, it 's a poster for that World War I movie that I'm in, check it out. <+++++> Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!
All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you. <+++++> What's the part, Anti-man?
No, it 's New York magazine. It 's an article about the best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting? <+++++> Uh, I actually haven 't even met him.
Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat -or a beanbag chair! <+++++> Phoebe, you can 't get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!
Barbados! <+++++> Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right!  This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.
Okay.  Are you sure you wanna hear this? <+++++> Oh, I 'm sure.
When do you think we lost her? <+++++> Probably around gonorrhea.
Not right now. <+++++> It-it -The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
Good. Bye! <+++++> Okay! You take care!
All right, so we weren 't pre pared! <+++++> I 'm sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I-look, I just want you guys to be safe.  DANGER!!!!!  Ahhh, huh? Unagi.
Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal. <+++++> Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.
Umh... Kurts Baley? <+++++> Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract  Well, why are you laughing?
But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready. <+++++> Rachel...
Hit me! <+++++> Joe I 'm not kidding
Well, if you stay till 9 <+++++> This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way.
No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married. <+++++> I don 't know if it's true.
Hi you guys. <+++++> Hey.
Ooh, I have a little heart attack. <+++++> Right, is it painful?
All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to? <+++++> Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....
I can't believe the guys missed this. <+++++> What guys? Oh, yeah.
Then what? <+++++> My first time with Carol was...
Jij spreekt Nederlands? Dat is te gek. Heb je familie daar? (Translation <+++++> Yeah, we 're done.
We really are. <+++++> Look, I-I know it 's not a proposal and I don't know where you are, but with everything that's been going on and with Emma and I've been feeling
Hm-mmm! <+++++> Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh?
Hi. <+++++> Hi, Alan.
It 's not a real game! I made it up! <+++++> I 'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
Say we are unagi! <+++++> It 's not something you are! It's something you have!
Isn 't that great? <+++++> Ezels!!
Oh, I 'm sorry I spoiled you're evening. <+++++> No, that 's, no, as long as you're okay. So I'll ah, I'll see you tomorrow.
Uh-huh! I know. I 'm coming soon to a theater near you! I'm in THX! I'm unsuitable for children! <+++++> Now I cannot wait to see this.
I 'm going to let him. <+++++> Okay.
Ubb. <+++++> A pigeon, a pigeon.  No, no wait, no-no, an eagle flew in. Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird's aid. The eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon. Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still up lays  are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the apartment.
Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you? <+++++> Why no, it 's the opposite of weird. It's-it's uh, regular. It's-it's uh, it's mundane. It's actually uh, a little dull.
Okay. <+++++> Bye.
You think so? I 've always kinda hated it. <+++++> Aw come on, Mona Lisa?
Yeah, I can 't live with Joey once the baby comes. I don't want my child's first words to be,  "How you doin'?" <+++++> So does-does Joey know you 're moving?
We 've come for her things. <+++++> Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
Yeah. <+++++> Great! Uh, let me take this up for you.
Oh God. <+++++> Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y 'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles
Phoebe, hang on a second.  Here, take my car, go pick up your friends. <+++++> No, I 'm not gonna pick them up.
I could not have done this without you. <+++++> Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer?  I'm fine, I'm fine.
When, when did -how, how did you <+++++> We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.
Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away? <+++++> No-no-no, I 'm saying we-we buy more of this  at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else's faces.
What?! <+++++> So you were right?
Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross.   Hold on!  Hey Ross. What's up bro? <+++++> What the hell are doing?!!
Yes, Ross. <+++++> I love you.
All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday? <+++++> Why?
I would-Sequoia? <+++++> Veto.
But I think we should tell her. <+++++> Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.
Hey, everybody! <+++++> Wow!!
Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy. <+++++> What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.
Yeah, take your time. <+++++> Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn 't as bad as-as
This is gonna make me very popular. <+++++> Oh,  Believe me, the ladies, they love it!
Okay.  What?! What are you doing here?! <+++++> What are you doing here?!
Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets <+++++> No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing, okay? And
Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else? <+++++> I don't know.
Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself. <+++++> No! That's-that's my arm!
Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago. <+++++> Hey!
I knew. <+++++> You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
I guess. <+++++> Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show. <+++++> Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's just stupid.
What?! <+++++> I 'm just saying if you can't eat by yourself, how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?
I 'm not laughing. <+++++> You told her!
My scones. <+++++> ' My scones.'
Not good, Ron. <+++++> Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this  genuine pterodactyl egg  replica.
I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking? <+++++> I wasn't- I mean, I-
Hi!  Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it tonight? <+++++> Oh, absolutely!
Oh. <+++++> You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.
You just finished? <+++++> Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
Hey-hey-hey you made it! <+++++> Joey!!
Okay, well, stop staring at them. <+++++> She brought them up!  I didn't realize you were coming back so soon!
Why do they put so much steam in there?! <+++++> 'Cause otherwise they'd have to call it the room room.
Charity? <+++++> We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.
Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross... <+++++> I Ross...
Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off? <+++++> I guess so.
Huh. But still Ross, you 're worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y'know what I mean? <+++++> Oh-oh, absolutely!
Have fun! <+++++> Thanks!  Ugh, I can 't believe you're not gonna be there!
If the school finds out you 're fired. <+++++> Hmm.
A little bit. <+++++> No.
You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel. <+++++> The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
Here comes another contraction. <+++++> Oh. Okay, just breathe.
Excuse me, I 'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back, I've got a Schemp in my office.   What are you doing? <+++++> I 'm sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody's off the phone, how 'bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.
See? See? It was because you were looking fat pervert! <+++++> No-no, I 'm I'm sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy.
What?! Why? <+++++> 'Cause I know what you're trying to pull here. Okay? It's not gonna work.
Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book? <+++++> Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!
Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night. <+++++> What? I don't get a goodbye?
A what?! <+++++> You really didn't know?
Sure! <+++++> Right? And this!  She-she could 've won this!
All right. <+++++> I 'm gonna, I'm gonna go to London and I'm going to fight for her.
Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but...  you know, you and Monica have the same  "I'm gonna kill you" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her... <+++++> Get out!
This is great, this is great, what else, what else? <+++++> Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.
So? <+++++> So! Poetry? Susan 's gay! They're being gay together!
Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that. <+++++> But...
And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you 're gay and addicted to heroin. <+++++> Okay, I 'm sorry, this is insane! I-I-I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I 'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!
I think I might need one more cup of coffee. <+++++> Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya.
No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. <+++++> Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?
What?! <+++++> No, I mean, look I don 't know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don't want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
Y'know what, it doesn 't matter, 'cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook! <+++++> Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
OK, what're we gonna do about this? <+++++> Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight.
So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. How 's it going? <+++++> Ah, it 's good. It's going good. I mean, we get along great. She's, she's so
Thanks for going along with this. <+++++> Dad so what we have to pretend that we 're married?
How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea. <+++++> Oh God.
Wow, this place looks great. <+++++> Oh! You are gonna love it!  and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this.
No way! If anything you 've gotta let me win! My wife thinks I'm a wimp! <+++++> Hey, at least you have a wife! I-I keep getting divorces and knockin ' people up! And I'm dressed as doody.
Monica and I are engaged. <+++++> Oh my God.  Congratulations.
Ross! <+++++> Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.
Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good? <+++++> Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.
Okay, I 'll pay you tomorrow. <+++++> Okay.
She 's in labor! You like that you sick son of a bitch! <+++++> Umm. Umm, I 'm-I'm just gonna-
I don't know! <+++++> Answer better, answer better!
Uh-oh. <+++++> Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.
Now why would she say that's embarrassing? <+++++> Shhh.
Yeah, baby! <+++++> What are you doing?
So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe...  huh-huh? <+++++> Well, I don't know....  huh-huh.... but I'm hoping  huh-huh.
Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants. <+++++> First of all, I'm not losing...
Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty? <+++++> I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
Look, don't you think that will be a little weird? <+++++> Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!!
I can 't tell you that, no. <+++++> Ah, somebody 's at the door on the ceiling.
Ah, you mean lager. <+++++> Ah yeah. Good times.
What, because that 's your answer to everything? <+++++> No, because that 's the right thing to do.
All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad? <+++++> No, I don't think so.
Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away. <+++++> You-you-you-you  threw my sandwich away!
You bitch. <+++++> Whip it out, whip it out.
Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert! <+++++> Okay, listen I am not a pervert!
I swear I didn 't.  Hey! Is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door? <+++++> Yeah.
Hi. <+++++> Hey!
Um, hum. <+++++> Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.'
Hey! <+++++> Hello! Hello!
Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring? <+++++> Thank you!
Yeah! <+++++> Okay, I 'm going to start climb down you now.
I didn't do that. <+++++> Me neither.
Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride? <+++++> Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.
Oooh that may be a New World's record <+++++> You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called  "a globe?" Hmm?
Yeah? <+++++> is for me not to see you anymore.
Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny <+++++> No, it's just...you know the whole  "getting on with your life" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.
You love her! <+++++> What-what is love really?
Like lovers. <+++++> You know how close women can get.
Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here! <+++++> No!!
Y 'know, I can not believe you told him, Joey! <+++++> So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
Say hello to Aaron, your future son-in-law. <+++++> No-no. No.
Okay, it 's an audio question, name this television theme song. <+++++> Oh.  Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me- give me a second!
Yeah! <+++++> Yeah.
I was. <+++++> Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line.
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours. <+++++> Oh, you're...
What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table. <+++++> Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.
Seriously? <+++++> Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?
Ohh, give him a kiss for me! <+++++> All right, bye!
Why are you going? He said, she wanted the shrew! <+++++> Rach, c'mon, Emma is fine. You're turning into an obsessive mother. Okay, you need to stop.
Yeah, his name is Ross.  What? <+++++> Oh, nothing, it 's just, it's close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?
Great! <+++++> Like uh y 'know like this! This!  She-she could've made this!
Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl? <+++++> Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who...
Really? Wow, this is so much better than I <+++++> Ohh! Ew!
Yeah well, you know what, so is uh, Sorentino's. <+++++> Wha, OK, I'm sorry, let's uh, why don't we find someplace else.
Hey guys, what are you doing? <+++++> Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.
Am I interrupting? <+++++> Uh yes! Thank you.
Oh my God. <+++++> I 'm sorry about your date.
I know. <+++++> 
Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants? <+++++> Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.
Hold on! You got her pregnant? <+++++> Yeah.
Umm, no thank you. <+++++> What's with her?
Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk? <+++++> If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
Uh-huh. <+++++> I 'm not going to do that.
Yeah. <+++++> Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh
Alright, 5 more minutes. <+++++> Hello?  Oh no! What happened?  Ok ok, where are you? . Ok, I'll be right there.
There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross? <+++++> Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won 't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver. There! That wasn't about the wedding. <+++++> Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I 'll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
Okay. <+++++> Okay. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Ohh great. <+++++> Can I, can I help you with something?
Umm that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some- something huh? <+++++> Yeah. Yeah, it really was. But we we gotta be careful. We we can't let that happen again, y'know?
Y 'know, I can't believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I'm never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants! <+++++> Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take  'em off and we'll have some fun.
I'm talking about me having a baby. <+++++> What?
And you Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel 's bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there. <+++++> You 're good.  These are not.
They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra ... <+++++> Monica!
Hellooo! <+++++> Hey.
You're not Rachel. <+++++> Still sharp as a tack!
Morning. Here you go. <+++++> Thanks. Did you stay here all night?
Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?! <+++++> Uh-huh.
Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it. <+++++> Why, why would you open it?
Oh, I don't know. <+++++> Joey, it's worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.
Ah, who is Emma? <+++++> I told you about my daughter.
I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum. <+++++> Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.
I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time. <+++++> Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.
You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I? <+++++> You-you had what?
Yeah! <+++++> Wow! I 'm honored! And y'know what I'm gonna do as my first act as your best friend?
Yes! <+++++> What?
We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy. <+++++> Go over there and tell that woman the truth.
And? <+++++> Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked.
Hi! <+++++> How 's my little boy?
No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don 't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open. <+++++> Oh, who? Me?
Oh, really? <+++++> Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn 't really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it's gonna make a difference
Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be... <+++++> Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!
Hey! <+++++> So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
Maybe... <+++++> Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.
I 'm sorry, so umm, so where are we? <+++++> Well, well to sum up, we 're having fun, you look young.
You know he's gay? <+++++> I just wanna clarify this
Mmh-mmh. <+++++> Can you say Barbados?
I know! Hey, you haven 't been practising the routine, have you? <+++++> No!
Yeah, leave! <+++++> Yeah, get out! Now!
Hey. <+++++> I 'm gonna be on TV!!
Howdy doody. <+++++> That 's funny. Yeah. Y'know you're the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.
We won't? <+++++> 
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges. <+++++> Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!
What?! <+++++> You're looking!
Hey, you know what might help? <+++++> I'm not getting you a muffin!
Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister! <+++++> Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh!
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done. <+++++> Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
Oh, ah, isn't there another professor that is supposed to come with us? <+++++> I don't think so.
Oh, no problem. I 'm so glad I could help. Happy for you. <+++++> Happy for you.
Cool... "Urkel" in Spanish is "Urkel." <+++++> How did he do this?
Ugh! <+++++> Yeah, I still don't know.  I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says,  "Kids welcome here." But that also says,  "Come here to me!"
Swear?! <+++++> I swear!
Okay. <+++++> Go ahead.
I didn't know you guys hung out. <+++++> We don't. But I thought it would be nice to get to know him. You know, maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.
Yeah, me too. <+++++> Yeah, make that three.
All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve. <+++++> Hey, what's wrong?
Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating? <+++++> What do you mean?
What are you talking about?! <+++++> Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off one item of clothing. It hasn 't happened yet, but we're all very excited. <+++++> Okay, come on!  Daddy needs a new pair of electromagnetic microscopes for the Prehistoric Forensics Department!   Okay.  Take Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point, collect three cool points!! Yeah! Which gives me five, and let 's see who is gonna lose their clothes. Ummmm, I think I pick our strip poker sponsor Mr. Joey Tribianni.
I licked my arm, what? <+++++> It's breast milk.
Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything. <+++++> You're kidding.
Really? <+++++> Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?
Yeah! <+++++> We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
Really. <+++++> Yeah. What do you think.
You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you 've got a girlfriend? <+++++> Is this about Mark?
Ooh... Is it because of what might be on the bedspread, because I saw that news report too, with the infra red and the ... I could just... <+++++> No, NO!  Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it.
Ok, I'll walk you out. <+++++> Bye Ryan.
Oh, yay! <+++++> Thanks, I put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift.
Hey, do you want to go away this weekend? <+++++> We'll see.
Hi <+++++> Hi!  Hey mom.
Well look, you don 't really like the one from uptown and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done! <+++++> Y 'know, you're right. Thank you.
Hey! Hi! <+++++> Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
Good luck, with your girlfriend. <+++++> Oh, thank you.  Hey, hey.  Rachel!!!!
We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle? <+++++> Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.
We're gonna have sex. <+++++> I don't feel like having sex. Maybe we can watch a movie or something.
Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch! <+++++> Stop going through my stuff !
Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke. <+++++> I am good. Okay! Okay! Uh, I got the pillow! I got the bag! You got the keys?
No, of course, of course I 've heard of them! Ross, what did you get? <+++++> Huh? Oh, I got this --this!
Why can 't you get a girlfriend your own age? <+++++> That 's funny. Umm .  It's not funny.
I 've never been more convinced of your love for her. <+++++> I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?!
No. <+++++> I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole  "seizing" thing but um, Emily called you today. <+++++> You talked to her?
And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do. <+++++> I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.
Two it is. Ross, how about you? <+++++> Uh, yeah, I ah, I also need two.
Ross, look, I know I 've been giving you a lot of jabs and it's partly because I'm very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told me and the many, many,  many stories that Rachel has told me that, well  you're not  all bad. <+++++> Not all bad.
Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me.  What? <+++++> What should I wear, now I 'm all nervous.
Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out. <+++++> Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?
We took a cab. Did you guys walk? <+++++> N No! We took a cab too, but I did test runs!
Hey, you got me, put it in. <+++++> 
Huh. <+++++> What?
Well then,  what about you?! Huh?! <+++++> I 'm the ring bearer.
What's that? <+++++> Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.
Mm. Unless we go with a different dress? <+++++> No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.
Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser! <+++++> A loser you did it with  298 times!
I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that. <+++++> Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.
Okay dude!  Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers. <+++++> That 's right.
You know what honey, you go ahead, we 'll call her an alternate. <+++++> Okay, hold my crawler.
Happy birthday!!! <+++++> Rach! Come on! Rach!
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation , and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad . <+++++> Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,
FYI.. <+++++> There it is...
Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before? <+++++> Yeah, sure.
God, I 'm exhausted. <+++++> Look this is starting to look really bad for me. Okay? Mona, Mona 's standing right over there.  Oh God, she's talking to Joey! You gotta let me win!
I can come back. <+++++> Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?
Your mother just added him to her list. <+++++> What? Your-your list?
She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us. <+++++> Come on, she's gonna love you guys!
Yeah. You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off. <+++++> I can do that.
Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!! <+++++> I... I don't know..
This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week. <+++++> Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.
Hey. <+++++> Hi.
Uh, actually I find Marion 's views far to progressionist. <+++++> I find Marion 's views far to progressionist.
I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us. <+++++> You wanna know how she knew him?  Because Phoebe used to mug people.
Can't wait. <+++++> Come on, they're gonna love you.
Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it! <+++++> What?
Dude, you're shaking! <+++++> I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?
Oh God! <+++++> Hey, you guys! Guess what?
Eh, y'know what, she 's to political, she probably wouldn't let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first. <+++++> And!! Isabella Rosselini.
14? <+++++> No, 19.
Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me. <+++++> Yeah -No!!
Y 'know, I'm still 29 in Guam. <+++++> Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?
Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog! <+++++> Le Poo's still alive?!
Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants. <+++++> Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she?
See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's! <+++++> Why are they here?
Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven 't even thought about what I will say. What should I say? <+++++> I 'm understanding, but let's not get carried away.
You can open your eyes now. <+++++> Are we off the bridge?
Well <+++++> All right, try pedaling.
I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it. <+++++> I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.
Space cowboy! <+++++> Correct! What is Chandler Bing's job?
Ooh! That's so nice... <+++++> ...Chandler!
Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental. <+++++> Oh, I promise, what.
No. No-no-no-no. <+++++> Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actually -I-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.
Wow. <+++++> You know what, it 's, it's better this way anyway. I mean I don't know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. It's just much easier if we're just friends who have a kid.
Come on.  Oh! And, uh, by the way.... <+++++> What?
Eleven minutes.  And now twelve. So, do you like the beer? <+++++> I do. I do. Although, it's actually a lager.
No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister. <+++++> Hey!
Ross, how could you let this happen? <+++++> I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's...
That 's so sweet. <+++++> Yeah.
What was that? <+++++> Monica knows.
Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star. <+++++> Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and -Hey! I'll hold you up and-and push you. Okay?
So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story? <+++++> Yeah. Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesn 't matter. I mean, I think it would've happened either way. I mean if you hadn't initiated it I-I-I know I would've.
Mother-Kisser...  I'll shut up. <+++++> Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
I wasn 't escaping. <+++++> Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
Y 'know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she's l-l-lookin' up at us and smiling right now. <+++++> Looking up?
Ow! Ross!! <+++++> Oh, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry sweetie, I was just trying to ah, I'm dialing another number.
You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that. <+++++> Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
Hey! <+++++> Mon, look who I ran into!
What about all that  "friends forever" stuff? <+++++> I don 't know, I-I was all high.
Bye. <+++++> So . . . Welcome.
Hey you. <+++++> Hey you.
Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition. <+++++> Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.
We already knew that! <+++++> I'm having a son. Um...
This is it. Unless we're on a break. <+++++> Don't make jokes now.
All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies? <+++++> Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
All right, big brother.  Which of these do you think would make your little sister look hotter, so your best friend would want to do her? <+++++> The red one.
She took all my stuff. <+++++> Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one.
Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker. <+++++> And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn 't know he was in there.
What are you doing? <+++++> Nothing, I 'm-I'm just, I'm so comfortable with you!
Nothing. Just something I want to get Phoebe's opinion on for Valentine's Day. <+++++> You don't want my opinion?
Don't play with his things. <+++++> I know.
Fine!  We went out. <+++++> Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!
Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you <+++++> None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That's not the point. Ok? The point is you...you are the one
Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48.... <+++++> Thank you.
Ok. <+++++> I hear ya.
I just really wanted to apologize again and and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting. <+++++> Oh my god, crap from the street?
So what are you going to do? <+++++> Nothing! There 's nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she'd have to uh, move here. She should move here!
No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22. <+++++> What?
Okay. <+++++> What?
We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes. <+++++> Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we-  Sorry. Sorry.
Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something. <+++++> She's doing her laundry.
Vulva? <+++++> Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
That's okay. If - if we hit anything, the engine will explode, so you know, it's better if you're thrown from the car. <+++++> Alright, alright, let's do this!
What married? <+++++> Well yeah, I think we should get married.
Okay, then. <+++++> Okay.
Hey buddy. <+++++> Uh, hi.
I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say <+++++> There's nothing you can say. That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me.
Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2! <+++++> Joey, we just saw it!
If you want it to be. <+++++> Here 's your girlfriend's button.
Hit me! <+++++> Oohh, 23.  Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars!
Would you like to move over to the couch? <+++++> Mmm-Hmm.
Well, that 's great. <+++++> Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it 's going to be torn down, so I mean, I-I know it's crazy, but everything up 'til now has been so crazy, and I don't know, this just feels right. Y'know?
The sex of the baby, Ross. <+++++> Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!
Oh, yes! We'll have ourselves a little baby Ruth <+++++> Permission to veto.
No! It 's just that, Kate bothered me. <+++++> Why? What was wrong with her?
I want to. I love her so much, but I 'm afr It's too huge. <+++++> Y 'know, okay. You're right. It is huge. So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
Great! <+++++> Hey
All right! So, was it amazing? <+++++> It was, it was okay.
Um, would you like to come in? <+++++> Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?
Oh my god. <+++++> Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.
No!! You can 't!! <+++++> Look, they must be stopped!
With ah, extra anchovies. <+++++> That 's okay, I'll just pick 'em off.
Do you wanna play football? <+++++> Um, Monica and I aren 't supposed to play football.
Hey! Don 't do the crime if you can't do the time. <+++++> Joey, the guy 's your best friend.
Okay, now would you say that that 's more than 50 yards away from Sting, his wife, or a member of his family? <+++++> Yeah.
Hi! I 'm gal pal Rachel Green, and if you want the dirt, I'm the one you come too. This might be Joey's baby , who knows? I'm just kidding-Seriously,  gal pal Rachel Green. <+++++> Who just lost the respect of her unborn child.
But, I put some honey in it. <+++++> She doesn 't know she was fired yet, does she?
Hey. <+++++> Chandler. I sensed it was you.
All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life? <+++++> My son? Pretty serious.  Oh hey Katie!  What uh, what are you doing here?
Yes! She 's gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo. <+++++> What -You're not serious. I mean she's a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. She'll drive us totally crazy.
Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift. <+++++> No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!
I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey. <+++++> Just, just say what you feel.
Me! On my computer. <+++++> Well you sure used a large font.
I've had a really good time tonight. <+++++> Mmm.
Is he alright? <+++++> Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.
Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about. <+++++> Okay, shoot!
Come on you guys, we want you to know we're  very very sorry.   Right guys? <+++++> I feel terrible.
Okay. <+++++> Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What?  Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three.  Well you didn't hang up either.
No? <+++++> No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.
Like your sweater. <+++++> Oh hey, right back at ya.
We'll watch him. <+++++> I don't think tho.
Well, why don 't you tell her to stop being silly! <+++++> Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I 've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica 's place was nice, but her fiancee sure stares a lot. <+++++> Oh.
Noo. <+++++> You still love me.
Making her a mixed tape? <+++++> Uh, bigger than that.
I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo. <+++++> Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I'm afraid it's not working out.
Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?! <+++++> J-j-just relax, nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that you were getting better.
Okay. Let 's use this brush. <+++++> Okay. This stuff?
I like it! <+++++> Eh? We 'll show him!
Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess! <+++++> Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!
To be nice. <+++++> Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
So it was really cool seeing you lecture today. <+++++> Oh thanks. Although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there a little.
Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR! <+++++> Rach, she 's got like three hairs!
Name?  I know Ross but what 's it short for? You know like, like Rossel or Rosstepher. <+++++> Just Ross!
You are so adorable. <+++++> That! Let 's talk about that.
Chandler! What are you doing here? <+++++> Hey!
Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place. <+++++> Yeah, that 's the one. Listen, I don't want to hurt her.
Congratulations! <+++++> This is the single greatest day of my professional career. Gunther, six glasses!
Okay! <+++++> Monica. Whaddya think?

Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that 's-that's crazy-I mean that's crazy. So what's-what's going on with you? What is going on with you? <+++++> Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...' <+++++> Shhhh!
I 'm just making margaritas. <+++++> Okay.
Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates? <+++++> Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
Hey! <+++++> What are you doing here, Santa?
Yeah I'm fine. <+++++> You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
Rachel Green. <+++++> Aw -oh, that's right. Are-are you gonna be okay?
Miss, I can't let you off the plane. <+++++> Let her off the plane!
I 'm all done. <+++++> Thank God.
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again? <+++++> Yes, you can, very much.
Hey you! <+++++> Hey, come on in.
So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks? <+++++> Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!
Oh my God!!! Ross!! <+++++> Well, I 'm sorry, but ah, look if you're not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?
Oh really?! You think you 're stronger? Why don't you prove it? <+++++> Oh I 'll prove it! I'll prove it like a theorem!!
So whose is it? <+++++> Umm, I don 't some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later.
Yeah, coffeehouse. <+++++> Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum? <+++++> Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to work. I -What?  No! Wh What are you doing?!!  GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I 'm an actor, y'know? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic. <+++++> Rachel who 's carrying my baby? Rachel?
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW! <+++++> I know nothing! Mike's a great guy, it was hypothetical!
Ooh, yeah! She said she 's having sooo much fun with Emily. <+++++> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don 't know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
What d'you want? <+++++> You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?
Oh no Ross! This is not good, we have to talk about this Joey thing. Please sit.  You have got to get over this Joey thing, okay? I never really wanted to marry Joey, okay? <+++++> Okay.
Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger. <+++++> Awww.
Awesome! <+++++> Yeah?
Fine. <+++++> Unless   You anticipated that I would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named Ruth! Well, I'm not falling for that! Okay? Ruth is off the table!
Nothing. <+++++> Okay, can we just sign please?
No, no. He said  "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?" <+++++> Wow!
I 'll be right there!  Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we've gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me? <+++++> All right, I 'll do it.
Yeah. <+++++> Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell...  Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?
Who isn't? <+++++> I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross.
Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. <+++++> Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in Europe? Here's a question
Hi. <+++++> Hi.
She 's steaming her dress, why? What's up? <+++++> I think Chandler 's gone.
No!! <+++++> I 'm afraid the TV Guide comes to Chinandolor Bong.
No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go! <+++++> You will?!
Yeah, y 'know. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. It'll be cute, okay? <+++++> Okay.
Do you not see it? <+++++> See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.
Well, maybe you don't need them. <+++++> My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.
 <+++++> Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....
What? <+++++> That's right. The student has become the master.
I 'm sorry, let her? <+++++> What can I do, she doesn 't listen to me about renter's insurance either.
Uh no, they 're still here but I think I'm about to leave. <+++++> What?! No! No! Wait! You 're right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There's nothing wrong with that. Come on.  Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.
That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but I am prepared to let that go. <+++++> So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend.
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I 'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye.  I just did it.  I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it. <+++++> Oh, I got it.
Then I won't have to kill you. <+++++> So you wanna watch uh, Entertainment Tonight?
Oh God! <+++++> Oh no!
Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who 's going with who? <+++++> Look, you guys, you guys should go.  No, I 'm, you, you planned this all out, and I don't want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.
Ok I gotta tell ya, it's really weird when you use my whole name. <+++++> Sorry. . You ok?
You play hard to get. <+++++> She already lives in London.
No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up? <+++++> I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me,  'cause maybe I need to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now? <+++++> Y 'know what? Y'know what? Rachel, just-just drop it.
No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he 's gonna double the college money my Grandma left me. <+++++> Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?
Hi, I'm Sally. So, no ring. Can I assume you are also a single parent? <+++++> I am a single parent.
One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, I'm dying on the gurney. Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want to go down there and say goodbye. <+++++> Ahh, oh that's OK, I mean, he's probably got, you know, parties to go to and stuff. But, ya know, he's moved on. Hey, that, that's the way it goes right.
New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la... <+++++> OK, here goes.
What?! <+++++> What?!
They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next... la la la la la la. <+++++> Help!
Because she hates Pottery Barn. <+++++> She hates Pottery Barn?!!
Ooh, oh, oh, that's her. <+++++> Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind.
No. You have got it completely wrong. John Savage was deerhunter, no legs, John Voit was coming home, couldn't feel his legs. <+++++> No, no way. You've got it totally the other way around my friend. John Voit was...
So far, I 've sold seventy-five. <+++++> Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able.  How much are the boxes?
I don 't know, maybe I can't. I mean, maybe there's something wrong with me. <+++++> Oh, no! No!
Ohh, I thought that you.... <+++++> Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn 't seem so bad? <+++++> Bye.
Hey! <+++++> Hey, what have you guys been up to?
I saw you. <+++++> Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.
By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall. <+++++> Come on.
I don 't know!   Yeah, I do. <+++++> Joey!
Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal. <+++++> OH NO!
I, er... <+++++> I want to take my tongue... and...
Dude! What is going on?! <+++++> I just I have to find out how it went.
Uh-huh. <+++++> We met at Phoebe 's birthday party, I'm, I'm Ross Geller.
Hey. <+++++> Hey.
Yeah! Right! <+++++> You 're right. That's very different. So let's, let's just sign the papers. All right?  What?
Oh stop that! <+++++> I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.
Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don 't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck. <+++++> Oh, now you want a favour?
That 's just halftime, there's more of this. <+++++> Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!
Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off. <+++++> Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."
It 's good to see you man. <+++++> Yeah, you too. Man, so-so what are you up to?
All right! Who's are they? Who's are they? <+++++> Well, they're not mine!
Tell him. <+++++> It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!
So it 's noticeable huh? <+++++> Look, is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her.
Are you worried your date came, saw you, and left? <+++++> No!
Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me out here. <+++++> I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life.
Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center. <+++++> Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?
Marcel! Where are you going with that disc? <+++++> You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OK -if you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble.
Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you! <+++++> Phoebe!
Hey! <+++++> What 's up?
Watch, watch. <+++++> Ooohhhh!!
Huh. <+++++> Oh, actually I haven't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages?
Yeah, he's the best. <+++++> Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
That's really a day shoe. <+++++> And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
Oh, hi! <+++++> Hi!
Why? Who'd you seen him with? <+++++> No one, I'm just saying if...
Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind 've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose. <+++++> It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed. <+++++> Whoa! You were down on one knee?
Ok well give her a chance to see all of that! <+++++> Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her.
Well, apparently he scares easy. <+++++> Oh, Rachel, I 'm-I'm sorry.
I can 't believe I still don't know what happened to the window in the attic! <+++++> Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper!  Yes we 're surprised!  Who did you leave a message with?
What up?! <+++++> Everyone, this is Julie.
Earl Grey? <+++++> Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.
Yes. Not out loud. <+++++> Pheebs, if you don 't tell him, soon he's gonna be married, and then you're gonna hate yourself.
Okay! <+++++> Cool!
All right, it won 't go down any further. It's stuck. <+++++> Ugh. Well, we 're just gonna have to jump.  Yeah. Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there you go up to the roof and you let me in.
I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of... <+++++> Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
Oh, well you know who I love the most? <+++++> No.
Yes, the Philange is fixed. As a matter of fact, we put a whole lot of extra Philanges onboard, just in case. <+++++> Where is she?
Wow! That was amazing! <+++++> Thank you so much for that gift!
I don 't know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids. <+++++> Oh my God! Those weren 't albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!
Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks! <+++++> Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.
That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams. <+++++> Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.
The Metsss! <+++++> Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Oh that 's sweet. Don't touch me. <+++++> Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
You were invited?! <+++++> No.
You know what? Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here . <+++++> Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?
Well, so what're you gonna do? <+++++> Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.
No, just a Friday night. <+++++> Ohh, these are pretty good.
No. <+++++> Hey.
Oh my God!  Where the hell have you been?!! <+++++> Just, y'know out.
Ciao, bela. <+++++> Do they wait for me to do this?
Pathetic mess? I know, but -come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching!  Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this. <+++++> Hi. She said yes.
Jan-Janice! <+++++> Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything.
Yes, you can, very much. <+++++> Ahhhh!!
Yeah! I don't think you're going to need it though. Okay, check this out. If it's a girl, Rain. <+++++> Veto.
Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me. <+++++> Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly . Molly, Chandler, Joey.
Hi, is uh Phoebe here? <+++++> Uh no-no, she-she 's out for the night.
Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama. <+++++> Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
Okay... Hey listen, just before you go I-I again, I just wanna say "thank you" for coming with me. <+++++> Oh, no problem.
Professor Geller? <+++++> Hmm?  Oh, a student I don 't know.
You're in! <+++++> Aw, right.
Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie? <+++++> Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.
Yeah. <+++++> Turn.
I think you just have a cold, it's definitely not Strep. <+++++> Thanks doctor.
Oh my god <+++++> I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book
Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh- u -a! Joshua! Josh. <+++++> Uh, hello!
When's that? <+++++> Tonight.
Man, I 'm starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both! <+++++> Y 'know, y'know I'm lookin' and I don't think anyone's home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y'know explain later.
Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that I 'm going to Florida for a couple weeks. <+++++> No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was
I really do. <+++++> Okay, I 'm gonna get your coat and then I'll-I'll put you in a cab.
Ugh. <+++++> I'm serious. I just don't trust that guy, okay?
Then we took a walk down to Bendall's , and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel... <+++++> That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth? <+++++> Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn 't want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she's going to Florida for spring vacation.
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user. <+++++> What?!
Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don 't want to take a break. <+++++> I 've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here. <+++++> How come? Everybody else does.
Hey. <+++++> Uh, sweetie we've gotta go.
Good different? <+++++> Nobody likes change.
OK, everyone gather up. <+++++> 'Scuse us
That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody. <+++++> Goodnight.
Oh, come on. <+++++> Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really would 've wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was.
Wait, so, you're going? <+++++> Well, OK, I uh, I have to. I can't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh, y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm... I'm gonna go get a cat.
It was just so awkward and bumpy. <+++++> Bumpy?
Happy birthday. <+++++> Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?
What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me. <+++++> Come on!
Rosss... <+++++> Come on, would you grow up? It 's no big deal.
Bye Ross. <+++++> Bye.
Okay, umm, I 'm gonna get my sweater. <+++++> Okay.  You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
Okay. 'Cause this is where I wanna be, okay? No more messing around. I don't wanna mess this up again. <+++++> Me neither, okay? We are - we're done being stupid.
Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?! <+++++> No! No!  No!  No-no-no-no.
Okay. <+++++> Thank you.
Hi! Emma will be up in a minute! <+++++> Oh, good!
I 'm Irish. <+++++> And the Irish guy wins the joke!
Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place. <+++++> I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
Morning. <+++++> Where ya goin'?
Hey, Ben! Hey! <+++++> So umm, any word from Susan?
Hey. <+++++> What's up?

A pajmena? <+++++> Yeah! Oh, I-I love this babies!
You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there. <+++++> Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty free".
Well? <+++++> Well it's really. . . sexy. I wouldn't have thought it would be but. . . wow.
I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash; <+++++> Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, "Oh my god I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?
Kathy 's with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude! <+++++> Dude, we are sooo gonna party!
I 'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy. <+++++> Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don 't want to make it savory.
Hi. <+++++> Hey Erica, welcome back to town!  Wow, look how big you've gotten.
What you do mean? <+++++> I think, sub-consciously
Uhh . <+++++> Ah Ah Get out of here!  Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion's views on evolution?
We can 't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it. <+++++> Em-Emily?  Em-Emily?  Emily!
Yes! Did you see that? <+++++> You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
You didn 't tell her did you? <+++++> No.
Oh my God. <+++++> I know.
Dude that is so sad. <+++++> I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
All right, well how much time do you need? <+++++> Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel? <+++++> No, and I'm not going to.
It 's not looking good. <+++++> Oh.  Oh. Well I uh, I brought her some bloemen.
And look where they're sitting. <+++++> You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.
Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don 't! <+++++> Don 't yell at me okay, this is the most I've seen you all week.
Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it. <+++++> Ok.  Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?! <+++++> No.
Ohh, I don 't think so. I mean it would be different if it was way into the future -and-and-and we were getting married or something. <+++++> What?
Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there. <+++++> You ever figure out what that thing's for?
No! No! No Ross! I 'm not hot! Are you hot? <+++++> It 's been six months! I'm always hot!
I know  but they're just so beautiful! Oh, my God, I just pulled one out. <+++++> I promise you she 's safe! No watch how much she loves this.
Really?! <+++++> Oh, and also, he 's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know...
Sounds good. <+++++> It really was!
Yes sir. <+++++> Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I 'm afraid I-I had to fail you.
Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had! <+++++> I 've had better.
I think it's interesting. <+++++> I do too! I missed you!
What? <+++++> That audition.
What? <+++++> I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-
I, I was just thinking about how much more we have to talk about. <+++++> But you left.
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you!  Huh? You're-you're a cowboy! <+++++> Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
Okay. <+++++> It 's just I miss her so much.
Hello? <+++++> Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!
Yeah, we'll be okay. <+++++> Love you guys.
You suck!! <+++++> What?!
Maurice. <+++++> Correct, his profession was?
Oh, Liam. <+++++> Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something -or should I call it  football?
I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, I 'm so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. You're gonna have to tell me how you did that. <+++++> Focus.
That's so sweet. <+++++> And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already? <+++++> I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
Oh no, I know I couldn 't see it either at first, but it's right umm  Ross, I lost it again. <+++++> Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.
Me too. <+++++> Hi Jill!
Oh. Okay! How can I help you? <+++++> Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?
It was a car backfire! <+++++> Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!
Marcel? <+++++> Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.
Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this. <+++++> Female body inspector? What size is that?
Right-right up here. <+++++> Joey where 's the pipe that was holding the door open?
Thank you. I yeah. <+++++> I mean after tomorrow night.
Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert? <+++++> You wanna wander in the hall?  Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?

Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look!  Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now. <+++++> Wow.
He took my essence! <+++++> Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?
Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...?  That slayed me. <+++++> Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you!
How many did you want? I 'm getting a hundred. <+++++> A hundred?! Well, I-I guess I 'll take a-Mona, uh I-I'm not sure about the whole uh, card thing.
All right. Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why don 't you tell us a little something about you Ross? <+++++> Well uh, I-I 'm a paleontologist. Umm, I-I live in New York. I have a son Ben. Uh, hi Ben!  And uh
C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy,  Huh? Huh? Huh? <+++++> What are you doing?

Well I 'm alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy bars, what do you think? <+++++> Uh-huh. What happened?
Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other. Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard. Oh God oh! Contraction! <+++++> Yeah? Okay.
Hey! <+++++> So uh, Emily called last night
Oh? Really? That 's what my daughter means to you? Nothing? <+++++> No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care -I-I love Rachel.
Really? Excited? <+++++> Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...
No. <+++++> Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?
Listen, y 'know what? I was really freaked out too when I found out <+++++> Freaked out? Hey no, I 'm not freaked out! I'm indignant! As a consumer!
Emily 's straight. <+++++> Oh, wake up!
And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and  You go. <+++++> But-but, if you don 't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time. Really, it's fine, whatever you want.
It's an expression. <+++++> Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.
All right, I promise. I 'll fix this. I swear. I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll talk to her. <+++++> Okay!
No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet. <+++++> C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.
What are you taking amoxicillin for? <+++++> How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that's
Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom? <+++++> Oh!
Oh, I remember how we almost. Do you think we would 've gone through with it? Y'know, if we hadn't gotten caught. Do you think we would've done it? <+++++> I mean I I know I wanted to. I just, I just wasn't sure if you wanted to.
You don't say. <+++++> So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
All right, let's go Pheebs. <+++++> Oh God!
You 're about 80 percent effaced, so you're on your way. It still could last a little while longer. If you're anxious there are a few ways to help things along. <+++++> Do them!!
Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour.  That didn't happen, I made that up! <+++++> Hey!
Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here. <+++++> Fine, just stop thinking about me.
Yeah, I just got uh, got plans. <+++++> Well, John McLane had plans!
Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I 'm... I'm gonna pick up some really good stuff for you. <+++++> Really?
Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her. <+++++> Wow!
No, it 's a water balloon fight! We started it! <+++++> Oh!  Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, it 's supposed to be excellent. The director is the same
Ross, wants a pajmena? <+++++> It 's a rug.
... Ok, who is this? <+++++> I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.
Absolutely. <+++++> There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge!
You got to tell me exactly what to do there. <+++++> Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.
That 's Carol with your son! <+++++> Uhh, believe me when he 's older, he'll understand.
Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong? <+++++> Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.
Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape. <+++++> I know, I wasn 't finished.   But don't worry! We're gonna go down the fire escape!!
Oh you did, there are twenty in here. <+++++> Right. Good night.
Yes, I do. <+++++> No you do -y'know what, you're not gonna suck me into this.
Hi! <+++++> Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?
Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question. <+++++> Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.
Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win. <+++++> Yeah.
I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can 't do it, they're all like-like laughing at me. <+++++> Hello.
Y'know it 's ironic... <+++++> What?
You think he 's emotionally unavailable? <+++++> I think he can be.
Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it. <+++++> Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny... <+++++> And sexy.
There. Now there is. <+++++> Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
Hi, it 's me. I've been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid. <+++++> Yeah!!
This is your grandmother 's engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel. <+++++> Mom no, come on! Thank you.
 <+++++> These aren't suede.
YAY! WHOO! YAY! <+++++> You're excited, right?
Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow? <+++++> You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that.
Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal. <+++++> Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
Hey Ross! <+++++> Hey!
"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!" <+++++> C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?
Hi. <+++++> Hi!
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear -you want it to be dirty? <+++++> No.
Oh I was just thinking. You know what would be incredible? If you guys died. <+++++> Thank you Amy.
See, I didn't know that. <+++++> Well, there you go.
No. <+++++> Well, I do, so let's...  So, Ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?
Yeah, it's fun . <+++++> What?
But sadly I could not be enticed. <+++++> Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
I am supposed to be the mommy? <+++++> Okay, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time.
Sure. <+++++> Yep?
Hey! <+++++> Hi!
And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place.... <+++++> With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!
Because if I go home, we 're gonna become the Bings! I can't be the Bings! <+++++> What 's wrong with being the Bings?
All right, buddy! <+++++> So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just .
I get that a lot. <+++++> Okay umm, why don 't we all take a seat, y'know? And uh, and I'll get us all some uh some coffees--Yeah, why don't you.  Uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y'know? Whatever pops into your head.
Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out? <+++++> Professor Neuman, the head of the department, so .
I'm sorry, I got a little occupied. <+++++> We have to stop them before something happens!
As in my grandmother. <+++++> Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?
Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing. <+++++> Oh my -Come here! Come here!  It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.
Really? <+++++> Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are- are my I mean, I 'm lucky to have just one good
No! <+++++> So you 're strong enough to face her on your own?
Yeah, maybe... <+++++> Okay... okay, maybe I will...
You mean they're lovers. <+++++> If you wanna put a label on it.
Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn 't get it? <+++++> And why wouldn't he get it?
Are you serious?  Oh my God. <+++++> Damn! I can 't believe I took her off my list.
Hi! <+++++> Umm, would you like to dance?
Oh great! <+++++> Hello?
Elizabeth Hornswoggle? <+++++> That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
Oh, I made a little something. If I had more time to work on it, it'd be better, but.. <+++++> Oh my God! You did that yourself?
We could write it down for you? <+++++> No, no, that won 't be ah, that won't be necessary
Ok, good!  You guys were so scared! There was no way I was gonna dump this... Oh God, no!  I think I broke your bowl. <+++++> Go, go, go!!
Oh, honey that's awful. <+++++> Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
And now you 're giving me the message! <+++++> Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they 're going to the theatre together! They're going to dinner! They're going horseback riding!
It was really fun being married to you tonight. <+++++> Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I 've ever made.
Is he right? Am I really -Am I awful? <+++++> No!
Oh dear God. <+++++> Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis.   What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me  Cheers.
I wanna see it. <+++++> What?!
Sorry, sorry. <+++++> Monica!
God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!! <+++++> Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn 't happen!
Wow!! <+++++> Wh-haa-haa! Look what  'cha did!
Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married? <+++++> Well sure. But I get married all the time so
Should I tell her I ordered tea? <+++++> No.
No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret? <+++++> Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
Hi. <+++++> Hi.
Yep. <+++++> O-kay. Well, I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast.
Whoa, for like months? <+++++> Five to be lying, six.
What? <+++++> Look, look, look.
Hi! <+++++> You ah, wanted to see me?
Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah. Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do. <+++++> Phoebe, I had no idea you were so conventional.
Maye it's me. <+++++> Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants.
So this is nice! I wish I didn 't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to.  Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating? <+++++> Kristen Lang.
Aren 't you with that girl over there? <+++++> Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that 's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people,  so I'm allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it's flattery.
I hope you 're going somewhere with this. <+++++> Look at you! What -You're-you're this big executive! You are much more capable than you give yourself credit for. I-I have no doubt you're gonna be an incredible mother.
Hey, hold on a second. <+++++> Okay.
Why-why aren't you more excited? <+++++> Oh, Rach...oh..."gleba" is not a word.
Oh my God, does she really thinks that? <+++++> Well, can you blame her?
What do you mean? <+++++> Carol our sex life is -it's just not working
Ugh, she 's upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! I 'm not doing them this time! I don't care if those dishes sit in the sink until they're all covered with-I'll do them when I get home! <+++++> Yeah -oh! Hey listen umm, Emily found this wedding dress in London
Hi! <+++++> Hi. Sorry we're late but we were -well, there was touching.
Ross, where did you get this?! <+++++> I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
Ross! <+++++> Okay, maybe it wasn 't my best decision. But I just couldn't face another failed marriage.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself. <+++++> Helps a little.
I 'll be okay. <+++++> Okay, I 'll see you soon buddy.  Be back in an hour.
Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy? <+++++> Mike  "Gandolf" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world.
You were amazing out there. <+++++> Oh, I kinda was, wasn 't I?
Yeah. Ahh, here 's a box of your stuff. <+++++> What?!
I 'm next! <+++++> Oh!
What're you gonna do, suck the door open? <+++++> Help! Help!
Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay! <+++++> Hey!
Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand. <+++++> Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
Hey and look he brought flowers. Thanks Ross, but I 'm really more of a candy guy. <+++++> You 're weird today.   Listen I uh, wanted to talk to you about something.
Hey! What the hell are you doing?! <+++++> Say something clever!  Okay, doesn 't have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words.  Any words will do.  Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever!   There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!!   I-I, I uh haven't had sex in a very long time.   Yeah, you really shouldn 't have said anything.
Oh well <+++++> I can handle the stick!!
Nobody likes change. <+++++> What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Oh, damn you Geller! <+++++> Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings.
Thanks. <+++++> Quack, quack..
Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died! <+++++> You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
Ok, don't get me started on gravity. <+++++> You uh, you don't believe in gravity?
Well that 's no way to sell newspapers. Why don't you try, "Extra! Extra! Read all about it!" <+++++> No, Monica 's restaurant got a horrible review in the Post.  I didn't want her to see it, so I ran around the neighborhood and bought all the copies I could find.
Good to see you too! <+++++> How you doing?
The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed. <+++++> I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common with. You know what I mean? <+++++> Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.
Oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now! You can slip it under my door. <+++++> No-no, it's not that, it's just I-I just moved in.
I can see why, nice shirt! <+++++> You're wearing the same shirt.
Well that was umm Okay. <+++++> It wasn 't the best.
Hey! <+++++> So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.
Well, I can't give you a massage, because my licence has been revoked again! <+++++> Phoebe, what happened?
Did you just break the radiator? <+++++> No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is.
Come on, show me. <+++++> All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
Hey Ross, what 's going on? You changing the lock? <+++++> No. That guy is.
Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare. <+++++> Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell or smoke.  Anyway, I was looking through it and I found "Science Boy" <+++++> Oh my god.  I never thought I'd see this again.  It's all here. What made you save it all these years?
Oh yeah? Did he pull the old <+++++> That 's right! That's right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
Bed? <+++++> No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way , of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.
Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol! <+++++> Uh okay, well there 's-there's wine in the kitchen.
Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair? <+++++> S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?
Oh wow! What now Ross you 're not gonna talk? How on earth will you ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know.  I mean you'd think the damn jalepeno would've cleared up your sinuses, but no!! That's not enough  What are you doing?! <+++++> I 'm getting that baby out of you!
Hello, Sir. You're here to return those pants? <+++++> No, these are my pants.
Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here. <+++++> He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
What?! <+++++> You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book! <+++++> Your make-up!
We were surprise that we weren 't invited. <+++++> No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.
Oh my God Ross!! <+++++> You like it?
There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course. <+++++> Come on.
Oh. Y 'know, he hums while he does other stuff to. <+++++> Yeah, were better off without them.
You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to the airport. <+++++> Okay, guys, wish me luck.
Hi. <+++++> Hi.
Yes. <+++++> All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack.
I don't know, I'm very tired. <+++++> So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.
Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart? <+++++> Hey, I might!
Huh! Where is the dog?! <+++++> What dog? There-there's no dog here.
Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that? <+++++> Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!
Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me. <+++++> Rach, she's not going to remember this.
Umm, yeah, actually, Susan 's gonna be home any minute, it's kinda an anniversary. <+++++> Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
And you know, I have a massage client soon. <+++++> You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?
Ahh. <+++++> What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?
That's because he's on your neck. <+++++> Well...  Whaa... aaah... aaahhh...
No dude, Ross tore up the tickets! <+++++> I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?
Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi! <+++++> Mitzi is.....
I 'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt. <+++++> Everything? Even the TV?
Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there! <+++++> C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!
Nooo! <+++++> Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
A thousand bucks. <+++++> ON A CAT??!!!!
No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything. <+++++> I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'
Yeah, definitely. <+++++> What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!
Hey, sweetums. <+++++> Hello to the rest.
All right. <+++++> Thank you, thank you.
Actually what? <+++++> well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma would go to my parents.
I can 't. I can't push anymore, I can't. <+++++> Sweetie you 're doing great.
Ross, sweetheart! <+++++> Oh, hey Aunt Millie.
Well, y 'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea. <+++++> Excuse me?
I love you too. <+++++> Uh Joey...
Sure. <+++++> Yeah?
Oh, are you sure you're ok? <+++++> Yeah.
Ohhh! <+++++> Why are we in bed together?
Hi! <+++++> Hi.  It 's nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don't anymore.
Well better than you, but y 'know still not what you want. <+++++> Oh?
Ross, she 's gonna start getting ready soon! <+++++> Well, can 't you at least stall her a little? I'll-I'll go back to some of the places I went last night.
Oh my God! You do a great Chandler! <+++++> Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions.
It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine. <+++++> Really?!
Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me! <+++++> Y 'know what? I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later. Good-bye.  Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you're just using me.
We used them as pillows when we went camping. <+++++> What?
I don 't know Ross! I-I tell you what, let's flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right? <+++++> Oh, all right.  Tails!  Can you-can you see what it is?
I will. <+++++> Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?
Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition! <+++++> Really? That's great!
Yep! You got the tickets? <+++++> Oh! Got  'em right here,  check!
Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol. <+++++> I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think.
Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan. <+++++> Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
Hey, what time is it? <+++++> 2
Once!! <+++++> All right, we 're gonna play.
Well, her memory is pretty much gone. <+++++> All right then.
...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!!   Thank you, thanks. <+++++> Hey, here 's a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?
Meeting Julie. <+++++> Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing. OK so you uh, and now wha... and now, now, now you're over me?
Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual... <+++++> Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.
Oh, thank goodness! <+++++> Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily.
Oh, we 're supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us! <+++++> Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y 'know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
Ohh!! <+++++> My apothecary table!!!
Hey! <+++++> Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.
Yeah. <+++++> Okay. Hut! Hike!
What Oh! <+++++> No! No, you know what?  You
Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job. <+++++> You can totally, totally live on this.
Good. Maybe he can switch it back. <+++++> Maybe not.
Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you. <+++++> Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.
Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring. <+++++> You told her before you told us?
Well, it didn't say  "This is a virus"!! <+++++> What did it say?
This is how I would hold a football. <+++++> Ok, here, here. There we go.
No he 's not! He's totally yanking your chain! He's done this with three other teachers! <+++++> What?
I 'm sorry, is this the same Rachel who's name you said at the altar in the second marriage? <+++++> Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.
Hey! <+++++> Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.
What?! <+++++> Unagi. I 'm always aware.
There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind. <+++++> That said it was my sandwich?!
There. Here's their card. <+++++> Thanks.  Hey, I know where this place is! It used to be an X-rated video...  florist.
Yeah, I guess that's true. <+++++> And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.
Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it. <+++++> Ok.  B - O - S ...
Really? Even more humiliating than <+++++> Hey, let's not do this!
I 'm on it! <+++++> I can 't believe this! I shouldn't be the one making her throw up!
Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment. <+++++> Look, I didn 't want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didn't want to either. But I don't, I don't understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?
What?! <+++++> You complete me kitchen, matey!
Kills you? <+++++> No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.
Hi Ginger. <+++++> All right! I want my key back!
Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times?? <+++++> Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
Well, she 'll understand right? It's not like I did it on purpose. <+++++> Dad that won 't matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me. <+++++> What?
There is not one hair on that head. <+++++> Hey, it 'll grow back, right? And she-she's really fun, and she's cool, and-and I'm finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel was so , y'know? Y'know, and I'm finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her, and-and-and it doesn't work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that again?
You can 't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So... <+++++> Ewwww!!
I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh. <+++++> OK. Hold my board.
No, she's out shopping. <+++++> Damn!
Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be. <+++++> No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.
What? <+++++> I played bad on purpose guys.
I lent them to Ross. <+++++> I gave them to Joey.
No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can 't! I can't do it!  It's just gonna freak me out!!! <+++++> Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I 'll-I'll tell her tonight I can't see her anymore.
I could not have done this without you. <+++++> Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer?  I'm fine, I'm fine.
If that doesn 't keep kids in school, what will? <+++++> And so now you guys are gonna be married?
Oh, well, she 's asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her. <+++++> Ok.
Yeah. But a part of me also can 't wait 'til it's over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding. <+++++> A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
Ross, can I talk to you for a minute? <+++++> Yes, please!  So, what's going on?
But I... <+++++> No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go.
Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine? <+++++> Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go  "ba dum bum chessh"
OK, gook luck. <+++++> Wha, uhh, what?
Oh, it 's awkward. It's awkward. It's awkward. <+++++> I sort 've already asked Chandler.
Yes. <+++++> Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
I 'd love some juice. Thanks. <+++++> Okay.  Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?
Sure, sure.  What's with the chair. <+++++> Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so...
Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian. <+++++> You see Amanda and I have a very special...
Wow, Carol really messed you up! <+++++> Excuse me?
Okay. I -But I think we should still have this conversation. <+++++> Really?! I mean, even with the card?
Hey. <+++++> Hi.
Because, I can 't! Ross, I told you, no. I can't. <+++++> This is my wedding.
First of all, it's on your ass. <+++++> Well then, what is it?!
I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry. <+++++> Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.
It's allright! Crying is good. It lets the boo-hoos out. <+++++> Here come some more...
Okay Ross that 's fine, but can you please stand near my head? <+++++> What? Oh yeah.  I 'm sorry. I mean I-I think I went a little crazy. I mean I was thinking about myself when I  really-I should have been thinking about you Rach
Oh no. No-no-no, don 't do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music. <+++++> Yeah, okay.
Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help. <+++++> No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help.
And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offered to help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you know out of nowhere Ross comes on to me. <+++++> Umm that 's that's a little misleading.
Oh, wait Ross! I 'm sorry, one more thing! <+++++> Yeah!
All right now All right, you 're all set up. You're good to go. Just hit record. All right? <+++++> Thanks.
I understand that would be difficult. <+++++> Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?
Like what? <+++++> Well I don 't know umm,  what if we were too tie each other up?  Umm, some people eat stuff off one another.  Nah! Umm, y'know we-we could try dirty talk?  Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks. <+++++> Do you wanna start telling secrets?
I beg your pardon? <+++++> No! No! Not -I don't mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, who's umm six and I still think of him as a baby.
All I say is, she better get the job. <+++++> Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair.  All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts. <+++++> I didn't.
I see. Have you considered therapy? <+++++> I think just the annulment for today.
See that is the problem with invisible dentists. <+++++> Why? Why can 't you go to him?
Thank you.  Well, I guess we have some time to kill. <+++++> Yeah, guess so. Whew! Check these out!  Never done this before.
Maureen Rosilla. <+++++> Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.
Yeah right. <+++++> It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex- wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.
No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin! <+++++> Your what?
Hi officer, was I going a little too fast? <+++++> Oh my God.
You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers! <+++++> All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!
Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so <+++++> Oh, I know.  Y 'know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda
Oh, that's um, interesting. <+++++> No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.
It 's okay honey, you'll find a name. <+++++> Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going to be.
Oh, Monica, grow up! <+++++> Hey, what's behind your back?
yeah-yeah-yeah!! <+++++> Oh-oh, okay, okay!  If you don't mind I'm gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt.  You have a pleasant evening.
Hey! <+++++> So, what do you want to do tonight? There 's a Ukrainian film at the Angelica that's supposed to be very powerful. Interested?
That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me! <+++++> Hey!
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Ross? <+++++> I'm hurt.
Did you not hear the plot of the movie?  "She's been dead for ten years." I'm gonna be a millionaire! <+++++> Hey!
Yeah, there was. It was -there the corner of the library where- where all these dusty books that nobody ever read-Yes, there was. <+++++> Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it 's like uh-a thing!
Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this? <+++++> Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll see if she wants to come back.
During a blackout? He'd get trampled! <+++++> Yeah?
Yeah, I didn't know that. <+++++> And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
Oh yeah, there-there she is! <+++++> Yeah, yeah, she's here.
No luck huh? <+++++> Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.
This is all of your things. <+++++> Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's -Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.
Ohh, that 's too bad! <+++++> No, I-I 'm saying I liked her.
Bye! <+++++> Bye!
So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? <+++++> Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
Do I know why we 're rushing? <+++++> Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?  Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do. <+++++> Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot.
Oh please. <+++++> Oh, oh there go the clothes.
He doesn't do much, does he? <+++++> No, this is pretty much it.
Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah! <+++++> We were all pretty shaken up about it.
Sure, I know lots of girls. <+++++> Yeah? Any names come to mind?
I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it. <+++++> Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.
I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist. <+++++> Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.
Oh you went to the movies by yourself? <+++++> No I -Mona!
You were right. <+++++> Rachel. Rachel Rachel.  I love you the most.
Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father 's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks! <+++++> Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
Oh Ross. <+++++> But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.
Why would I be mad? <+++++> Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex- girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.
I'm so sorry. <+++++> I really thought she'd stay.
Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country. <+++++> With such a sad history.
Do you know why? <+++++> I dunno, maybe it 's because you're really sarcastic. Or maybe it's cause you uh-
I know. <+++++> Hey! Everyone.
Yeah? What did ya have? <+++++> Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard
Whoa! And the...  huh-huh? <+++++> Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...
You did not go! <+++++> Come on.
What? <+++++> I was saving you.
I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet. <+++++> Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless . <+++++> It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?
My mother 's still alive. <+++++> Oh, thank God!
Come on, Chandler. <+++++> All right.  Okay, here we go!
H-Hi!! And you are...? <+++++> Ross? I... I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together last year... I had a baby with your sister!
I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry. <+++++> Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
It's fine. <+++++> No, but, your-your mad.
Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it!! <+++++> Think he washed his hands?
Honey I can 't even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I don't want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you're still his friend. <+++++> Okay. Okay, I 'll talk to him.
What?! <+++++> Nevermind.
Well, we did a little more than that. <+++++> No-no! No-no. No-no.
Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi! <+++++> Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?
Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you! <+++++> You still love me?
This is amazing. <+++++> I know.
Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody. <+++++> Hi. Hi.
Yeah, for you. Is that the list? <+++++> Um, yeah.
I can't watch this. <+++++> 
What!? <+++++> Well, I 'm just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.
Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready? <+++++> I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension.
No, did we miss it? <+++++> No, no, no. That's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.
Oh! <+++++> Oh there you go!
What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby? <+++++> Yeah, I mean, all things that guy...  These are amazing!
All right Ross you 're in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem? <+++++> The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh, I 'll take another question.
But-but this block is like a whole other world. <+++++> Y 'know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system.  Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep!
Oh, please tell me it 's not because I'm going with Mark. <+++++> Oh, well...
I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving. <+++++> Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
Wow! She looks great. Doesn 't she? <+++++> Yeah.
Ross! How could you do that to an old man?! <+++++> Excuse me ladies.  I 'm sorry?
We're not gonna talk about girth are we? <+++++> Nooo!
What? <+++++> The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!
It's a little complicated. <+++++> A little.
Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him? <+++++> Yeah! Right!
Mmm. <+++++> So how'd it go?
Hang in there, it's gonna happen. <+++++> Wha, OK, now how do you know that?
That's funny, we were doing the same thing! <+++++> Yeah!
Ugh! Women! <+++++> I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman,  "So, where is this going?"
Mrs. Geller? <+++++> She looks so small.
What? <+++++> What?
I totally don 't know what you're talking about. <+++++> Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!
I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away! <+++++> No, please, please, um, it 's for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.
And? <+++++> And it 'll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with? <+++++> Yeah!
You have to go to London! <+++++> What?
Alright Mr. Geller! Right this way! So, how dark do you wanna be? We have one, two or three. <+++++> Well... I like how you look, what are you?
Not even on page 7? <+++++> Oh yeah! You're -hey, you're right! Here's an affordable place,  two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!
Oh God, I can't believe you're making such a big deal about this. It was one kiss, one guy, one time! <+++++> Oh, really!
You wanna be in charge of the food committee? <+++++> Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?
My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting. <+++++> Yeah.
She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually. <+++++> Are you kidding? Oh my God...
Wow! This place is beautiful! <+++++> Look at all these paleontologists!!
I don 't have it! <+++++> It 's right there!
No, we didn 't get married! That's ridiculous! <+++++> We-we-we -I remember being in a chapel.
You wear bi-focals? <+++++> Um-hmm.
Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That 's called a scrum, okay? It's kinda like a huddle. <+++++> And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?
Yes... <+++++> Ah....
But! Don 't you have to give him his money back? <+++++> Uh-huh.  Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you.  Okay, let 's go see Monica!
No it 's not, it's second. <+++++> Wow!
....yeah... what else? <+++++> That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation.
How are you doing? <+++++> Okay. Okay. I mean I 'll be okay. It's just I don't think I handled it very well.
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too. <+++++> My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this.   You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!
Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy. <+++++> Ohh.
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me! <+++++> You're right, you're right, it is.
Yeah. What time are you meeting her? <+++++> We have 8
Y 'know, bonus night. Y'know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night. <+++++> One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?
I can 't! It's too late! Terry already hired that girl over there.  Look at her, she's even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin....  swans. <+++++> That word was swans.
You seem to really like her. <+++++> Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y 'know no commitment.
Space cowboy! <+++++> Correct! What is Chandler Bing 's job?
Ross, your little creature's got the remote again. <+++++> Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...
Come on, I don't know what else to do. <+++++> Fine, fine.  We'll have fun, won't we? Yes, we will, yes we will.
Ross, why don 't you give us your toast now? <+++++> Oh, no, Mom, it 's just Monica this year.
Ross! <+++++> Oh, nothin ' much. Just trying to figure out what I'm gonna do for dinner.
Yes, while I was in the chair! That 's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives! <+++++> Pheebs, come on, you didn 't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence.
Hey, c'mon, cut it out. <+++++> Hey?
So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories?  No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? <+++++> Okay! Okay.  Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you.  What do you say... want to waste another buck? <+++++> No, not this time.  So... what'd you have?
He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret. <+++++> Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?
Okay, I'm ready. <+++++> Oh, aaaah!
What? <+++++> What're you talkin' about?
It's ok that's how you feel. <+++++> But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have so much fun and you love Mike.
Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor? <+++++> I am a doctor! Y 'know what? I'm just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.
Okay. <+++++> I just found out that Elizabeth 's dad wants to meet me.
Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs. <+++++> There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.
How-how about you each get five vetoes? <+++++> All right.
Well, that 's a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick. <+++++> It was a dry day.
Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha .  I'll see you tomorrow. <+++++> Ok ...  Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have no problem.
Yeah, they're all he talks about, why? <+++++> How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. . I just heard it as you must have heard it and that 's not good. Let me start again. I'm a paleontologist, you'll be there with us and the touching refers only to bonesÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ fossils!
Yeah. Could you just sign right here please? <+++++> Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats.  Thank you! So what, you're just never going to tell her? <+++++> Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know, I'm going to take her to an amazing Valentine's dinner. Do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks I'm the best boyfriend in the world, then I'm going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.
I missed most of the party  Charlie's a girl, right? <+++++> Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did not kiss.
Yeah! I think that's great! <+++++> Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes Madeleines?
We were gonna go see the Jets! <+++++> You can't go, I mean you're the glue that holds this group together!
Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous. <+++++> I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.
Wow!  Well then I 'll just have to carry you. <+++++> That 'll be a neat trick, when you're,  when you're dead!
Wait, if that 's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it? <+++++> Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn 't want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can't.
Oh my God, how did you do that? <+++++> Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as  'Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, 'the munchies.' So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me
These are for Erica! <+++++> What? She's gonna eat all those cookies?
Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no. <+++++> Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
Pizza! <+++++> Oh, mine! Mine! Mine!  Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Monica. <+++++> Oh my God, he just said your name, that 's great! Good job Ben.
Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night? <+++++> That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful
Ross? <+++++> Huh?
Is that supportive? <+++++> Is this?!
Guys? <+++++> Over here.
11, unbelievable, 11 is correct. <+++++> Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl's breast?
What? <+++++> It was my first time.
Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon. <+++++> Ah, and where is Joey?
Yeah. <+++++> Good-bye.
A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants. <+++++> Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
Really? <+++++> Yeah?
Okay. <+++++> He is so weird.
I wrote you a letter. <+++++> Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
Yeah. <+++++> Just one thing umm
Well, maybe I can help. <+++++> Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do that again...
Well, because of us! Because of our history. <+++++> No!
What? You don't want me to get a job? <+++++> Oh yeah, I'm sure he's gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary.
Heeeeey, where have you been?  What happened to you? <+++++> Ah I had a little thing with Joey, if you think this is bad you should see him.
Y 'know how the garage floods every Spring? <+++++> How are you ever going to sell this place?
Your mother's right. Take her, you can wear my tux. <+++++> Dad, she won't want to go with me.
Guess what? <+++++> You got a job?
Agghhh. <+++++> So were you in Nam?
Oh no! <+++++> You slept with my sister?
Sure. <+++++> Naa.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
You remember that video I found of mom and dad? <+++++> Yeah.
The museum was amazing! <+++++> Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?
Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number. <+++++> Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?
It's not cooler. <+++++> Yeah I just hurt it.
No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are. <+++++> Is that so?
Thank you. <+++++> All right, let 's go! Bye, Pheebs!
No? <+++++> No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?
Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel. <+++++> So, what? That's it?
Look, look! <+++++> Hey, what 's this?!
What?! <+++++> Okay, break-up 's still on!
Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good- bye! <+++++> No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!
So bad. <+++++> So bad.
Oh honey thank God you 're home, I was getting worried. <+++++> I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I 've already signed everything and I put little 'X's where you need to sign.
18, uh? <+++++> Joey, NO!
No I didn 't! <+++++> Are you sure?
Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch. <+++++> Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead.
Duly noted. <+++++> Thanks.   Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
Ross, um, don 't forget to get a shot of Emma's cake. It's in a box in the fridge. <+++++> Sure.
Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK. <+++++> I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.
No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish. <+++++> Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.
Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars. <+++++> Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
No! No! I-I meant for the baby! <+++++> Oh. What 's wrong with Ross?
Really? <+++++> I 'm telling you.
Uh, yeah, if you want too. <+++++> Do you want me too?
Yes! Green-blue! <+++++> Well go! Go move it!
All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing 's right. And that's what deathbeds are for. <+++++> Yeah, okay.
In a month? <+++++> Yeah!
How crazy that we 'd run into you! <+++++> Oh God, thank you!  Umm, uh, Mr. Stevens I 'd like you to meet my friends uh, this is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.
Hey! <+++++> Hey! Are you ready yet?
How much longer? <+++++> A-A day.
Oh my God, has she slept at all? <+++++> Nope.
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy. <+++++> Hey! Hi!
Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year,  "Dear Rach, you're such a good person." Not girl! Person! <+++++> Rach, I think you 're reading a little too much into it.
What? <+++++> I don't! I wanna be with her.
Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing. It was amazing. It was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that... <+++++> Oh I know, isn't it? Ooh... what'd you do to get her to laugh?
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry, it's just that when you moved your hands down to my butt, it was like woah, Ross's hands are on my butt. Sorry. <+++++> And that's, that's funny why?
Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful. <+++++> Woah. Woah... <nearly really drops the plate and more seriously> Woah.
You kissed. <+++++> Wha...  What? What would give you that idea?
This place is awesome! <+++++> You know, we should just go, I 'm not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!
Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out. <+++++> What about Emma? We don't have a nanny.
And the bunny got away. <+++++> This would be the place where you explain the hat.
Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen. <+++++> 
Okay, they're just talking... <+++++> Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
Yeah! <+++++> Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?
He 's fine! <+++++> Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard 's son, you'd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.
Set....hike! <+++++> One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!
You don't trust him? <+++++> Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the  "hot nanny".
Chip, is Chip Matthews. <+++++> The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table? <+++++> Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.
You were incredible! <+++++> Yeah?
Don 't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this. <+++++> I 'll tell you what Mon, I'll give you the first box for free.
Oh, you're so screwed. <+++++> Hey. What was that all about?
Ohh! Okay! <+++++> Come on!
WHAT! <+++++> umm. that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named Vicrum.
Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign. <+++++> Still doing the screening thing?
So, thank you for the delicious dinner. <+++++> You're welcome for a delicious dinner.
All right, look I 'm sorry you guys, but it's just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they're really expensive, y'know? I'm down to like three! Well, actually two 'cause one of 'em I kinda blackened in some teeth-Why did I do that?! <+++++> Well isn 't there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can't-can't you pick up, I don't know, an extra shift here?
No!! <+++++> Come on you guys, it's no big deal!
Are you going to do it? <+++++> I'm going to do it.
Oh Amy, don't cry Amy. <+++++> Sure, you want to go upstairs?
You already hit on me an hour ago <+++++> Right, so that's a firm "no". I cannot believe this, I just keep striking out.
Okay. <+++++> So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing....
I'm comin' out! <+++++> And she's supposed to buy this?!
Yeah, I know but <+++++> Oh no-no-no, I 'm there.
I'm gonna take her back to the appartment. <+++++> Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you \- wovyou dovyou ...
Okay well I think that's your answer. <+++++> I 've got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.
Sorry!!  I just feel bad about all that sleep you 're gonna miss wishing you were with me! <+++++> Oh, no-no-no don 't you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!
I brought you back a present. <+++++> Wha-? Oh, come on. You didn't have to-saltwater taffy?!  Thanks! This is interesting. You know, most people think this is made with sea water, but it's actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. That's not interesting.
Is this about me taking your watch? <+++++> You took my watch?
Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl. <+++++> Well
No-no-don 't! Don't leave me here with these people. <+++++> Oh uh, I 'm sorry.
That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are. <+++++> Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?
You did. <+++++> What?! Hello! We didn 't get married.
You can tell us. <+++++> Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine.
Because, he 's my friend. <+++++> Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...
He should take the sack? <+++++> Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.
A big idiot. <+++++> A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.
Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag? <+++++> Five.
Hey-hey, Ross? <+++++> Yeah.
What do you mean? You've been in my room before! <+++++> Yeah, sure, right! Like I've ever been in Rachel Green's room.
Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! <+++++> My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-
Okay, okay, yes, it is.  How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. <+++++> Hi.
I thought I had to make the jokes! <+++++> Don't you have to be at work?
Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex! <+++++> Phoebe he 's right, that is the rule.
Hey, y 'know what? I'm not waiting! I'm gonna push this baby out! I'm doing it! I mean it's what? Three centimeters? That's gotta be like this! <+++++> Actually it 's more like this.
I just can't stand you being here all the time. <+++++> Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're just havin' fun.
No, I have some turning 21 to do. <+++++> Y 'know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to
Nooo!! <+++++> Yeah!!
What-wh-what so we 'll just stay married forever?! <+++++> Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It 's right next to it!
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it. <+++++> Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
Yeah, looks that way. First ones here! Wooo!! <+++++> Yay!!
Hey. <+++++> Hey.
Is Monica here? <+++++> No.
You told them he was missing? <+++++> No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I 'm interested in them.
She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross! <+++++> That 's all you're basing this on?
Thank you, thank you very much! <+++++> Let's celebrate with some maple candy!
Oh, let me see!  Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over! <+++++> That would be nice.
Why? <+++++> I just wanna check something.
Yeah? <+++++> Never mind.
Just come. <+++++> Oh my God!
Yeah! <+++++> And um...You look nice today.
Sure will. I've uh, gotta go. Take care. <+++++> OK, see ya later, nice meeting you.
Oh, yeah! <+++++> Wow!
Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see. <+++++> What's wrong with people having sex?
I guess I wanted to keep it  as a souvenir. <+++++> My God Monica!!
Well I mean, let me get the door first.  Oh, hi! No one. <+++++> Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
No. <+++++> What?
Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat! <+++++> That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.
Are you still mad at us? <+++++> Yep.
So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve 's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, 'Doctor Monkey?' And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. <+++++> Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I 'm a doctor, and I had a monkey. I'm Doctor Monkey!
Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up with me. And besides, he's a very ethical man. <+++++> Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of  "Underdog"?
So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together? <+++++> Oh, I.. I don't know. We didn't really get to talk.
We're having a girl? <+++++> No.
Fine! All right, I 'll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y'know, start to say something stupid. <+++++> Just then or-or all the time,  'cause we-we have jobs y'know.
Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman? <+++++> He's a brilliant diagnostician!
Oh, you can have an accent and I can 't?!  Top 'O the morning to ya laddies! <+++++> Just please stop!
Oh! Oh, I'm so happy. <+++++> Then I'm happy too.
Really? Why not? <+++++> Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don 't know if we're really quite there yet.
Oh, I 'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else? <+++++> We were on a break!
That 's the best one! Oh my God,  thank you so much! <+++++> Well. Hey

That is brand new information!! <+++++> You already know don 't you?
Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild. <+++++> This screen is amazing, I mean Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.
All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area. <+++++> Can we please focus here, a naked man 's life hangs in the balance!
All right, we 'll start with apples. <+++++> We 'll be starting with apples.

Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo... <+++++> You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..
What are doing? You know I can only dish it out! <+++++> I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me
I'd rather not. <+++++> Oh, yeah, why not?

Oh, it went amazingly well! <+++++> Great!
Who 's next? <+++++> Hi there!
Ross, nice to meet you. <+++++> Yeah, a real pleasure.
I 'll always remember that summer, because it's when I got all of these freckles. <+++++> Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I 'll always remember that summer because that's when I realized that we are related.
Yes! Yes, you 're back in the lead! <+++++> I 'd like to spin the wheel!
You are right there with Emily. And it 's y'know, it's kinda like . it's a tie! Well, I gotta get, I gotta get back to the dishes. <+++++> I gotta get to work.
Yes, yes Monica is thin. It's wonderful. But what we really want to hear about is Ross's new girlfriend. <+++++> Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!
So, are you a member of any gym. <+++++> No! And I 'm not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.
Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital! <+++++> What? No, no! Hey, hey, hey look...
Wh <+++++> But I didn 't want to.
Okay.. <+++++> Oh! That was Lambchop!
What?! You say that to kids?!! <+++++> No! No! No! The  "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
And you're okay with that? <+++++> I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
No. No. But I 'll go see a normal person movie with ya. <+++++> Rach? You wanna come?
Vicrum? <+++++> WHAT THAT'S A REAL NAME!
Just tell her the truth! Tell her you 're not ready. <+++++> I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding? <+++++> Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.
Looks like someone IS the ladies!! <+++++> You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me  I have a date.  See?  ALL eyes on ME!
Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me. <+++++> Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
I always loved that!! <+++++> Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!!  Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God!
Oh! <+++++> I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.
Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself. <+++++> This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.
Oh, they're real! <+++++> Did she  do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her!
I 'm sorry. <+++++> Seven years. I mean we 've been together seven years, she's the only woman who's ever loved me, and the only woman I've-I've ever....
I like Ross. <+++++> Ohhh! Kids!
She won a thousand dollars! <+++++> So this is an annual thing?
I call Godfather! <+++++> You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today. <+++++> You do, huh?
Honey see, it doesn 't mean that I don't love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it's-it's for me y'know, I'm out there, on my own, and I'm doing it and it's scary but I love it, because it's mine. I, but, I mean is that okay? <+++++> Sure, I-I-I...
You're not gonna like it. <+++++> That's okay.
Wait, I 'm-I'm sorry. What's the big deal about a holiday card? <+++++> Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!
Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh! <+++++> Rach!
Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning. <+++++> No problem.
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy. <+++++> Oh Mon, I laughed so hard
Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you! <+++++> You still love me?
I think it's sweet. <+++++> Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma.
Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good. <+++++> I know, I know, it's, it's almost...
A guy who won two. <+++++> Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart
Hi. <+++++> We 'd like to close our accounts.
Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed. <+++++> You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.
This is the boarding call for Flight 009. <+++++> Emily!
Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door? <+++++> You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.
Oh, you 're not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back! <+++++> Nooo!
Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as you want. <+++++> Yeah, I need uh I 'm just-I don't know-I don't understand, umm, how this happened? We-we used a condom.
You be okay? <+++++> Yeah.
Just get away from me! <+++++> No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
Okay guys, way to wish me luck! <+++++> Good luck! Go get 'em!
Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani! <+++++> So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!
Well, that would 've been very hard to say no too. <+++++> It 's a good thing I didn't do it, because it sounds like it would've been a very expensive wedding.  Okay, good night
Oh... Yeah, you do. <+++++> 'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike! <+++++> So, what did you decide?
Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little. <+++++> What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
That's how they do pants! <+++++> Yes, yes it is. In prison!
Yes! Yes! You did! <+++++> Oh
No. <+++++> Okay, it must just be me then.
Oh, y'know what? Forget it, you already gave me an A. <+++++> Gotcha.
Chocolate-chip pancakes! <+++++> We 've got presents!
Nope, nope, that's it. <+++++> Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part.  Helloo!
Yeah. <+++++> Okay, well, that Wow, okay, well, umm then maybe, at least we can, we can talk about us again.
Oh my God! I 'm going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can't make lunch. <+++++> So apparently I 'm available for lunch.
Can I talk to you for a second?! <+++++> Hey, Joey.
Yeah! <+++++> Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah! Boys will be boys?
Yay! <+++++> There you go.
No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa! <+++++> Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
What? <+++++> I think I might know what this is about.
Actually I did it Ross. You remembered shockingly little of your own speech. <+++++> Yes, but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products. This is amazing, thank you, thank you so much.  That's a pretty necklace.
We're ok. <+++++> Alright.
And I 'm Rachel, an admirer of the building. <+++++> I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I 'm so sorry for your loss.
Listen Ross, you don 't have to apologize. I understand why you were there. <+++++> You do?
They all had a thing for him. <+++++> Aw, Mom...
Yeah, but not as good as batch 17. <+++++> Which one was that?
You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't? <+++++> No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...
Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done! <+++++> It 's no surprise that your winning, 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.
No! We 're gonna have fun. We can make fudge! <+++++> Pity food? Y'know what that 's okay, all right, I don't need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.
Ohh wow! I 'm sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes! <+++++> Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
Oh, well get in line missy.  So, can I have a ride stud? <+++++> Hop in.  Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine. <+++++> You did so. I swear, I swear - How long has she been in the bathroom?
Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party? <+++++> I don 't know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there's this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.
Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room. <+++++> Mhm,  packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.
Ohh, okay.  Wh-Ah-ha!  Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can't do it. <+++++> What?
No, I think it 's very obvious who's wrong here. <+++++> Obviously not to Joey.
God she is unbelievable. <+++++> I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.
Hi, sure! <+++++> Hi.
But, it's not raining. <+++++> I can't catch a break!
Oh. Well good!  For me.  What is this? Did you give yourself a facial? <+++++> I have an oily T-zone!
Hey you guys? <+++++> What?
What do you mean? <+++++> It 's just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan 's, it's like-It breaks my heart a little. I mean I've always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y'know? Maybe fight over the science section.
Wait! Where 's my shoes? <+++++> You, you sure you need shoes?  Okay.
I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window. <+++++> Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.
Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy? <+++++> No, of course not!  ...Yeah, yeah, it is.
This may surprise you, but re-hiring fired employees, is not my main job. <+++++> Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise?
You bitch. You just think you're so perfect. With your new baby and your, your small apartment.  <directs this to Ross who in turns throws the towel in his hand down on the table> Well let me tell you something. Your baby isn't even that cute. <+++++> Too far, Amy. Too far.
Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night? <+++++> Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?
Well, Chandler and I used to make out! A lot! <+++++> You did?
So, I love you. <+++++> I love you.
Oh, I 'm sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney? <+++++> Well maybe she wouldn 't have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!
My father had an heart attack...  ...while I was at Barney's. <+++++> Oh my God.
I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment? <+++++> Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?
Oh my God! Is that him? <+++++> That is an old, Chinese woman!
...He's in. <+++++> He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
What?! <+++++> Forget it.
Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica 's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks. <+++++> You think?
Hey! <+++++> What are you guys doing later?
Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute! <+++++> And smart!
And well, what did she say? <+++++> Thank you.
Why? <+++++> Rain? Hi. Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat.
Irrational, huh? All right, well, I 'll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment! <+++++> Oh, yeah, that 's the same, I am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings!
Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are! <+++++> Hey!
Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend? <+++++> No, but it 'd be nice if you realised, it's just a job!
Oh, uhm, excuse me, I'm here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green. <+++++> And I'm Doctor Ross Geller.
Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live! <+++++> Joey, uh- OM nipotent.
Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross, this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia. <+++++> No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.
Hey! Where have you been? <+++++> Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Hey all right, Ross came as doody. <+++++> No, I-I 'm not doody.
I know <+++++> What was wrong with Mona?
I do. I really do. I don 't know anything. <+++++> I 'm-I'm sure that's not true.
Excuse me. . That didn't make us sound gay at all! <+++++> You broke the pact!
Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he 'd ever heard. <+++++> Hey, tell Dan,  'Thanks.'
Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it 's been twelve years. <+++++> Can I see you for a second?
Uhh, Chandler's not here. <+++++> Well, you can help me!
Okay, everything looks good. Here it is on the screen.  Here is your uterus. And right here is your baby. <+++++> Oh my God.
Well, you could actually go to the gym. <+++++> Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
Now wasn 't Joey hitting on her at the wedding too? <+++++> That 's right! He was hitting on her, and I got her. I guess the better man won.  Please don 't take her from me.
Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls. <+++++> Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you 're with me.
OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty. <+++++> I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five.
Oh that 's five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesn't she want to come out? <+++++> Y 'know what I think it is? I think you've made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn't want to leave.
I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference. <+++++> Hey.
Yeah. <+++++> You got it.
What? Who? <+++++> Phoebe.
Awful, absolutely awful. <+++++> What are you, what are you doing?
No, let me explain! Fired!! <+++++> All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy.
Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room! <+++++> Me too. Come here.
Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving. <+++++> Susan Sarandon.
Thanks. <+++++> Yeah, yeah, I was watching.  Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what- what-what would you do next?
Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there!  That was my agent.  My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie! <+++++> Oh my God! Whoah!
I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to. <+++++> Come on Chappy, do your business. MAKE! MA-AKE! I did not sign on for this.
Oh my God. <+++++> I know.
No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy. <+++++> How 'bout Ben?
Monica 's chicken parm! I'll take care of it.  Hey Mr. Treeger, it's Joey Tribbiani. Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandler's apartment. It's an emergency.  Uhh, gas leak! Yeah oh, and bring garlic bread. <+++++> Hey!
But Joey, I don 't think Ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. I mean--Or he does. <+++++> No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.
All right, uh  Oh hey, you 've done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows? <+++++> Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
Ohh, with who? <+++++> Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.
Totally. I had sex in High school... <+++++> Me too. I'm good at it.
No! Not at all! <+++++> Good! Me neither! So it 's not a problem. We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
I was just going to say that I left my keys. <+++++> Oh,  holy molly are we in a pickle now.
Who cares? Nobody reads those things <+++++> You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
So what's new with you, uh, knocked up any more of my daughters lately? <+++++> Nope, just the one. RACH!
What? <+++++> I 've never walked down the aisle knowing it can't end in divorce.
Okay, but this can 't be good for the baby. <+++++> Oh!
I got beer. <+++++> I got bottled breast milk.
Hey! <+++++> Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
Thank you. <+++++> Any time.
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress. <+++++> Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.
Dr. Geller, Kurt Rathman, I 'm a professor in the paleontology department here. <+++++> Oh.
I just wanted to come by and y 'know, wish you good luck on your date. <+++++> Oh thanks!
Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants? <+++++> Yeah!
Oh yeah, it 's beautiful country up there. <+++++> Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
Hey. <+++++> Hi. I-I hear you 're going on a ferry tonight.
I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her! <+++++> Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.
What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans? <+++++> No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...
OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs. <+++++> No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can't -you can't do...
Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway. <+++++> Oh, oh... maybe not you!
You obviously can't keep away from her. <+++++> Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with.
Hang on a second I just got in. <+++++> Look, I don't care it starts at eight, we can't be late.
Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the booth, and... <+++++> I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them all on my back.
Both of you? <+++++> Yep.
Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn 't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets. <+++++> You have to respect the sea!
As much as they love you? <+++++> I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It 's not my fault.
Correct! Which monarch has ruled Great Britain the longest? <+++++> Queen Victoria.
It could 've been worse, he could've shot her. <+++++> That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn 't it?
Whadja think? <+++++> ...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here. <+++++> Ow, ow, OK. Alright, alright, Mon, Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, alright.
Don't tear it. <+++++> Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers.
oh I dunno I dunno, you know I mean I like him but am I ready to take my grade a loins off the meat market. <+++++> you know I really admire your whole dating attitude, it's so healthy I'm always like is this moving to fast? Is this moving to slow? Where's this going?
Ross will do it. <+++++> Oh sure,  "Ross will do it!" It's not like he has a job, or a child, or a life of his own.
But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle, y 'know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out. <+++++> I love when you talk dirty to me.
Whoa, how do you know about that? <+++++> Because he called here looking for you. So don't tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,
Thank you.  Oww!!!! God! <+++++> What?! I wh-, what 's wrong?
I 'm sorry, I do that. <+++++> Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then I'm joking! <+++++> No!
And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny. <+++++> They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right? <+++++> Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!
Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe. <+++++> Buddy, my monkey?
I didn't see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name. <+++++> I don't think so! You're just giving me Ruth so you'll get to name it when it's a boy, and that's when you'll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.
Okay. Okay. <+++++> Yes! Yes! Yes!!
Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay? <+++++> Pshhshhh!
Uh-uh-uh, right now? Because I 've kinda got an el fresco situation going on over here. <+++++> Please, please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today.
There you go! Keep going. Keep going! <+++++> I, er...
Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all. <+++++> A Play-Dough Barber Shop?
Okay, here 's batch 22. Ohh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg. <+++++> Let 's give it a shot.
Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened. <+++++> Thanks, man, big help.
I don't think mine likes me either. <+++++> Maybe it's a universal thing?
Just let her serve the beef-custard thing? <+++++> Yeah, it 'll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!
I can 't believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that! Thank you Ross. <+++++> Oh hey, don 't thank me, thank yourself. You're the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me? <+++++> I was thinkin' about it.
I certainly see what the girls like coming here. <+++++> Why?!
Good idea! Yes! <+++++> It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street. <+++++> So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?
Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go!   You didn't get the annulment?!! <+++++> I know.
It's mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like "yeah, right, well what else is new?" <+++++> Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, I've got to go. I've got Lamaze class.
If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They 've been taping those people up there all day. <+++++> Right.
Oh, so you 're already doing your part for the kids. <+++++> I 'm sorry, it's just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp-to be a counselor!
You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man. <+++++> Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
Wow! Look at this!  I can 't believe I even fit into this shirt!   Oh, this is yours. <+++++> Oh, I don 't know how that got in there.
I didn 't have to, because I was wearing my 'I heart Ross' sandwich board and ringing my bell. <+++++> Uh-huh.
Yeah. <+++++> You okay?
So okay what? You 're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?!-Op, woman! Sorry. <+++++> Well, okay so, I don 't have it all worked out quite yet. Just don't say anything to Rachel, please?
No. <+++++> Oh, come on, now you know you want  'em.
Ok, careful, ok.  Oh, she 's smiling! Oh my God, she does like it! <+++++> See, I told you!
Wow.  Good speech. <+++++> Yeah, it really was!
Y 'know what? Let's, let's talk later. <+++++> No! No! I want to talk now! Okay? I -In fact,  I am going to talk to the president of the condom company!
And then my wife and I went on a cruise to the Galapagos. There was a sea food buffet you wouldn't believe. There were clams, and mussels, and oysters, and cracked crab, and snow crab, and king crab. It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish. <+++++> So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?
One hour. <+++++> Give me two.
I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. <+++++> Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
One uh, vegetarian pizza. That's $12.15. <+++++> Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like 8-year-old boys.
Ow...Oh Gosh! <+++++> 10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
Ugh, I hate this year! <+++++> What 's wrong with this year?
Boy that Julie's a talker, huh? <+++++> Goodnight.
You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed! <+++++> And you thought she was going to be in our way! So, why don't you, uh, open the champagne, and I'll be right back. I've got a surprise for you.
Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad. <+++++> That 's 'cause-'cause you're mom's dog kept-kept looking at me.
Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come. <+++++> Exactly!!
No, we went to the left. <+++++> Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.
Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man. <+++++> Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.
YAY! <+++++> Shhh!
I can 't believe you won't just admit it!  Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid. <+++++> Look, we 're just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?
Ohh. What is this? <+++++> No Phoebe, don 't look! You don't want to see what's under there!!
Yeah, what 's your point? <+++++> Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
Oh, yeah! Ooh, that 's nice. <+++++> Dude!
I confronted her, and she didn 't deny it!  I don't live here! <+++++> Chandler!
Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah.... <+++++> Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
Bye. <+++++> Bye.
Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie? <+++++> Oh yeah, why not?
How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free. <+++++> OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
No! I'm sorry, we were looking for  "Baby It's You". Baby It's You. <+++++> Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my questions have anything to do with Paleontology.
Little bit, yeah. <+++++> Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy.
Oh no, I think I 'm gonna go home and eat ten candy bars. <+++++> Hey, I thought I cheered you up.
Hey! <+++++> Hi!
Nope! <+++++> Huh? Ooh  you mean like a Huh?
Oh Emma. This is going to be your first Thanksgiving. What are you thankful for? Mommy's bobbies. <+++++> A lot of people are thankful for those.
I don 't want you to see me naked! <+++++> Rachel, I 've seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?
Ah, you... have the sex? <+++++> No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um...
Okay! I 'm ready. <+++++> You sure?
You 'd think that would embarrass me, but you see I'm maxed out. <+++++> Hey!
I 'm just going to say hi to the lads. All right? <+++++> All right.
And we 'll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind. <+++++> No problem.
Okay, stop what you 're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers..... <+++++> Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?
Oh b-b-but it is! <+++++> Oh, okay, y 'know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...
Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing? <+++++> Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I 'll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right. <+++++> Well Mr. Big Shot is better than  'wethead'.
I called him. <+++++> Nooo.
Mine! <+++++> Wait! It was my plan.
How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last? <+++++> I'm going to China.
Ross, can you pass me the yams? <+++++> Sure! Oh, and Joey 's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
You 're doing it again. <+++++> Excuse me.
Ross. <+++++> What? What?
Did she go out with him? <+++++> No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.
Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table. <+++++> What 's uh, what's going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?
Well... <+++++> I know!
All right, I know you 're hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but don't say that again. <+++++> Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he 'd be the stepfather of my child.
I know, but I don 't think that's what she wants. <+++++> No, it 's not what I want either. I mean I-I can't force myself to fall in love with her again now.
All right I 'll have one. <+++++> So what 's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one.
Thank you so much for letting me do this. Public bathrooms freak me out, I can't even pee, let alone do <+++++> But, what's great is that you don't mind talking about it.
The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed. <+++++> This is the coolest house ever!!
It's your favorite sister. <+++++> Jill?
Well, yeah, this is the deal. <+++++> OK, well, um, have a nice evening.
Yes I am! <+++++> Rach!
Oh, this is it. This what 's gonna kill me. <+++++> " subcategories. The first of these subcategories is "
Oh, I I d- <+++++> Hey, whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me. Y'know, actually once-once I got dumped during sex.
Oh no! Oh no! <+++++> Okay! Okay! Fine, I 'll stop! No teaching, okay? We'll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky.  Okay? Who's official name is Bapstein-King.
Um, can I come back in? <+++++> Why?
So what are you gonna do? <+++++> What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your... <+++++> Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?
I don 't want them to move to a Volvo dealership! <+++++> It 'll be okay Joe.
You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you. <+++++> Why?
I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious. <+++++> Why are you laughing?
It got caught on my watch. <+++++> Hey!
Why don 't you get in the hot tub and I'll meet you there. <+++++> Ohh, okay.
What? <+++++> The card! I think we 're there!
What? <+++++> Hi.
So whose ring is it? <+++++> It 's mine.
Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled? <+++++> Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type "little", the idiot.
Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something? <+++++> Yeah.
I 'd be happy to.  You are very sweet. <+++++> Yes I-I am. In fact umm hey, why don 't we try it my special way? You can dance on my feet.
All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty. <+++++> Wow!
He is very sweet. Plus he's hot! <+++++> That was going to be my next argument.
Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what. <+++++> Huh?
All right!! <+++++> Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?
But, but, Mona, I live here. <+++++> Happy Valentine's Day!  Or something to remember me by.
Y'think? <+++++> Yeah!
What, so I gotta shut it down now? <+++++> All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.
Bye. <+++++> Bye.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
I can 't believe Mark didn't call. It's Sunday night, and he didn't call. <+++++> Bummer.
Popular. <+++++> With an aptitude for science.
'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that? <+++++> Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?
Well it 's gone. <+++++> What?! How 's that?
Marc Coreger, this is my wife Julie. <+++++> Hi Julie.
Triscadecaphobia. <+++++> The fear of Triscuts!
Ok. <+++++> No.
What are you doing here, Geller? <+++++> Well, I came with Rachel, who should be back any second!  So what's new?
What was all that about? <+++++> It was...This disagreement over... My god. You...you look beautiful.
Ross, if you don 't tell them, then I will! <+++++> Okay, fine!
Does, um, anyone wanna see? <+++++> Nooo!
No. <+++++> No, because your not upset.
Oh look, look there 's your old makeup kit! <+++++> It 's a clown kit! Clown kit!
Yeah. <+++++> You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
I've probably been talking too much. Why don't we talk about you a little bit? <+++++> Mmm-Unmm.
Uh, there's a drunk Chinese guy. <+++++> Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.
Oh wow. <+++++> Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
Ross! Come quickly! There 's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard! <+++++> I 've gotta go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
Shoot! I can 't go, I have to work! <+++++> That 's too bad.
Die Hard!!!!!! <+++++> Dude, you didn 't say Die Hard. Is everything okay?
I can 't speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship. <+++++> Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y 'know? Say-say they're coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they're laughing, y'know, someone innocently touches someone else There's electricity, it's new. It's exciting. Are you telling me there isn't even the slightest possibility of something happening?
Right. <+++++> Hey, what 'd you guys do to get up on there?
Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall. <+++++> What?
You spit on me man! <+++++> Look, I 'm sorry.
Oh, look, he's waking up! <+++++> hey, fella! How you doing?
So what are you gonna do? <+++++> You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?
All right. <+++++> Ohh!
My boyfriend canceled on me. I mean.. I I finally find a real relationship. I mean, someone that I can spend this day with and then his wife comes back into town. I swear, its almost not worth dating married guys. <+++++> Don't say that.
I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture. <+++++> Zoo dollars?
So, did you pick one yet? <+++++> No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought -it wasn't that funny. So I'm still torn.
You miss your girlfriend? <+++++> Just ignore them.
What? <+++++> Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh...
Oh-oh, what are you doing? <+++++> What am I doing?
It 'll be great for next weekend. <+++++> No, no, no, this weekend guys!
Twenty bucks says they're married within the month. <+++++> We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover.
fellas <+++++> Yeah!
Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number. <+++++> And she just gave you this?
Hi! <+++++> Hey!
What? <+++++> Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be happy for each other.
What is up? <+++++> About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.
Who invented bifocals? <+++++> Ben Franklin.
I don't know all the words. <+++++> I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's first words .
Aren 't you in my Popular Culture class? <+++++> That 's right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we're dating. And you may frown upon that, but we're not gonna hide it anymore.
Yes, we should. I think we should. <+++++> Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?
It 's All Relative. <+++++> Monica and I have a grandmother who died, you both went to her funeral, name that grandmother!
No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back. <+++++> Oh my God..
Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song. <+++++> Seriously?
What is it...?  Please...? <+++++> You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you.
I don 't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist. <+++++> I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
Great! Well, it was nice meeting all of you. <+++++> Yeah, you too.
Oh, come on! I think he 's ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk. <+++++> Really?!  Hey, y 'know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here's-here's 60 bucks, why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
What? <+++++> Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.
Are you okay, sweetie? <+++++> I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...
Hey Ross, look what I've got going here. <+++++> Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.
Is everything all right, dear? <+++++> Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.
What? <+++++> Peach pit.
Mhm-mh! <+++++> Haven't had sex in four months, I should get a medal for that!
Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last. <+++++> No.
Well, what did you say to her? <+++++> Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone.
What? <+++++> Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?
...Ross? <+++++> Yes?
Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it? <+++++> ....................Yeah.
Let's see! <+++++> That's fine, I'll just wait!
I know isn 't it? It's like I'm right there with Joshua. <+++++> Uh-huh.
Again?! <+++++> Yeah!!
And Monica knows... <+++++> Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul. <+++++> Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good. <+++++> Open it, open in.
Maybe. <+++++> But you already told me everything.
I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol. <+++++> No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!
Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year 's Eve 1997. <+++++> I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!
No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure! <+++++> Y 'know what? Actually I'm kinda glad they're leaving 'cause uh, I need to talk to you about something.
I just got off the phone with my sister. <+++++> Ah, which, which one?
Me? I 'm great! I'm fine! I'm sooo good!! But, you know who's not great?! Men! You're a man right Ross?! <+++++> Yeah.
Yeah. <+++++> Hello.
Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand. <+++++> Well, I 'd love to! Here, you wait right here and I'll go get the projector and my notes!
Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts. <+++++> Why did you hate me?
Oh... That's true. <+++++> Thank you!
You were? <+++++> Yeah, it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marc's Comics you know, I-I-I was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week-
Look, Ross, you have what you want, you 're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you. <+++++> Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you 're right. Yeah I guess I'll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth. <+++++> 15?  Your personal best!
Ross! <+++++> It was no big deal. We-we said that the rumor was that umm you had both male and female reproductive parts.
Fine! <+++++> I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.
If anything should happen to him <+++++> Joey! The vet said it 's a simple procedure.
Oh no problem, maybe I 'll play with my left hand. <+++++> You 're not a lefty?
Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff. <+++++> Huh.
Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself. <+++++> Rachel!!  Wow! You, uh, you look, wow!
You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron? <+++++> I didn't say we were brothers.
I'd wait. <+++++> You'd wait?
Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard!  Howard! Howard! Howard!  Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard!  Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Yay!! <+++++> Phoebe!
You were staring about eight inches south of there. <+++++> Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
Yeah, it 's not. But I'm rich and thin. <+++++> Oh! Man I don 't think I've seen you since uh, Lance Davis' graduation party.
Oh, you're back...  this is my wife, Nancy. <+++++> Get Out!
Hey Ross! Doesn 't Ben go to the Smithfield Day School? <+++++> Yeah. Why?
Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier... <+++++> No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.
Hey <+++++> Wow, Monica 's letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?
Hey! <+++++> Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth  Hornswoggle.
Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe Phd. <+++++> Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.
Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman!  What 's this? <+++++> What?
Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate! <+++++> I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man.   Whoa-oh-whoa! Are you, are you okay?
Shake it! <+++++> Shake it!
Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great. It's certainly the easier choice... <+++++> Right!
Oh, I wouldn 't miss it for the world. <+++++> I 'm-I'm Ross by the way.
All right, let 's get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us. <+++++> Oh, great!
All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it. <+++++> No, you don't.
Are... are you OK? <+++++> Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he?
That's what we decided. <+++++> Uhm, right!
Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War? <+++++> Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Thanks, Ross. <+++++> Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo! <+++++> To be fair, he doesn 't seem to be impersonating Fonzie
We don 't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing. <+++++> I 'm kinda beat.
Have a nice six more months Ross! <+++++> Okay! Okay! Okay. I 'm sorry. Please, please, you were in Western Europe and?
Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y 'know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart. <+++++> I didn 't give her that ring!
I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated. <+++++> What... what you working on?
Yeah, a woman I went to college with just became the first female blacksmith down there. <+++++> Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg.
No-no-no, no. I'm going to talk. I believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun. <+++++> Huh?
Is the window open? Because if there's a window open, a bird could fly in there. <+++++> Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think you're right. I think listen, listen!
Does he, uh, fight with other animals? <+++++> No-no, he's, he's very docile.
I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed <+++++> This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.
I do know. <+++++> It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
Thanks! <+++++> All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
Dangerous Liaisons. <+++++> Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I 'm just glad we didn't do anything stupid. <+++++> Tell me about it.
OH! Oh, oh! <+++++> NO! No, no!
Just one? I drive you all the way down here, and I don't get to see how it works out? <+++++> Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets.
Anyway, it uh look it'll just take me a while to get over her, that's all. I'm not even sure how to do that, I mean I've never been in love before so <+++++> What?! You 're in love with her.
Yes, it's twins! <+++++> Oh my God.
Uh-huh. <+++++> Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.
Oh Ross!! <+++++> What?! What?! Rach what?!
This isn 't how it's supposed to go, there can't be another guy. <+++++> Well
So, I guess you're next. You're ready? <+++++> I don't think so.
Newark airport. Why, where are you? <+++++> JFK.
Really, I shouldn't feel guilty? <+++++> No, God! Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.
Hi! <+++++> Hey, Phoebe.
Oh, wait a minute it 's not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original! <+++++> Uh actually, we-we 've narrowed it down to two names.
Well, I'm very impressed. <+++++> Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.
Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes? <+++++> I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller! <+++++> Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I 'd have to talk you into this more.
Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools? <+++++> Really?!
Ah, well, unless it's the creepy guy with his hand up his kilt, I'm gonna say congratulations! <+++++> Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not that I'm keeping score or anything... five!
Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel. <+++++> Yeah, I guess I should.  Man, y 'know what I have to realize? Maybe I'm just not the type of guy women can have just one night with. Y'know, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that.
Ross, take me off speakerphone. <+++++> Hi.
Its a girl? <+++++> Hey Amy.
It's a... It's good to meet you! Thank you so much for taking the time out to show me around. <+++++> Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.
Are you sure you wanna do this? <+++++> Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla. <+++++> Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?
Well, did-did you correct him? <+++++> No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.
Is-is-is that message old or new?  Old or new?! Old or new?! <+++++> It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?
Are you gonna be okay? <+++++> I am now.
Hey! Hey Adrienne. <+++++> I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.
Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your wedding, but I don 't-can't get up. <+++++> Oh, I 'll-I'll come hug you.
This is totally your fault! <+++++> My fault?! You threatened the judge!
Of course she would, you're a college man. <+++++> I don't know.
Oh, poor baby. <+++++> Tell my son that I love him.  Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!
You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse. <+++++> No.
Monica 's pregnant. <+++++> Oh my God. Oh my God! And you 're-you're you're not freaking out?
No, I just talked to them. <+++++> I'm calling Mom.
Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one who has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received. <+++++> Hey!
All right, all right. Let 's go! <+++++> Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctor 's keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry
Rub it. <+++++> No.
Oh. Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person. Big deal. Besides, it 's kinda fun hiding. <+++++> Yeah.
Hey, you guys! <+++++> Hey!
I can 't. I keep seeing it the good way. <+++++> I 'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay.  Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical.
Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor. <+++++> Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'
Ross gave it to me. <+++++> Yeah, I think she looks good.
Why is Ross naked? <+++++> I-I had to show Chandler something?
Can you believe how lame this is? <+++++> I 'm sorry, I don't believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.
What's in the bag? <+++++> Um, just some presents.
Thank God you 're here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself? <+++++> That 's less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was.
No-no. <+++++> Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
Hey! <+++++> Hey-yeah.  Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please?  Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!
Alright thanks, oh Ross could you stop by the coffee house and get me a muffin? <+++++> Sure what kind?
-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you! <+++++> Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were.
yeah I've nothing to be ashamed of ok so I haven't been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. Ok I haven't had a real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave. which he will and that's ok. so I'll just be alone forever you know alright I'll be. it'll be fine. it'll be fine. I'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians. Oh <+++++> I'll get it
And that horrible museum tour! <+++++> No, I arranged that...
Do you know how fast you were traveling back there? <+++++> Ah no. I don 't, but it could not have been more than sixty.
What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book! <+++++> Your make-up!
Where have you been? <+++++> I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office. There was some guy that freaked everybody out.
So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing is... <+++++> Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?
Just washing the windshield. <+++++> There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don 't you just hand over the keys?
Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with... <+++++> Buddy, my monkey, my monkey.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Here we go! Okay, keep pushing! Wait! I see something. <+++++> What? You do? You do?  Oh my God!
Would you tell her I let you win please? <+++++> Oh. Yeah.  Uh Chandler let me win. No, Chandler 's really strong. Oh my arm is so sore. Oh nurse!
And say what? "You owe me a goodbye", I mean, he's got more pride than that. <+++++> THE HELL I DO!
Hey, hey Ross. <+++++> Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?
Yeah, well, you don't have your racket. <+++++> No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
Oh! Oh, God! <+++++> What is this?!
No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed. <+++++> There you go. Thank you!
I'm sorry...  Ross Geller... Benjamin Hobart. <+++++> It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize,  whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into the field.
You okay?  You all right? <+++++> So we should probably get going soon.
Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"?  No? Divorce? <+++++> Hey.

See? <+++++> That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.
Ish. I just don't think I can bear it. <+++++> Rachel, I know that you can. And you should.
'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.' <+++++> Wait a minute, look.
Yeah, what the hell did I know! <+++++> Look, look, there 's got to be a way we can work past this. Okay,  I can't imagine, I can't imagine my life without you.  Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach,  and, and....
Thanks Ross. <+++++> Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger. I can't tell you how much respect I have for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition.
Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this  I don 't really know what that means.  You were saying? <+++++> And I can even understand that you couldn 't tell Rachel, but why couldn't you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didn't.
Uh-oh. <+++++> What?
That was you! <+++++> Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
The most unbelievable thing happened to me today. <+++++> Hi!
Excuse me Mr. Mexico. <+++++> Eh, either way I 'll pass.  I still can't eat those.  What's so funny?!
Good. <+++++> Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus.
Oh. <+++++> No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to
Argh! <+++++> Argh!
What? I don 't get it. <+++++> Oh man, this is hilarious.
Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head! <+++++> I am gonna see her again.
Just so you know... With us... it's never off the table. <+++++> Damn it. It's never off the table.
Y'know what, that 's fine, maybe you haven't grown up, but I have. <+++++> Oh-ho, okay.
It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable. <+++++> Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that 's why you have got to be the bigger man here. <+++++> Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn 't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me! <+++++> You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
Petty... <+++++> Petty...
Worse? <+++++> Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians...   "Can we walk"?  Oh, you... you like that?
You spent a hundred dollars. That 's the limit. You're screwed! <+++++> Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally, technically I didn 't break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
What? What are you gonna do? <+++++> No more falafel for you!
Dad!! <+++++> Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why don 't we get some shoes on ya, huh? Hey, why don't you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! Yay!!
Oh, I know. <+++++> So-so come! Why don 't you come?
Oh God, absolutely. <+++++> 
I can 't believe you're not going to propose! <+++++> Hey, I 'm not going to rush into anything!
Yeah, they're great seats too! <+++++> Guess where they are?
What? Why?! <+++++> This is weird for me!
That's easy, baggage claim. <+++++> Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
Oh my God! I don 't believe it! Oh, you poor bunny. <+++++> I 'm an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I'd be out and she'd, she'd see some beautiful woman, and, and she'd be Ross y'know look at her, and I'd think, God, my wife is cool!
I 'll take a coffee.  So how was your big date last night? <+++++> Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.
Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this. <+++++> Do you have a point?
What? I 'm not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing. <+++++> Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley.
Oh, that's pretty. <+++++> So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?
Yeah it is, it is.  We really, really have to do something about that. <+++++> I know.
Good different? <+++++> Nobody likes change.
Da Da. <+++++> Huh?
You too. <+++++> Oh, I will.
Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves! <+++++> Bumming hard, guys, bumming hard.
All right Chandler, you 're up. <+++++> Wait a minute, I-I believe I 'm entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse. <+++++> Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
Good. <+++++> Yeah?
Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?! <+++++> Well let's just say  Rosss caaaaan!
Hi! <+++++> Wow! Happy Monica 's night!
Oh! It 's you.  Hi. <+++++> Hey, do uh, do you have a minute?
Ah, a little preview! <+++++> Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high road, because in about five minutes I 'm gonna be saying
Hey, is, is, is Chandler here? <+++++> No, no he 's not.
Rob Tillman! <+++++> No-no. It 's-it's me, Ross!
Actually, we already found a house we love. <+++++> What?
Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name! <+++++> Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese? <+++++> I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
Whoa!  I kinda liked it. <+++++> Okay, I know what I have to do. I 've got to go Red Ross.  Y'know, Red Ross!
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Hey! <+++++> Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela? <+++++> Where in Cuba?
Oh, but the party 's only just getting started! <+++++> Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y 'know, then The Plaza for dinner.
Chandler, look they 're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them. <+++++> Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn 't go with Mark? <+++++> No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don 't know, I feel like lately, I feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it's dumb, but I hate that I'm not a part of it.
When certain people leave the table and I am not finished! <+++++> Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!
It's open. <+++++> Hey!
Okay, I 'm not gonna have one. <+++++> Neither will I.
Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world. <+++++> Lemme see.
Ah, all right. Here's to Ross! <+++++> And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.
Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel 's sister's cabin. <+++++> So, for the whole weekend?
Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining. <+++++> Oh, just hold on a second. I 'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don 't know what the big deal is. I'm man enough to play this sport.
You know what, I think we've had all the bad luck we're going to have. <+++++> My God. Rachel!  Your here. I can't believe it.  What happen? Why are you here?
What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda! <+++++> Barbados.
Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone. <+++++> Nono, she's gone.
I just, I feel, I-I just... <+++++> What?
Okay, let 's talk outside. <+++++> Phoebe, you can 't massage people in my apartment!
Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come! <+++++> Hey!
Ross! <+++++> Hi!
Uh... November? <+++++> I wanna say it's not looking good.
Uh-huh! <+++++> I 've said it! Okay?! But it's over Joey!
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke. <+++++> Your joke? Well, I think  'the Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
A part of him did yes. <+++++> Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth.  So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
Oh hi! <+++++> Hi!
Thing? <+++++> Thing, yes. Thing.
Uh Ross? You asked me that. <+++++> Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I 'm not a mind reader! Besides, I hate those conversations. I'm horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a gesture. Y'know, something that says we're moving forward without having to talk about it.
Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross! <+++++> Yeah, yeah, oh!
Uh... yeah, why? <+++++> Uh, nothing, I'm sure they'll be impressed with your excellent compuper skills.
Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four? <+++++> Yeah.
Definitely <+++++> This is Vicrum.
Okay! All your tests look fine. Now, are you two interested in knowing the sex of the baby? <+++++> Uh, no. No, we're not.
Okay, great! <+++++> All right.
Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. <+++++> No! For all I know, she 's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place.  Right here.
We've gotta go, we've got that cab waiting. <+++++> Alright, alright, ok. Bye.
Hi! <+++++> Hi.
Oh, I don't know. <+++++> Joey, it's worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.
Hey. <+++++> Hey, Pheebs.
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some? <+++++> No thanks. I 'm 29.
Okay... <+++++> Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?
Oohh, I love it! <+++++> Really? You're not gonna return it?
Yes! <+++++> Yes! We 're getting married?!
Okay, I do. <+++++> Okay.
Oh it... good! Yeah, but I'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days. <+++++> Oh, you know what? You're gonna get it. I-I-I-I can feel it.
Oh that 'd be great. Sure! <+++++> "There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct "
Take thee, Emily... <+++++> Take thee, Rachel... Emily.  Emily.
Alan. <+++++> He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
Yeah, we 're gonna go. <+++++> I 'm sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y'know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a little.
I tried, but apparantly singing  "I will survive" in a helium voice \- not helping. <+++++> Hey you guys!
Ooh... Not so good. <+++++> Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?
Why is everything different? <+++++> Bye!
No matter how much we want it. <+++++> Even if we want it really bad.
No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking. <+++++> Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.
Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George. <+++++> Wow! How'd you get in there?
I got to figure out what I 'm going to wear. <+++++> High collar and baggy pants say I 'm a pro.
Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria 's Secret catalogues, not a gym! <+++++> Come on, you know they love you.
Before or after you were shot by your own troops? <+++++> I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it. <+++++> This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.
Of course we're hitting faces, why wouldn't you hit faces? <+++++> Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.
Yeah, you don 't want that. <+++++> No!
Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller. <+++++> That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want.  Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee! Now!
Oh we-we didn 't. <+++++> No-no. We
Wow, those pills really worked, huh? <+++++> Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister , I love Pheebs...
Hey. <+++++> Aww, is it broken?
Yeah. That 's Daddy. <+++++> That 's Daddy?! But doesn't it bother you? You're a waitress.
No, she's at a faculty meeting. <+++++> Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but... Susan
You jerk! You know how much I love that kid! <+++++> Monica bang! Monica bang!  Ow!
What? <+++++> I 'm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.
Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side! <+++++> Where there is no fear of commitment.
Ok... <+++++> This feels perfectly normal. Ok, get on the swing!
What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch? <+++++> What?!
Yeah. <+++++> I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?
I mean think about all the money that you 're gonna make! <+++++> Why? What?
Not even one more time? <+++++> Not even once.
Sure, I'll go check on Emma. <+++++> Thanx.
I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky. <+++++> Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunky s.
Thanks. <+++++> Okay, Pheebs
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too. <+++++> My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this.
He's under sedation, so he's pretty much out. <+++++> I'm feeling better.
What're you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel? <+++++> That was 14 hours ago.
What? <+++++> Monica, I 'm cutting you off.
No, that would be,  "Why are you being cute?" <+++++> Okay, I'm working on my flirting.
Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me up. <+++++> Glad I could help man.
No, no, no. <+++++> OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.
I just- I don 't think us getting back together is a good idea. <+++++> Eh?
Learn about Jesus... <+++++> Hey!
All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing incident... when I was little. <+++++> Seriously?
You think you 're gonna get out of this on a technicality? <+++++> Look, I 'm not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!
What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon! <+++++> I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
She was a drug dealer! <+++++> Well, anyway, it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him, because  I was about to do some serious damage!
Why not? <+++++> Because it 's weird!
Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?! <+++++> Yeah!
No no no, behind it. <+++++> Wha-, you have a phone in here?
Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play! <+++++> People can hear you.

Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, it 's really hot. <+++++> Really?
Bye. <+++++> Chloe, Chloe how 's it coming?!!
He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is. <+++++> The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
So...Thank you. <+++++> Could you be less enthused?
Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth. <+++++> Hey.
Hey, I've been honing! <+++++> What was with the dishes?
Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot? <+++++> Oh yeah!

I'm crazy about her. <+++++> And she feels the same way?
Says who? Your mom? <+++++> Yeah.
Ok, who ordered what? <+++++> Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.
Come on! I don 't want you thinking of me like that any more! <+++++> Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It 's one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend.  Oop, oh yeah!

To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you 're not gonna be on TV! <+++++> No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.
Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but... <+++++> Monica told me you had a blind date.

I don't have travel insurance. <+++++> Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!
Right. <+++++> I mean we don 't want to go down that road do we?
Look man! <+++++> People need juice!
Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie? <+++++> Then you should have said something before I met her.
What are you guys doing? <+++++> Nothing.
Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to <+++++> You'll see. Okay.  Oh, what's-what's her name?
Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs! <+++++> I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?
So I'm thinking about you. So what? <+++++> I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
Oh, y'know what, I didn 't want cinnamon on this. <+++++> Sorry.
Okay, what do you guys think? <+++++> Dude!
You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually do win? <+++++> Uh, you're not gonna win.
Okay. <+++++> Okay.
You must be so happy! <+++++> Yes, yes I am, one of the many things I 'm feeling. Well....
Hi. <+++++> This is Rachel.
Poco... a leetle. <+++++> Do you know the word crapweasel?
I know what your problem is. <+++++> Oh you do, do you?
Well thank you, you too. <+++++> Thanks.
Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now. <+++++> Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?
Good bye Ross. <+++++> Uh, oh-ho bye.
Okay. <+++++> Yeah I 'll press 1!
Let's show 'em. <+++++> Okay dad.
We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part. <+++++> What?!
It didn 't click. <+++++> I heard it. I heard it.
Ross? <+++++> Yeah?
Whatever. <+++++> It 's like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y 'know that if I'd work with stocks, I'd have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox. <+++++> Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we 'd still hang out?
Nothing. <+++++> Come on, tell me.
Professor Geller? <+++++> Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?
For every night that you 're asleep before I get home from work... <+++++> Yeah.
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in! <+++++> What, now?
Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm. <+++++> Woooo! Yeah!
"I'm a little bit country"... <+++++> "...and I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll"!
It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn 't, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go! <+++++> Okay! Okay! But if she doesn 't call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y'know just to she what's going on, and, and she says she'll call me back, but then she doesn't. Then it 's over.
Hey! Which one 's my turkey burger? <+++++> Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
It really was. You've learned some new moves! <+++++> Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me "Sex for Dummies" as a joke.
that's why she was weird. <+++++> yes, yeah I said something stupid about her never having had a serious relationship, but you should know she is so much fun, a wonderful person please don't blow her off.
Bye! <+++++> Later!
I think I accidentally used Monica 's boxes to keep the water away from the Porsche. <+++++> Oh no. Dad! Dad! What  Oh God everything's ruined! Dad, she's gonna be crushed!
It 's picture time. <+++++> Now you are going to love these.
All right, me too.  Should we wake her up? <+++++> No! No, come on let her sleep! She 's so exhausted.
Yeah, what was wrong with your old human teeth. <+++++> Ahh, I-I did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to.
What do you see? What do you see? <+++++> We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.
I know. You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today? <+++++> Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.
What, you guys really think that I 'm that shallow? <+++++> No, I just think Monica was that fat.
Steps!  Slut!  You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy! <+++++> What?!
I had too okay?! We 're getting married! Married couples can't keep secrets from one another! <+++++> Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
Wow, really? <+++++> Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me...
Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass. <+++++> I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?
All right, we 'll call you when we get back. <+++++> Okay.
Oh, y 'know what? It's probably just your burnin' loins. <+++++> Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry. <+++++> Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.
Umm, this is great wine. <+++++> It 's from France In Europe Western Europe. Y'know umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe.
Because I 'm normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present. <+++++> Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
Sorry. Sorry. <+++++> Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.
Please, one ridiculous problem at a time! <+++++> It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!
Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark? <+++++> Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff?  Well-
Dr. Geller, there 's a seat over here. <+++++> Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I 'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.
Oh, I gotta go back in there. <+++++> What? Why? What 's wrong?
Why? <+++++> I think she's lonely.
Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah... <+++++> A wandering?
Ugh! I don 't know what I'm going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don't care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is? <+++++> Hey guys!
No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged! <+++++> What?
What? <+++++> Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and he grabs the table and he pulls himself up. He pulled himself up. Standing man. I'm sorry you guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it.
Oh, he 's fine. He's fine. It's just that us getting along is difficult for him, because he doesn't like me. <+++++> Oh come on! That 's-that's true.
The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag. <+++++> Okay, you are totally making this up.
Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle? <+++++> Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.
Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!! <+++++> What's going on?
Can we do it again? <+++++> No-no.
Okay, excuse me for a minute. <+++++> Wh -Hey-Whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!
Actually, I'm a... kind of a.... you know, a... date-type... thing... of Rachel's. <+++++> A date.
No. <+++++> Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?
Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner. <+++++> Thanks for being born.
Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me. <+++++> I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.
You think it looked amazing? <+++++> I uh I don 't know. I mean I I honestly didn't watch it.
Hey! <+++++> Hi!
No, no no no, don't need to know the details. <+++++> It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird.
I 'll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired. <+++++> Ohh! A man with a plan!
This is so great. <+++++> You wanna explain that?
See? They're as different as night and... later that night. <+++++> Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage. It was nice, nice... uh... meeting you.
OK, OK. <+++++> Cat.
One swift kick and he 'll back off. <+++++> All right, bad ankle, got it!
Sandwiches! <+++++> Correct. Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl 's breast?
A lesbian? <+++++> Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?
No, he really said it. <+++++> ... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...
You too. Last night was just wonderful. <+++++> It really was.
Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but... Susan <+++++> Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
What?!  What the hell?! <+++++> All right, y 'know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I'm sorry, I'm just gonna have to take it back.
He said he's really gonna miss you guys. <+++++> You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.
By someone besides Monica? <+++++> No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.
Uh huh! If it's a girl, Phoebe, and if it's a boy, Phoebo! <+++++> Maybe. But it wouldn't hurt to have a backup, you know? Uh, Rach-Rach, what were you thinking?
Well, that 's not something a girl wants to hear. <+++++> No, come on don 't start.  Ouch!
Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook. <+++++> Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
No Ross!!  Don 't! You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn't work that way. It doesn't just make it better. Okay? <+++++> Okay, okay, okay.
Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night.  Where exactly were around ten-ish? <+++++> Well, I 'm gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like?
Breathe. <+++++> Breathe.
What, like a number? <+++++> Hey!
I got it! <+++++> Okay.
We're having a girl. <+++++> Oh, wow! Yay! Wow! Hooray! Oh, man!
I can't think of anything. <+++++> Thanks!
Yeah, complicated  'cause of the love. <+++++> I I do, I do not love Rachel. I 'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
Yes! Ross, you have to stay! <+++++> All right.
Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach. <+++++> Okay, I'll have the fixed salad and the duck.
Oh, thanks. So, uh, what are you gonna do this summer? <+++++> Oh, you know, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna hang out, work on my music.
Hi! <+++++> Hey uh, this is Elizabeth.
Oh yeah! With who? <+++++> You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town!  Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!!  I mean, way to go Ben!  Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition. <+++++> I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings
Thank you, Ross. <+++++> Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love.
Well actually <+++++> No-no-no! It 's mine! It's-it's mine.
Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson.  Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?! <+++++> Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
It's my baby too. <+++++> Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.
It doesn't say that. Does it? <+++++> How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
Yeah, little Eric. <+++++> That 's right! Wait no, Ben.
Isn't there any way you can keep him? <+++++> No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
Why not? <+++++> The carbon, it 's messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.
Hey you guys I 'm gonna take off. I just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye. <+++++> Rachel said she 'd marry you?!
Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I 'm also really psyched 'cause I don't have to move in here! <+++++> Oh no, yeah no, that part 's great!
No..! <+++++> Show them to me!
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief. <+++++> You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.
God? <+++++> It was you, pal.
Hey. <+++++> So it 's looks like we're the first ones here.
It 's okay. Sometimes, things don't work out the way you'd thought they would. <+++++> Come here.
It 's not that far! Just drop! <+++++> Do not rush me!!
I don't know. What are you wearing? <+++++> Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?
Ohh, wait a minute, we haven 't pre <+++++> Go!
Ah, so what are we looking at? <+++++> Well uh, you see that, that little cluster of stars next to the big one? That is Ursa Major.
You got it.  You got Nevada twice. <+++++> I know.
What 's too much fun? <+++++> Y 'know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.
Oh that's so cute <+++++> I don't know. But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know. He plays piano; I played keyboards in college. He's been divorced; I have some experience in that area.
Man, I am so beat. <+++++> Oh yeah.
You 're so sweet! And I'm so surprised! <+++++> You really didn 't know?
Hey, my favorite part is coming up! <+++++> 'Kay!
Hey! <+++++> I just asked that girl out.
Make it stop!! <+++++> No!!
Rehearse it! <+++++> Hi!
Right! <+++++> Right?
Is Joey Tribbiani here? <+++++> Umm, no.
Ross.. <+++++> It's all working out! Me & Charlie, and you two. You know what we should do?
So, what do you think? <+++++> I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didn 't I didn't propose! <+++++> Then what did happen?
Well, what is the truth? <+++++> Yeah, what's going on?
Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her? <+++++> 
Shut up, Joey! <+++++> So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone. <+++++> What happened you guys?
Hello. <+++++> Hi! It 's me.
No, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, if anything, I think this could help you. You know what? Why don't we all go out to dinner together, and I can introduce you. <+++++> Well, if you think it would help.
Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh... <+++++> Is everything ok?
Uh huh. <+++++> Hey hey, can I help?
Hey. <+++++> Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.
Thanks. <+++++> Where is she?
Oh. <+++++> No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him.
Looks good, uh? <+++++> Yeah.
That's great! <+++++> Congratulations!
Yeah, like a chimney. <+++++> Ohh, big smoker.
Ross... <+++++> Oh no, maybe it's me , I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good...  IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris.
C'MON! <+++++> Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm standin here, huh.
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head? <+++++> No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman 's tux!
Mommy, what's wrong with that man? <+++++> Hey, I helped you find Waldo!
Ouh <+++++> Oh my god. Phoebe, you used to mug people?
Hey. <+++++> Hey.
I 'm telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together! <+++++> That 's not true! Her, she doesn't even know what she wants! Rachel's still mad about the whole thing.
How come you didn't come over earlier? <+++++> 'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man.
I can't. I can't do it, I can't marry Mindy. I think I'm still in love with you. <+++++> Oh!
Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed. <+++++> Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.
Hey! <+++++> Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.
Bye! Thank God <+++++> Dude, what'd you have?
Yeah, we are. <+++++> No, we 're not.
I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical. <+++++> Where the hell have you been?
Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy. <+++++> Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy!  Huh, am I having a boy?
Now that you 're on you're own, you're free to look as stupid as you like. <+++++> You like it right?
Oh. Oh! I can do it! <+++++> Yeah!
It does. It really and truly does. <+++++> It so does not!!!
Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!! <+++++> Okay!!
But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do... Ah, it's not true, there is... nothing I want to do. <+++++> I see... Thanks very much.  Is this your son?
Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat -I don't want to talk about it. <+++++> Hey!
You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish? <+++++> All I 'm saying is, it's one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don't know, like a  surprise!!
It's called the cherry. <+++++> It's the -Chandler!!
Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw! <+++++> Yeah!
Hi. <+++++> How 'd did it go?
Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it. <+++++> That would be no.
Breathe. <+++++> Breathe.
All right, we should call somebody. <+++++> And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn 't moving.
All right, he's crowning. Here he comes. <+++++> Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?
No, it's been three nights in a row. <+++++> Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.
Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon.  I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade? <+++++> Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff. <+++++> That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.
Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year. <+++++> What?
Yeah that 's true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer. <+++++> Look, we 've been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby.  It's just if-if we got together again and it didn't work out I could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking everything- Oh that's now me. What do they put something in the water in this place? Since Rachel and I we're doing really, we're doing really well right now.
Hi. <+++++> Oh God.
Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents. <+++++> That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! I 'm gonna kill you!! <+++++> Y 'know this is actually not a great time for me.
Hey! <+++++> Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
Hmmm... this is so nice. <+++++> OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
Wait! We need shoes! <+++++> Okay. Um, how about these?
Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit. <+++++> Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot!  Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!
Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper? <+++++> Yeah.
All right Ross!! I get it!! <+++++> I mean my God...
What?! What else did he say? <+++++> Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So  Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.
Yes I'm gonna put it back  exactly where I found it. <+++++> 'Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.
What?! <+++++> What?
Five years. <+++++> You 've sentenced him?!
Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play. <+++++> Really? Wh-what's wrong?
Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed. <+++++> I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this together!
I'm just serving it. <+++++> Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.
Nothing! <+++++> Damn, this coffee 's cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins?
 <+++++> Fifteen.
I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance. <+++++> But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!
Oh God. Ross, OK, if you care about me at all, you will get the pie out of the man's hood. <+++++> Get the what?
Yeah! <+++++> Yeah!!
Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment? <+++++> Oh, yeah, no problems. It 's all taken care of.
Crazy, or... romantic? <+++++> Crazy!
Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this! <+++++> Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.
How can you do this too me?! I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear! <+++++> Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?
Oh Ross, you're so great! <+++++> Ohhhh
We could not, would not want to wait. <+++++> Look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is gonna be there, everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.
No please, show me how I begged you! <+++++> I can show you, I have it on videotape!  It 's an expression.
Oh my God. <+++++> Okay, it 's not, it's not.
Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal. <+++++> It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.
Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister. <+++++> Well, who's gonna kiss my sister.
What?! <+++++> Now I 'm so happy.
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them. <+++++> Really.
I mean, look-look today you escaped   death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily? <+++++> That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.
My hamster. I hope she's okay, I haven't seen her in a while. Have a seat. <+++++> Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh  ...do you have any , um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?
You know what I really really want? <+++++> What, Rach?
No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him! <+++++> Alright, let's go!
That must have been hard. <+++++> It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says...  "What are you doing with those things? What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like a... like a real boy?
I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out. <+++++> Dude, I was gonna ask her out.
That 's not gonna work out! Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, "Oh that's okay. You'll find someone." And then, bamn! She finds you! <+++++> Yeah, well, m-maybe you 're right.
Oh, you 're switching apartments? <+++++> It 's not for me, it's for Rachel.
ÃÂÃÂ¡Ewww! <+++++> ÃÂÃÂ¡Hola, Joey!
Your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. That's all I know. <+++++> This is unbelievable.
You two will have very hairy children. <+++++> Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin. <+++++> Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?
No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you. <+++++> Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?
Colorado. <+++++> Ah, what good are you.
Look, the point is, there 's a lot of women out there you haven't even had sex with yet! <+++++> Yeah, he-he 's right, he's right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you're young, you're-you're weird, chicks dig that.
I did that too! They wouldn 't give me her real name or her number. They said, "If I bothered them again they'd call the police." I said, "If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring!" <+++++> So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there 's nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!
I want to go on a ride along! <+++++> Me too!
You got Rachel pregnant?! <+++++> Who did?!
Yeah. <+++++> A bit of a daredevil are we?
Unbelievable! <+++++> We love marriage!
Hey Ross. It 's Joey. There's a hooker over here and we thought maybe you'd know something about it. <+++++> No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I -I need to, I need to lie down.
Ohh <+++++> What 's the matter? You okay?
Oh, hello Ross! <+++++> Susan...
Wow. So, what did you guys do? <+++++> Oh, you know . . . we just drank some beer and Mike played with the boundaries of normal social conduct.
It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT- <+++++> Easy.
I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me. <+++++> For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
When was the last time you saw her wear it? <+++++> Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh
All finished! <+++++> This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.
Yeah, why not.  So I told her. <+++++> Yeah? How'd it go?
She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she? <+++++> She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
Yes, it was. <+++++> No, it wasn't. You don't think I would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old
He 's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness! <+++++> No, I-I-I 'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up!
Yeah. <+++++> They put that in.
Thank you! I had just gone to the beach that weekend. <+++++> Ah .
Yeah... Now I have something... <+++++> I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?
You 're right. <+++++> Joey! No!
Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream. <+++++> Ah, the lesser-known  "I don't have a dream" speech.
Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet. <+++++> Oh yeah? Yeah? I wonder why? What could that smarmy letch possibly want?
Hi! <+++++> Hey!
You do? Why? <+++++> Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
Could you please get her attention? <+++++> W-oa Mommy!
My cousin's a paleontologist. <+++++> Ah?  Well, he and I would probably have a lot to talk about.
Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow!  Love to love ya, baby!  Darnit!  Ugh. <+++++> Hey.
Mon? <+++++> Mon?
Ok, maybe you're right. <+++++> Good night.
You're jealous because I'm a real doctor. <+++++> Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.
Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like,  "Awww, he's got a Ross." <+++++> Yeah, that'd be cool!
No, it's not that. I got fired today. And I didn't get the other job. <+++++> Rach, I'm so sorry.
That's some gentle comedy, dude. <+++++> We're still going at the game, right?
All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won 't recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I.  You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I'll be uh, Mr. Wong. <+++++> Diverse.
Hmm-hmm. <+++++> You sure you're alright?
Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own? <+++++> You are totally jealous.
So what do you, what do you do now? <+++++> So how long are you in town?
I've been here the whole time! <+++++> Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.
Then why didn 't you tell me to do that?!! <+++++> Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.
What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well? What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot. <+++++> You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like!
Look no, I-I know it 's bad, and I know it's wrong. Okay? But-but it's not like anything's ever gonna happen. Y'know? These-these are just feelings, they're gonna go away. <+++++> Y 'know what? I-I gotta go.
ÃÂÃÂ¡Mira, mira, el viejo desnudo estÃÂÃÂ¡ haciendo el hula hoop! <+++++> ÃÂÃÂ¡Ewww!
It's my New Year's resolution! <+++++> What, to blind my child?
It 's my joke. <+++++> It 's my joke.
Because you 're the only one that can be fair. <+++++> Yeah.
I'm pregnant. <+++++> Pregnant?!
Thanks! <+++++> Yes, very nice Rachel.
Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech? <+++++> Yep, we got it, we got it.  Thank you so much.
Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message. <+++++> Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye!
I just feel awful. <+++++> Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!
Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash. <+++++> What?
Come on! You 're just titling!  Her legs are fine! <+++++> I know that!
Do you really see this as a long-term thing? <+++++> I don 't know.
Hi. <+++++> Hi.
Goodnight. <+++++> Goodnight.
Hey that 's okay. So, where do you want to go? <+++++> Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go.
Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom and dad this year? <+++++> Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20 th?
Okay, but Ross just listen to me <+++++> No, no, no, no! Don't tell me! I don't want to know!
Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let 's talk about it!! How was she? <+++++> She was...
Nude... ... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry. <+++++> What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler!
No! <+++++> Oh no!
Oh really? <+++++> No.
Oh well, they 're killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body. <+++++> What? A brain transplant?!
Yeah! <+++++> What 's her last name?
That sounds great! I 'd love to live at Warren's!! I love Warren! Thank you! <+++++> Don 't thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization.  Here's Warren's number.
Tongue? <+++++> Yeah.
No! No, she said you actually proposed to her. <+++++> Well I didn 't! I didn't propose!  Unless uh  Did I? I haven't slept in forty hours and it does sound like something I would do.
Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you? <+++++> Well did you try calling her?
No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving? <+++++> I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.
I'm not! We're having a girl! Sometimes I can't believe it's with you-But still! We're having a girl! <+++++> I know! I know. You know what? I'm putting Ruth back on the table!
Oh now -Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something? <+++++> Uh yeah sure.
No, no, no. <+++++> OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.
Hey. <+++++> You all right?
Oh God, you saw me?! Oh! <+++++> You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
Uh-oh. <+++++> Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
Oh, that 's okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager. <+++++> Yeah.
Ross, that's my jacket. <+++++> I know.
I mean, was it Gina? <+++++> Which one is Gina?
Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while. <+++++> What? What? What?! You guys knew?  You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!
Yes. I like Rachel. <+++++> Rachel?!
Yeah! All right! You go first. <+++++> Okay, okay, I'll go first.
I will wake you up in a way that 's proved very popular in the past. <+++++> Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.
Emma. <+++++> When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a guy you know, for what? A week?
Five. <+++++> Five.
It's really gone? <+++++> Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
All right, look, here 's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice. <+++++> Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn 't work.
It 's All Relative!! <+++++> You don 't have to shout everything.
No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on. <+++++> No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes.
Hello! <+++++> Hello!
Oh God! I gotta go! <+++++> Come on! All the cool kids are eating  'em!
Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years. <+++++> Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie? <+++++> What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn 't expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now, but she's really terrific.
Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance! <+++++> That is correct.
I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don 't want him complimenting my thing. <+++++> I 'm so we weren't in the car! Did he ever let up?
Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin? <+++++> Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?
Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you 're having sex with him. <+++++> Okay, I
Face to face, yeah! <+++++> Okay, here I go.
So umm, does it? <+++++> I 'm sorry.
Do you want us to leave the room, or? <+++++> Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.
Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got!  This is my "Please, hire me" sweater.  And these are my, "Don't you want to rent me this apartment?" pants. <+++++> I don 't think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
But you got to be with both of them, right? <+++++> Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you? <+++++> You take care Jill.
Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?! <+++++> Uh, Rachel, I 've been thinking. I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I'm calling it off.
Marcel, I'm hungry. <+++++> That was good.
Oh uh I actually came here to ask you out. <+++++> Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. I 'm just gonna put this  back in my pocket, pretend that didn 't happen. Uh yeah, actually I'm free now. Do you wanna grab some coffee or
Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel. <+++++> All right. Y'know what? We don 't have to go downstairs! We can bring Vegas up to us!  All right, come on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go.  13.
No we weren 't! <+++++> I was not!
After you. <+++++> Oh no-no, after you.   Oh my God!
Oh, I know it. You 're right. That's not sexy. Oh Oh!  Whoops! Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bed over and get it.  Oh God! <+++++> Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen.
Well, I 'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word. <+++++> So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe 's mom remind anyone of a cat?
No you stop! <+++++> No, you stop!
Oh thank god, if Phoebe's going, can we please take Emma home? <+++++> You know, I think that's a good idea-our babysitter just pounded in another Chardonnet.  Bye, y'guys.
I know! <+++++> And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?
Yes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane! <+++++> Well, what was it?
Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat! <+++++> How much did you pay for that?
Hugh! Hugh Grant! <+++++> Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
Shut the book! <+++++> Let 's also get a hot plate!
See what you did. <+++++> Yeah, listen...
Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while. <+++++> Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?
That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy. <+++++> No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella.
Hey, you keep pushing me on this, my foots going to meet the middle of your ass. <+++++> Dad!!
Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast. <+++++> Yes!
Exactly. <+++++> You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
Right, and the humiliating. <+++++> Oh, well of course, the humiliating. So, so wee, we're okay.
No. <+++++> What?
We don't, we don't wrestle now. <+++++> Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.
This almost never happens! <+++++> Now she's passed.
You want a piece of me, sir? Is that what your saying?  You want a piece of me? <+++++> Okay! Okay! That's it!! Parents!! Parents!! Back away!! All right, this is our wedding day!
Oh great! <+++++> Yeah.
Okay, uh sit down.  Um there's this woman that I like. A lot. But, uh it can't happen. <+++++> She's not a Tribbiani?
I wanna hear  "The Sound." <+++++> Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven 't played in so long, and-and, well it's-it's really personal stuff, y'know?
So what are you guys going to do? <+++++> Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. <+++++> Then don't do that, alright?
Hey, Ross, want some cider? <+++++> No.  So, um, let's see your pretty close, huh. Make-up's on, hair's done.
Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you 're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip. <+++++> Hey, you 're right.
Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross? <+++++> The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!
You 're welcome.  I'm sorry. Did I hurt you? <+++++> It 's worth the pain.  Y'know what, you know what? It's not.
I can't believe you did that. <+++++> Yeah, well.
Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor. <+++++> Uh.
I 'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel... <+++++> Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel , yeah! About jellyfish and how if you...  Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
You're gonna what? <+++++> I'm gonna tell Mom.
Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and... <+++++> Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?
Excuse me... This hospital is for people! <+++++> Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour? <+++++> Are you serious?!
Didn 't you two already talk? <+++++> Yeah but uh Okay, okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slept together, but there 's something else.  Rachel's pregnant.
Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep. <+++++> Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day? <+++++> Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
So, uhm... what are you gonna do today? <+++++> Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!
Yes! There's still pie. <+++++> I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand! <+++++> Hey!
No, not really. You 're pressing the baby into my bladder and now I have to pee. Sorry. <+++++> Uh Rach?
Okay. <+++++> Okay.  You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad! <+++++> Yeah!
How could you mess this up? It's so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!! <+++++> How do you count to five?
Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary? <+++++> I know. That's why I did it.  Come on, are they really that bad?
No no no. Talk... dirty. <+++++> Wha... what, here?
Okay, bye! <+++++> What the hell was that?!
Don't you have a laundry room in your building? <+++++> Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
Hey! I brought you some house warming gifts. <+++++> Aww.
But... <+++++> No. You're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now, OK, you're not... rommmates anymore.
Hi sweetie! <+++++> Hey, how are you holding up?
I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I... <+++++> Honey, I love you too.
I 'm an alien. I'm an alien. <+++++> Oh no! An asteroid!
Ben, its Rachel!  But whatever. <+++++> Everything okay in there?
Thanks.  Great so we can all go together! I gotta run. Catch you later! <+++++> Bye!
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks. <+++++> Pass it! Pass it!
Why? <+++++> Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.
Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then M-B-O... <+++++> Damnit!
I didn 't know Playboy prints jokes. <+++++> Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It 's not just about the pictures.
Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in my life. <+++++> Too little, too late, Benji!
Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. Why don 't you tell me what happened. <+++++> Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk
Hi! <+++++> Hey!
Oh, I 'll-I'll be fine. Just God I hate her Ross! I hate her! <+++++> Will, high school was-was a long time ago.
I don 't think you understand packing. Look, I just don't want to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here. <+++++> Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on.
Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday? <+++++> What? I... I...
Oh please, you inhale your food! <+++++> I grew up with Monica! If you didn 't eat fast you didn't eat!!
Pretty good! I told her. <+++++> Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh?  But.. we don't have to go down that road.
Ross, why didn 't you tell me that? <+++++> Eh,  'cause I knew that if I told you, you'd make me go, and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on.
Or not. Uh, Rach, why don 't you just move in with me? <+++++> Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
Oh no, what happened? <+++++> Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox.
Ross play rugby? I don 't think so. <+++++> What 's ah, what's so funny about that?
Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I know we 're not supposed to see each other anymore and I'm okay with that, it's just that I don't know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to about it. <+++++> Of course, what happened?
Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column. <+++++> Can't we just use a pen?
It 's okay! It's okay! It kicked once, it'll kick again! <+++++> Oh my God!
Hey, hey, and I'm in the movie. <+++++> What happened?
There she is! <+++++> Rachel! Rachel!
Yes, I did! And you are welcome! <+++++> Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
All right, you two, stop it! <+++++> No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.
Hey!  What happened to you? Why didn 't you come up? <+++++> Done!
After the snap! <+++++> Before the snap!
Yeah, you still have feelings for me. And-and to be honest, I-I still have feelings for you. And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we can 't. It's too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just It just wasn't meant to be. <+++++> Oh God you 're right.
How about those three pointers? <+++++> Amazing!
Ohh, of course Monica 's brother! <+++++> Yeah. Right.
Okay <+++++> But that 's not enough. So So here's a key to my apartment.
Oh, hi! <+++++> Hi!
Thank you. <+++++> Of course.
Oh no, I can 't go. I'm practicing; I got an audition to be the host of a new game show. <+++++> Oh cool!
Ross, what's the matter? <+++++> Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
Honey, I was wondering.... <+++++> Hmm?
Yeah right! <+++++> What?
You know when "That's fine" sounds true when someone yells it and spits! <+++++> No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You know
I did! <+++++> I know! I 'm saying you have to watch them all the time.
Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn 't Rachel. <+++++> No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?
Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away! <+++++> Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you!  All right Rach, let's go!
Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing. <+++++> Dude! You're not taking your Bible?
Oh yeah it is! I 'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes. <+++++> Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
 <+++++> Damnit!
Oh, you know what? <+++++> What?
It 's not that kind of anniversary. <+++++> Ah!  Oh.
I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here. <+++++> Come on sweetie! You 've had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them. <+++++> Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
Dude, I screwed up, you don 't have to turn me in! <+++++> Not on you! On the stripper!
Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark? <+++++> Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
The man is showing brain. <+++++> Are you sure?  Hold on.  I 'm sorry you guys, that was a coffee and a....
Oh!! My God, what are you doing here? <+++++> Well you said you couldn 't go out so....
But what if uh -and I'm not saying she will be-But <+++++> If she is where you are then uh then my feeling weird about it shouldn't stand in the way.
Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution? <+++++> Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?
Ross, are you okay? <+++++> I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
Chandler told me. <+++++> Chandler. When did he... when did he... when did he?
No! <+++++> Now umm, remember I 'm still learning.
What? <+++++> Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em.
Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that. <+++++> Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.
Well, I haven 't discussed it with him yet, but I know he's gonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book. <+++++> That 's not really porn.
Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I would like them to bond. <+++++> Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.
Yeah. <+++++> Nice shades.
You, you, you said he liked me.  You, you slowpokes! <+++++> That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler.
I actually needed to talk to you before the birth. <+++++> Okay, what 's up?
Yes, the hard part is truly over. <+++++> No, but come on, we 're off to a great start aren't we? I knew I'd get you here fast, but this has got to be some kind of a record!
You 're kidding! And he plays rugby?! That's so funny.  Ohh! I see how you did that. All right. <+++++> Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I 'm gonna show her how tough I really am!
Oh Ross! <+++++> Hi!
I don't sound like that. <+++++> Oh, oh Chandler...
I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you. <+++++> Stop it.
Well that 's his last name. <+++++> And his first name.
Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy? <+++++> Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!
It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken.  Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson. <+++++> Oh, thank God!
Oh, you know, wait. I do have one question.  Do you guys do random drug testing? <+++++> Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.
dammit! <+++++> So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since I've been away at college.
Ross! Stop that! <+++++> Ah, I 'm sorry.
Hey, who's this little naked guy? <+++++> That little naked guy would be me.
Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you? <+++++> Yeah, of course, Donald.
You 're gonna be a great father. <+++++> Well you 're gonna be a wonderful grandma.
Oh, this terrible! Eve rything is destroyed! Look at this.  It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don't even know what it is! Ohh, it's still soft.  What do you think this is? <+++++> All right. I think it was a mouse.
Hey! Ross! <+++++> Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
Oh, my God! She has food delivered here? <+++++> Mm-hmm. She's-she's emotional, but, but ballsy.
Oh, I can't believe you called her fat. <+++++> I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
Oh, everything's pink. <+++++> Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
How are ya man? <+++++> Oh hey, that was a good one, huh?  Help! Help!
The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily. <+++++> That is what the thing is.
It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner. <+++++> Yeah, okay. Alright.
I know! <+++++> Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?
Well, then...Let's. <+++++> I, I just never think of money as an issue.
Well, this has been great! <+++++> See ya!
I'll get it.  Hello? Ross's place. Mike speaking.  It's for you. <+++++> I don't understand what just happened here.
I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job! And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee -ahh!! Ross, we need to talk. <+++++> Okay. Sometimes I feel
I believe it. <+++++> No you don 't.
Hi! So I 'm out having lunch at Monica's and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale 's and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he's gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview! <+++++> Wow!
Are ya getting married? <+++++> Nope.
That you 're not funny or sexy? <+++++> That 's right!
Who is also in charge of purchasing. <+++++> Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--
Cool, thanks. <+++++> You okay?
I know. It's just such reckless spending. <+++++> I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon. <+++++> Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?
Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong? <+++++> How might you be wrong?
Hi guys! <+++++> Hey!
Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video. <+++++> No.
You wanted to see me Professor Geller? <+++++> Yes. Yes! Please, come in.
What? <+++++> Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she like freaks out. Watch! Watch!
God, what is wrong with me. <+++++> You need to get some sleep.
I gotta get one, too. <+++++> What are you guys doing?
You, you want me to help you with that? <+++++> Why, does it look like I 'm having trouble with my misshapen claw?
You're kidding, no! <+++++> Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So
Yeah. We'd go to the science lab after hours! <+++++> AND ON MY TURF?
Yeah, it takes two incomes. <+++++> Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.
Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming... <+++++> Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?
And uh, Liam, Liam 's got bad knees. You hit him right and he'll go down like a lamp. <+++++> But-but, Liam 's on my team.
Hey. <+++++> Hey! How long until Pete 's fight?
You won't even taste it? <+++++> No!
Because a car backfired? <+++++> Okay, why are you here?
Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice. <+++++> What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
Seriously, where did this happen? <+++++> Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.
Dude, none of this is cool. <+++++> No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example
No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses. <+++++> Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it.  Or you just do it.
I used to love to play restaurant. <+++++> Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
What? <+++++> Ah, Cheryl!
Okay, you got it. <+++++> Yes! yes!
I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out. <+++++> Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.
Ohhh! <+++++> Uh-hmm.
So you didn 't leave the bank? <+++++> No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.
Ross, you know what... <+++++> What?
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Toll-booth. <+++++> What?
Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually,  she should be here by now. <+++++> Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
Oh hey! Wait up! <+++++> Hi!
Oh, little  'X's! Great! That makes up for everything! <+++++> Y 'know, I-I-you've done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?
Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird. <+++++> Hey!
Ross?! <+++++> Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer 's office all I could hear was, "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Look, I just don't want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.
Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. <+++++> Me either...
I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally... <+++++> ...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration?  I could call immigration!
Where were you? <+++++> Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.
Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you. <+++++> What are you doing?
Not really. <+++++> Come on, I'm your older brother, ask me!
Uh huh. <+++++> Oh, you've tasted it.
I 'm in love with you. <+++++> Well that brings me in the loop a little.
Jarvis Oberblau, Cornell.  I mean, the ideas you put forth and, and from someone... so... young... and... . <+++++> Ok... now... now we're just holding hands!
Wow, it 's like a dirty math problem. <+++++> I 'm sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
Oh God! <+++++> Argue with that.
I don 't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!! <+++++> Sweetie, calm down, it 's gonna be okay.
I wish I didn 't have to go. <+++++> Then don 't. Stay here. Just don't go so soon to London, just one more day.
Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's? <+++++> Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign.
Oh, you're right. <+++++> ...and I really think it should be me.
Okay. <+++++> Okay!
Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother. <+++++> Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
Well then why did you give me a ring? <+++++> Wait! Whoa-whoa, you you gave her the ring?
Give me that. <+++++> OK.
Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn 't mind. <+++++> Oh, no, no, no, it 's-it's not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....
Ohh! Fish, seaweed, a sunken ship. <+++++> Things you find in the ocean,  You're gonna be on "Pyramid"!!
You put your fist through the wall? <+++++> No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!
Oh she was looking for you. <+++++> Oh well, I guess I 'll catch up with her later.
Uh-hmm. <+++++> Congratulations.
Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you. <+++++> I know.
Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you 're not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!! <+++++> Oh!!
Alright. Thats it!  <Pushes Amy back> <+++++> Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't time!
Yes you did! What was it? <+++++> Umm, it 's Cutie McPretty.
Aces! <+++++> So uh, he seems like a nice guy.
Monica Gellerrr. <+++++> Right, will you excuse us for one moment?   What are you doing?
Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is,  "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her?  Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?! <+++++> No! No! I didn't do that. It's just Okay, honestly no. I don't, I don't see a big future with her.
Let's not do that any more. <+++++> Hey guys! Hey!
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those <+++++> That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
Yeah! <+++++> Hey Mon.
Because Purvry Perverson over here can 't stop staring at her. <+++++> What?! Chandler she 's our cousin!
Yeah, he thinks that 's my name. <+++++> Well, why don 't you correct him?
Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday! <+++++> Yeah!
You guys, you 're never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole!  Look kinda familiar? <+++++> Apparently Phoebe 's mother also goes by the name Julio.
Why? <+++++> Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
Here, let me.  Rachel Green's line, how may I help you? <+++++> Hi, is Rachel there?
Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now. <+++++> Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here!
Bite me? <+++++> No, no I don 't want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that I'm not mad at you and and that I certainly do not hate you. I just, I just came here to say that.
What? What? Ross, you're scaring me. What's going on? <+++++> Okay, the thing is..
Stop sending food to our apartment. <+++++> Well, why're you all dressed up?
Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine. <+++++> Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin......does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
It's so amazing I met you the same day that Eric broke up with me, because it's like you lose a boyfriend, <+++++> Uh-ah!
You 're still going to that chiropractor, that man couldn't get into medical school in Extapa! <+++++> Thank you! That 's what I keep saying.
I - I have to get on the plane. <+++++> No, you don't.
So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner? <+++++> I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of us. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must know, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace
It's not. <+++++> Or Joseph.
Yesss? <+++++> Hi, I 'm selling Brown Bird cookies.
Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff. <+++++> Whoa! Ohh!!
Hornswoggle?  Ooh, this must be killing you. <+++++> All right, see you later.
She picked those out too. <+++++> How about the place settings?
I paid for those tickets! <+++++> No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
"Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm already there when your playing this message?"  Is that too spooky? <+++++> "Hi Rach, are you there? It's me, pick up. Rachel. Rach!"
Yeah. <+++++> I did, too.
What a baby. <+++++> Total wuss!
No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'. <+++++> I had a 'K'. Where's where's my 'K'?
It 's not the pants. It's you that is backwards. And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all! <+++++> No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please -
A dinosaur died a million years ago? <+++++> Try sixty-five million years ago, and then try sssshhhhhh.... My tenure review board met today and I hear it's looking really good.
Hey! <+++++> How'd the callback go?
What was the book? <+++++> The big book of childrens' names.
You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt! <+++++> I 'm just trying to help you, move on.
Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!! <+++++> What's going on?
No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off. <+++++> When?
I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing. <+++++> Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?
Hey. <+++++> Hey.
Okay, here we go. <+++++> Hello! Can I get you anything?
 <+++++> Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..
Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else? <+++++> Alright.
Oh, I 'm sorry. Ross Tillman. <+++++> No, no-no, Ross Geller.
Joey was in a porno movie. <+++++> Huuh.
Okay, the old hug and roll. <+++++> Yep.
Mommy, I can't find Waldo. <+++++> With the circus? He's behind the elephant.
Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever. <+++++> I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment.  What? What, now?
Hey! <+++++> Guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant! I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you.
What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad. <+++++> Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?
Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we 're going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor 's dog walker?! <+++++> We 're sorry.
I 'm sorry, I can't! <+++++> Yes you can!
Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute. <+++++> Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens, happens. Destiny. <+++++> Three, Two, One!
C'mere, Patti. <+++++> C'mere, Marcel.
Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here? <+++++> Yeah alright.
Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank. <+++++> Oh, hi.
It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel. <+++++> Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?
Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua 's gone so you and Emily are free to go. <+++++> That 's okay. She's still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it's too late to do any of the things I had planned, so
For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport. <+++++> Yay.
I know. I know. I 've feeling <+++++> Yeah?
Well yeah!! <+++++> OH MY GOD!!
Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room. <+++++> No! Why?
Tampa Bay's got a terrible team. <+++++> Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.
That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her?   Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you? <+++++> It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
Hello?  Oh, it's our nanny!  Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye!   That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today? <+++++> No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting?
And you 're so sweet.  And you're kind <+++++> Thanks.
Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do? <+++++> What?
Yeah. <+++++> You had a rough day, uh?
Very bad! <+++++> Very bad.
Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight? <+++++> Oh, I can't. I've got a date with that waitress, Katy, yeah, I know we've been only going out like twice, but I have a really good feeling about her.
I see. <+++++> Besides, there 's a big age difference.
Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat! <+++++> My coat...
I have a little comb. <+++++> Oh. And what do you call that?
Yeah. <+++++> Okay, bye.
I was not! <+++++> No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!
Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister 's mouth long enough to tell me that. <+++++> Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
I 've got a science question. <+++++> Hmm?
Oh hello, Ross. <+++++> Hi, Mrs. Green.
You see, that 's why I did so bad on this test. I'm having a hard time concentrating. When you're up there  and you're teaching and your face gets all serious you look so good.  You wear that tight little turtleneck sweater <+++++> Okay!  Umm, I uh, I 'm your teacher. I'm sorry, you're-you're a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs.
Oh no. No Ross, don 't do this. <+++++> What?
There's this woman, that I like.  A lot.  Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy.  For a long time.  And I could never do that to the guy, y'know?  'Ccause we're really good friends. <+++++> So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh is he a good guy?
Oh, come on Ross... <+++++> No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...
Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe? <+++++> Yeah! Oh my God!
You 're a big scrud. <+++++> What 's a scrud?
Hi! You 're back from your date! <+++++> How are you?
Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow! <+++++> Congratulations! Ohh, that's great!
Well, I, I should go in there. <+++++> No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.
What's that? <+++++> It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!
Ahh! <+++++> Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so
It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right? <+++++> NO! I don't!!
Okay, but try and get Joey too. <+++++> Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?
Uh-huh. <+++++> All right.  I'll uh, I'll see you later, okay?
No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting. <+++++> What?
Hi... I'm Sandy. <+++++> And she's a little mannish...
She's supposed to be with you. <+++++> You're good.
Oh... Oh boy...  Hi... <+++++> Is everything allright?
Ross, you stay here and talk, I 'm gonna go have a baby. <+++++> Okay. Okay.  Umm hi, this is Rachel Green. I 'm Ross Geller. We-we called from the car.
Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her. <+++++> I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!
Listen to me!! <+++++> Juice, I need...
Macadamia nut? <+++++> Umm Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut!
Ross! Phoebe 's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this! <+++++> Well why not?! She 'll-she'll love it! It's the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.
Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy! <+++++> Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!
Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea? <+++++> Yeah. Yeah. A little.
Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way. <+++++> And that wasn't fun for you?
We have heard you play. <+++++> No, you 've heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I'm not going to tell you what song I'm gonna play either. But uh, let's just say when it's over I'll bet there will be a we bit o' celebration.
Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here.  What are you doing? <+++++> Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
That'd be good. <+++++> Alright.  The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming.  Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...
...and live forever as a machine! <+++++> That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing.
Duh-huh! <+++++> I can't believe you hated me.
There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock! <+++++> Oh. Hel-lo!
Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all. <+++++> Yeah, right.
This is so cool,  'til Monica gets back, it's like I'm head chef and I get to make all the decisions. <+++++> Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!
Well, why didn 't you just take a cab? <+++++> Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets it 'll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I? Rockefeller?
Please, don 't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?! <+++++> Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.
So are you gonna tell him? <+++++> Why would I tell him?
Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us. <+++++> I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
Well you 're not selling the story! It's like; it's like you don't believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when I'm preparing for an audition. Okay? I'll set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what you're doing wrong. <+++++> I 'll try that.
Okay. <+++++> I can 't believe you told her I was going to propose!
Well isn 't it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of? <+++++> What did you get?
Who? <+++++> He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.
Go. <+++++> Uh.... bean! Bean!
Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she 's talking about! I am an excellent driver! <+++++> You 're fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
Wait a minute, I can 't give this to her. <+++++> Why not?
Whad'ya mean no? <+++++> No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir.
Hey!! <+++++> Hey!
She didn 't pass. <+++++> What?
Um, there was a Geller Cup? <+++++> Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said,  'nobody won that game, ' and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and....  threw it in the lake.
Oh, that is amazing! <+++++> Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I 'd expect nothing less.
Here, let me try. <+++++> Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.
What? Who? <+++++> The guy you gave your number to.
Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me. <+++++> Noo. Why?
Oh we were, but that was just a , I mean that was just a big drunken mistake. <+++++> You 're back.
Hey guys! Hey! <+++++> Hey.
Two, two babies? <+++++> Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.
What if she jumped out the bassinet? <+++++> Can't hold her own head up, but yeah jumped.
Ohh, absolutely. <+++++> And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.
Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner. <+++++> Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
Making out in your office. <+++++> Shh!  Of course, why don 't we go inside?
Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good. <+++++> I don't even know what that's for.
All right, Ross! <+++++> I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.
Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do. <+++++> That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me?  I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
So what's it gonna be? <+++++> Wait -oh-hey-huh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
Anyway, I've decided to offer you the grant. <+++++> Really?
Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner. <+++++> Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal.
Oh! Oh my God oh! Oh my God she 's here. <+++++> Oh she 's she's perfect.
Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still. <+++++> Yes, tell me.
No, only for sex. <+++++> Thank you.  So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?
Excuse me, I don 't want Greg and Jenny's rejects. <+++++> Rachel won 't talk to me! She won't even open the door!
Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and it bent. <+++++> Yeah.
Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point? <+++++> The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
Oh, she does want to. <+++++> She does want to.
Oh, I got that for him. <+++++> My mommies love me. That's clever.
Shake it off. <+++++> I mean -no, it's just 'cause, it's just 'cause you and I were like a nightmare.  No, but there was some good times.
Oh, please, miss, you don't understand! <+++++> Try to understand!
That 's a good story, Grandpa. <+++++> Hey
Well then you just must have a natural talent for it. <+++++> Y 'know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don't we not speak until then.
Uhh, 11! <+++++> 11, unbelievable 11 is correct.  All right, that 's 4 for the guys. Ladies, you're up.
Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So? <+++++> Oh Pheebs, that 's great. It doesn't count.
I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick. <+++++> It's in Barbados.
Hey. <+++++> Hey!
You told on us? <+++++> Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice.
Da Da. <+++++> Can you say Da-Da? See, I 'm gonna tell your mommies you said it anyway, so you might as well try
Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck, Emma! <+++++> Alright, you know what? You're right. I should at least tell her how I feel.
Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era. <+++++> I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.
Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus , we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us. <+++++> That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!
Honey, honey, I 'm sorry, I know it's our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don't have time to stop. <+++++> Okay, you don 't have to stop, I'm invisible, I'm not here.
Yes! Yes! Unreasonable! <+++++> Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!
Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There 's some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa.  Hey sisters!   Wow, we really are bitches. <+++++> Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when - Oh bloody hell.
I love you too! <+++++> Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!
Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger! <+++++> Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
Monica 's wasted. <+++++> Maybe that will liven up this party.
Phoebe 's a porn star! <+++++> What?!!
Hey, so can you make it on Friday? <+++++> What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?
Hi. <+++++> So uh, Emily just went to the airport.
I 'll be right back. <+++++> You and your ice.
Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too? <+++++> Are you serious?
Sixty guests. <+++++> So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?
God, Susan is so fun! <+++++> Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was
We are going to Dick Clark 's New Year's Rocking Eve! <+++++> Oh my God!
Yeah? <+++++> Good call!
That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic. <+++++> God! I can't believe she saved me for last.  Why are they taking so long?
It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good. <+++++> Yeah... Yeah, that's true.
Okay, see now, what I just heard <+++++> Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.
Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register. <+++++> Go ahead, go ahead with the bird. Ok, do you have anything for around 200?
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!! <+++++> How did you know about that?!
What? <+++++> I gotta go find her.
Oh nothing I Sorry, I just can 't stop crying. <+++++> The doctor says it 's completely normal with all the hormones. Plus, you-you're sleep deprived.
Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake? <+++++> Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.
Bye. <+++++> Good night.
Well it 's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories. <+++++> Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
Not me. <+++++> Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.
Weekend at Bernie 's. <+++++> Correct. In what part of her body did Monica get a pencil stuck at age 14?
Hey. <+++++> Hey.
Chandler M. Bing? <+++++> Yeah-ha!
I'm sorry, but I can't say. <+++++> Wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines.
Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!! <+++++> Well, hello Rachel!
Oh, I don 't know, I guess, Chris O'Donnel, John F. Kennedy, Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson. <+++++> Spiderman?
Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? <+++++> No. No.
Yeah. <+++++> So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!
Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love... <+++++> Awww!
Okay. <+++++> Okay.
But Rachel has an apartment. <+++++> Yeah, but when the baby comes she 's gonna want to move.
Oh... okay, just hide! <+++++> Rach?
One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis... WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've not finished counting!! <+++++> You sprayed my front twice!
Hi! How are you? <+++++> We're fine, we're fine.
Hey. <+++++> Hi. Mom. Dad.
Hi. <+++++> Hey.
Hey. <+++++> You mean that?
What?! I just touched him and he went over. <+++++> Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough.
Yeah I guess you're right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks. <+++++> The Divorcer, to the rescue!
Oh my God! <+++++> Yes!
Well it stupid, unfair question! <+++++> Don't blame the questions!
They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat? <+++++> It gives it a nice antiquey look.
No, it 's really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe. <+++++> Help! Help!! Help! Help!!
I will sit with you Dr. Geller. <+++++> Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y 'know what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath.  I'm Ross! I'm divorced, and I have a kid!
Hi, Ross. <+++++> Yeah, huh.
Yeah! <+++++> It's, uh... it's endearing, really.
Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk! <+++++> I would never do that!
Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you 're gonna have the baby and I don't want to lose again! <+++++> What?! While she 's been going through this hell, you've been making money?! You're betting on your friend staying in this misery?!
All right, let 's go! <+++++> You 're welcome.
Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now? <+++++> Sorry.
Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he 's wrong. <+++++> You think?
No, none at all. You need to be happy with whoever is in your home... Although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem? Maybe it's something I can work on in the future. <+++++> No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's uhm... my issue.
Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it. <+++++> Oke-dokey.
Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he 's 'Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!' <+++++> First of all it 's Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn't fly.
Okay Ross come on let 's just forget about the condoms. <+++++> Oh well I may as well have!
Ooh, actually I 've been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this! <+++++> Oh.  Wow!  Huh.  Boy!  Well, someone 's been doing their homework.
Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me! <+++++> So that 's the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
I see him, you guys are just the worst hiders ever. <+++++> Hey Pete.
No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage? <+++++> Didn 't you spend last night at Joey's?
Very good. <+++++> Rachel! What are you doing here?
You're going to China? <+++++> Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the bo -it's-it's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary . Um... here's a picture of me...
Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I 'll have you fired. What you heard was, "Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!" <+++++> Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain
Ross, are you there? Ross, I don 't know if you can hear this but  I'm gonna talk anyway, uh, I'm in the States with you sister and your friends and it's all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you-Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you. <+++++> I love you too! I 'm, I'm gonna call you right now from the phone booth!  You can't hear me.
Oh honey, this is for the best, thus I'm not distracted, worrying about Emma, how she's doing at home and I'm being completely here with you and, oh, she spit up! <+++++> What?
Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl. <+++++> Oh.  Hey, who's Carl?
I see. <+++++> Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this?
Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet? <+++++> Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.
Yeah, but that was different. Y 'know? I mean, we were, we were going out then, now I think it's weird. <+++++> Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.
No! <+++++> OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.
Ok, careful. <+++++> Ok.
Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it! <+++++> I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand.
How do you know about that? <+++++> Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to sleep...
Hey Ross! <+++++> Hi.
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage? <+++++> Oh, come on!
What I said was, was that I understood. Joey 's the one who agreed with you! <+++++> Okay.
Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!! <+++++> I didn 't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn't finish the whole letter!
How could it not matter?! <+++++> How was I supposed to know we 'd end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink,  'cause I'm heading up there. <+++++> Uh, yeah, I 'll take a coffee. Thanks, man.
Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What's wrong with us? You know when people hear about our situation they <+++++> Uh, clearly.
All right, I 'm off to see your dad. <+++++> Whoa-whoa, aren 't you a little over dressed?
Well, I-I-I 've been on Standby for a flight home for hours. <+++++> Oh.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!! <+++++> Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.
Okay, go ahead. <+++++> Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
Oh! <+++++> Eww! No!! Her ear! All right, Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
Hi. <+++++> Hey.
' I am Bea. ' <+++++> Okay.
Hi! <+++++> Hey!
Yeah.  Why aren 't you with Rachel? <+++++> Are you kidding? Look, we 're not gonna be together just because we're having a baby. Okay?
That 's right. <+++++> Y 'know of-officer I uh I had the weirdest dream last night
What? <+++++> What, you, you really quit your job?
How long since you 've seen a girl naked? <+++++> I was backpacking across Western Europe.
Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright. <+++++> Hi everyone.
Uh, four. <+++++> Four.
Well, you 're-you're sweating. <+++++> These-these are beads of joy.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
You do? <+++++> I do.
Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus! <+++++> I knew that was him!
What about AndrÃÂÃÂ©? <+++++> Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.
Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom! <+++++> We're rehearsing a Greek play.
This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish. <+++++> Hi.
well you not what you should feel terrible about, this could have been my serious guy he was sweet and smart and funny. Do you know how hard it is to meet a guy like that? <+++++> We are a rare breed.
Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge! <+++++> Why?!
Okay, what is in here? Rocks? <+++++> No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok? <+++++> He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine!
Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding! <+++++> I can't believe this is happening.
Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples. <+++++> At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.
Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes! <+++++> So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?
Listen, we both know you 're gonna do it 'cause you're not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car. <+++++> No, Rachel doesn 't want me to....
Oh! <+++++> Ok!... All right, thanks! Thank you so much, you guys!  Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!
Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue... <+++++> C'mon! C'mon!
That's fair... Although, can I ask... why do you think that is? <+++++> Why... I... I don't know.  Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?
Easy tiger. <+++++> I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it 's-it's so great. But at the same time I'm thinking, "Well, I'm gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."
Monica. <+++++> It would really help when I'm kissing you if you didn't shout out my sister's name.
Got it! <+++++> Oh my God it 's just like I dreamed it!
Thank you for a delightful stay. <+++++> Oh, my maple candy!
Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave?  Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?! <+++++> Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!
Really?! <+++++> Really.
What are you guys doing out here? <+++++> Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
We 're so sorry. <+++++> That 's all right, we-we don't need you. In fact, hey I'm over it already.
See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you? <+++++> I just grabbed a spoon.
Because! You could get to live out my fantasy! <+++++> You had fantasies about Emily?
So, I got the results of the amnio today. <+++++> Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....?
So I guess Rachel had you baby? <+++++> Yep, can you believe it?
I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls at the party, GOD! <+++++> Why do you care so much?
Ok... "Emma just said gleba"! <+++++> It's not a word!
It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy. <+++++> Are you serious?
I didn't know that. <+++++> Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.
Really?! <+++++> Well if it doesn 't matter to her, it doesn't matter to me!  Still not yelling!
So fellas <+++++> Yeah!
Carol Lesbian? <+++++> Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?
Ross. <+++++> Oh, come on you guys; that 's funny! Y'know? Because he's need-he's got like a hearing aide y'know, 'cause-'cause y'know, 'cause he's all old, and
Damnit! <+++++> Rach? Hi!
Wow! I don 't know, maybe. I'm <+++++> Oh-oh, Rach! I was just messin ' around!  Like you did last night when I had to pee?
"...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody.." <+++++> Everybody!
Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they don 't even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box! <+++++> Evidently they do.
I know what you're thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny! <+++++> I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.
No! You don 't want to wreck it, you don't want to go to fast! <+++++> Yeah, no, you 're right, I know, you're right, I'm not, I'm not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys.
Shhhh! <+++++> What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal. <+++++> Yeah? How much?
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel? <+++++> It used to be. Now she doesn 't really have a face. Smokin' body though.
Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. <+++++> She is a kook.
Are you okay? <+++++> Come on, let 's go!
Aw what are you?! A detective? <+++++> Look I-I don 't know what's going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.
Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room?  Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already?  Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons. <+++++> What did you get?
Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants? <+++++> Well ah, actually...
Hey, so how is it? <+++++> I broke my thumb.
We 're not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children and I still do, so that's why we're just gonna be friends. <+++++> Naked friends.
New York. <+++++> The big apple!
I got glasses! <+++++> Well, you-you 've always had glasses.
So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I 'm just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit. <+++++> Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?
Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself. <+++++> Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
Yeah -Ooh! Earrings! <+++++> A date?! She 's-she's got a date?! With who?
huh.  What's the difference between beer and lager? <+++++> I don't know. We could look it up.
Yeah, but it-it-it 's my whole life-you come to England. <+++++> No, I can 't. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can't leave him. Isn't-you don't think there's any way?
You are gonna be fine, believe me. <+++++> Uh-oh...
No, come on, I'm totally ok.  I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own. <+++++> Still-still, let me come... for me.
I guess I didn 't really think about it. <+++++> Ezel!  Hey Gunther! You 're an ezel!
Mmm-mm. <+++++> I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash.  So-so what I am saying is - is is that  is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!
Yeah, so? <+++++> Wow!
I mean maybe you didn 't hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua? <+++++> Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn 't realise that had become anything, yet.
Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay. <+++++> Umm, jealous!
Hi! How 'd it go? <+++++> Oh great! We 're going out again Saturday. But I just found she's also seeing some other guy.
Hi Ben! <+++++> Wow! You-you look great!
No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party. <+++++> Hey, here's a theme
Really? <+++++> Mmmm.
Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl. <+++++> Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.
Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it? <+++++> Which... which... which... Which one is it?
Gert! <+++++> That 's, that's pretty.  Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing there Gert?
Let me get you some coffee. <+++++> Thanks.
Thank God. <+++++> Yeah, she 's fired.
So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. <+++++> Rach!
I know I should 've.  "I'm sorry." <+++++> Not using it right, Joe.
That sounds fair. <+++++> Maybe I 'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street
Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems like yesterday they just got engaged. <+++++> I know. Hey remember remember the night they got engaged? How uh, you and I almost
You gotta hear this, it's great... It's like free porn! <+++++> Weh...sigh
Hey, Ross, Bodington's! <+++++> Yeah!
Well, I guess that's all in the past, now. <+++++> Hmmm-mmmm.
You're hurt! <+++++> ...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!!
