Mornin ' <+++++> Mornin '
Okay, I 'll just put a little more booze on there. <+++++> I think, subconsciously
Okay, the next situation is for Rachel. The wedding is about to start you walk into the back room and you find Monica taking a nap with Ross.  I 'll be Monica. Go! <+++++> No! No! No!
Yay! <+++++> It 's Ben and his Da-Da. Da-Da? Can you say Da-Da? Y'know, you might as well say it because I told your
Da Da. <+++++> Can you say Da-Da? See, I 'm gonna tell your mommies you said it anyway, so you might as well try
Da Da. <+++++> Huh?
What are you guys doing? <+++++> Nothing.
Action! <+++++> That tastes like feet!
I 'm sorry <+++++> Excuse me, what?
Monica 's gotta have the phone in the right place and- <+++++> All right! All right! All right!  We are fixing it.
Hi. <+++++> So uh, Emily just went to the airport.
Oh. Why didn 't you take her? <+++++> Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y 'know, we- we said our good-byes this morning, so
You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn! <+++++> Nah.
Hey, cheer up! You 're gonna see her again, right? <+++++> Well I, that 's the thing, I don't know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said,  "This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let's just enjoy "
No-no-no, don 't-don't do the accent. You've got to see her again. <+++++> And why do you care so much?
Because! You could get to live out my fantasy! <+++++> You had fantasies about Emily?
No! Y 'know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together. <+++++> Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything! <+++++> Ahh.
Do you love her? <+++++> We said it was only going to be two weeks, y 'know?
You love her! <+++++> What-what is love really?
Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You 're probably just gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate. You're gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And she's gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud. <+++++> I am a good kisser.
This is the boarding call for Flight 009. <+++++> Emily!
Oh my God! What are you doing here? <+++++> I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.
You are so sweet. <+++++> That 's, that's, that's a big candy bar.  I had the most amazing time with you.
Well, that ' me.  Here, have this.  I'm only allowed one piece of carryon anyway. <+++++> Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm, I 've been thinking, I'm just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.
Oh.  Thank you. <+++++> That 's no problem.
Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her? <+++++> I did.
And well, what did she say? <+++++> Thank you.
Oh, you 're totally welcome! What'd she say? <+++++> She said,  "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she said, "Thank you."
Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?! <+++++> What do I do now?
You play hard to get. <+++++> She already lives in London.
It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn 't, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go! <+++++> Okay! Okay! But if she doesn 't call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y'know just to she what's going on, and, and she says she'll call me back, but then she doesn't. Then it 's over.
Ross. <+++++> Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?
It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things. <+++++> No, no, that-that, that 's all right. Umm, I'm just glad you called.
Ross umm, there 's something that I've got to tell you, there's-there's someone else. <+++++> Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
This isn 't how it's supposed to go, there can't be another guy. <+++++> Well
Of course there 's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love! <+++++> I 'm not proving anything. Okay, I'm done listening to you. If I hadn't let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would've put my fist through the wall!
You put your fist through the wall? <+++++> No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!
You have to go to London! <+++++> What?
When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do? <+++++> I made fun of his accent.
You sat back and let him have her, you didn 't fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily? <+++++> No.
All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily!  That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London! <+++++> Really?
Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don 't let her go without a fight! <+++++> All right. All right, I 'm gonna do it!
All right. <+++++> I 'm gonna, I'm gonna go to London and I'm going to fight for her.
Hello. <+++++> Hey.
All right. When is, when is the next flight out? <+++++> About four hours.
Ross, are you there? Ross, I don 't know if you can hear this but  I'm gonna talk anyway, uh, I'm in the States with you sister and your friends and it's all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you-Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you. <+++++> I love you too! I 'm, I'm gonna call you right now from the phone booth!  You can't hear me.
I wish I could know if you 'd heard any of that. I suppose I've either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if you're listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there's not much chance you did heard that, and there's the call waiting so, I should go. Oh well.  Hello. <+++++> Hi.
Ross, I love you! <+++++> Ohh! Thank you.
Because I need the money, and I thought that it 'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect. <+++++> Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don't think Mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do.
Hello. <+++++> Hey!
Well, it's good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius. <+++++> The volcano?
Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War? <+++++> Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country. <+++++> With such a sad history.
Are you sure you wanna do this? <+++++> Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
Ohhh! <+++++> Why are we in bed together?
I don 't know. Do-do you have any clothes on? <+++++> Yeah.
Really?! <+++++> No! But we-we didn 't have sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don't remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot. <+++++> And we didn 't have sex.
Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I 'm just glad we didn't do anything stupid. <+++++> Tell me about it.
No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable. <+++++> Hey!
Hey! <+++++> What?
I don 't know.  What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night. <+++++> Yeah!
You did. <+++++> What?! Hello! We didn 't get married.
No, we didn 't get married! That's ridiculous! <+++++> We-we-we -I remember being in a chapel.
Oh my God. <+++++> I -They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one 's free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free. <+++++> Laugh it up, but the joke 's on you. Because we don't need to get divorced, okay? We we're just gonna get an annulment.
Oh-oh, that 's your thing. <+++++> What?
You 're thing. You're thing. Y'know? You're the guy who gets divorced. <+++++> Oh yeah!
Oh yeah! <+++++> No-no, that 's-that's not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!
Hey, hubby! <+++++> Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?
Uh-huh. <+++++> I 'm not going to do that.
Okay! So, we 'll just stay married. <+++++> Yes, exactly!
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller! <+++++> Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I 'd have to talk you into this more.
Okay, see now I 'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding. <+++++> I 'm-I'm not kidding. Look I-I, I can't have three failed marriages. I can 't. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
What-wh-what so we 'll just stay married forever?! <+++++> Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It 's right next to it!
Ohh, okay, I 'm sorry. You're right. Y'know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you 're asking of me. <+++++> I 'm asking you to do me a favor.
You are asking me to be your wife! <+++++> And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
Hey! <+++++> Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married.  We register, and you get to keep all the presents!
No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married. <+++++> I don 't know if it's true.
Oh b-b-but it is! <+++++> Oh, okay, y 'know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...
Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world 's worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will! <+++++> All right. All right, I 'll do it.
Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment? <+++++> Oh, yeah, no problems. It 's all taken care of.
Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie? <+++++> Oh yeah, why not?
Okay, umm, I 'm gonna get my sweater. <+++++> Okay.  You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
Always. <+++++> I didn 't get the annulment.
What?! <+++++> We 're still married! Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there. <+++++> You ever figure out what that thing's for?
Can you hold on a moment? I have another call.  I love her. <+++++> I know.
Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off. <+++++> Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."
I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table. <+++++> Oh my god. You are pure evil.
Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this. <+++++> Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.
I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing. <+++++> Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?
Yeah, someplace nice.  How much do you think I can get for my kidney? <+++++> I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods. <+++++> That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.
We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy. <+++++> Go over there and tell that woman the truth.
All right. <+++++> Go.
No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today. <+++++> Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--
Who is also in charge of purchasing. <+++++> Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--
Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there. <+++++> Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--
Let's see! <+++++> That's fine, I'll just wait!
Sorry, sorry. <+++++> Monica!
Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon.  I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade? <+++++> Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number. <+++++> Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?
Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns. <+++++> That sounds great. Same for me.
Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you? <+++++> Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.
Um, everyone? <+++++> Oh, you're right, I'm sorry.
Thank you. <+++++> Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay.
Oh, thank you! <+++++> So five of us is, $33.50 apiece.
I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just... <+++++> Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal.
You can tell us. <+++++> Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine.
Ok. <+++++> I hear ya.
Well, then...Let's. <+++++> I, I just never think of money as an issue.
That's 'cause you have it. <+++++> That's a good point.
'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla. <+++++> Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?
If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift. <+++++> G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish. <+++++> Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.
No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert. <+++++> No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together.
Together. <+++++> Not at the concert.
Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe. <+++++> Whoo!
Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you. <+++++> But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?
By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall. <+++++> Come on.
So...Thank you. <+++++> Could you be less enthused?
Charity? <+++++> We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.
Actually, it makes us feel that big. <+++++> I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.
Fine. <+++++> Fine.
All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then. <+++++> Chandler!
Yeah? <+++++> Geez! Are you ready?
Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today. <+++++> Whoa! You had sex today?
Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming. <+++++> Wow.
Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign. <+++++> Still doing the screening thing?
It was just so awkward and bumpy. <+++++> Bumpy?
You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this. <+++++> Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
So, let's go. <+++++> Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
That was amazing! <+++++> Excellent, that was excellent.
I can't believe the guys missed this. <+++++> What guys? Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band. <+++++> Ross.
How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad? <+++++> Hey, you guys.
Happy birthday. <+++++> Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?
Uh, good. <+++++> Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
What party? <+++++> It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.
Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, "hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck". <+++++> Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.
So how did everything go? <+++++> Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.
Well, we've gotta go. <+++++> Ok.
Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us. <+++++> Oh, you and me?
The other us. <+++++> Ok.
We're uh, we're getting married. <+++++> As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married?
Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to. <+++++> Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.
Look I just thought that... <+++++> No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!
Is your finger caught in that chair? <+++++> Mmm hmmm.
Want us to go? <+++++> Uh-huh.
Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast. <+++++> Yes!
They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it? <+++++> Would it matter?
Are you really not going? <+++++> I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?
They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them. <+++++> If you wanna call that a reason.
Ross, I thought you were over this. <+++++> Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.
That's great! <+++++> Excellent!
That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect. <+++++> No no, that's me.
Oh, yeah. <+++++> Oh, hello.
Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh... <+++++> Is everything ok?
Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today. <+++++> Oh my god.
Ok, who ordered what? <+++++> Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.
Oh hello, Ross. <+++++> Hi, Mrs. Green.
Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them. <+++++> And you had no idea they weren't getting along?
Fine, whatever. <+++++> What's the matter?
Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding. <+++++> What?
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish. <+++++> Carol, what's the matter? What happened?
My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming. <+++++> Oh my god.
I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything. <+++++> It's ok. I'm sorry.
And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do. <+++++> I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.
You do? <+++++> Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.
Of course I do. <+++++> Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.
Thank you. <+++++> Any time.
Would you look at them? <+++++> Yeah, can't help but.
How you doin'? <+++++> Ok.
You did a good thing today. <+++++> Yeah.
You wanna dance? <+++++> No, that's fine.
Come on. I'll let you lead. <+++++> Ok.
Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married? <+++++> Well, Mon, I was married.
Does anyone have one from a different paper? Ross, read yours. <+++++> I don't want to.
Joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about. <+++++> Yeah.
Maybe they do. I've been doin' this ten years and I haven't gotten anywhere. There's gotta be a reason. <+++++> Oh c'mon. Maybe you're just, uhhh... paying your dues.
Are... are you OK? <+++++> Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he?
Maybe. <+++++> Don't toy with me.
Geller! <+++++> Hey, Fun Bobby!
Hey. Whoa, hey, you've been working out, huh? <+++++> Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!
So what. So he drank a lot tonight. <+++++> Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.
Oh, my, oh! <+++++> What? What's wrong?
She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning. <+++++> Alright.
Hi. <+++++> Hi.
Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's? <+++++> Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's?
Actually, I'm a... kind of a.... you know, a... date-type... thing... of Rachel's. <+++++> A date.
Yeah, I'm her date. <+++++> Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.
Oh, you are the, uh... paleontologist. <+++++> Yes, yes I am. And you are a....
See? They're as different as night and... later that night. <+++++> Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage. It was nice, nice... uh... meeting you.
Oh. <+++++> Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.
Well, we're not seeing each other, so.... <+++++> Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...
Well, yeah, this is the deal. <+++++> OK, well, um, have a nice evening.
Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating? <+++++> What do you mean?
Do you not see it? <+++++> See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.
Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it? <+++++> ....................Yeah.
Dysprosium. <+++++> 
I know what your problem is. <+++++> Oh you do, do you?
Um-hum, you're jealous. <+++++> Of... of what?
You're jealous because I'm a real doctor. <+++++> Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.
Hey, you listen. <+++++> No, no, let me finish.
No, let me finish. <+++++> No, you let me fini...
Morning. <+++++> Where ya goin'?
Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember? <+++++> Ooooohhhh.
What's with all the bottles of liquor? <+++++> What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?
Hey! <+++++> How'd the callback go?
Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way. <+++++> Good for you.
Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking? <+++++> You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.
Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger. <+++++> Huuh.
You bitch. <+++++> Whip it out, whip it out.
I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin. <+++++> Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?
I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again. <+++++> Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin.
Joey was in a porno movie. <+++++> Huuh.
If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me. <+++++> You were in a porno?
That is wild. <+++++> 
Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area? <+++++> You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?
OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband. <+++++> 
Hey. <+++++> Hey.
Hey, c'mon, cut it out. <+++++> Hey?
What? <+++++> Can I ask you somethin'?
Sure. <+++++> Naa.
What? C'mon, talk to me. <+++++> OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex?
Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex? <+++++> Technically, huh, no.
Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school? <+++++> No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .
No, no no no, don't need to know the details. <+++++> It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird.
No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think? <+++++> What?
I think it's sexy. <+++++> Sexy?
Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex. <+++++> No kidding?
Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do? <+++++> What?
I'd wait. <+++++> You'd wait?
Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more. <+++++> Really?
Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That just means it's working. <+++++> Women really want this?
Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright. <+++++> Hi everyone.
Hi. <+++++> 
Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing? <+++++> Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
What did, what did he say? <+++++> Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . .
What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie. <+++++> Pop it in.
Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see. <+++++> What's wrong with people having sex?
All I say is, she better get the job. <+++++> Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
Boy that Julie's a talker, huh? <+++++> Goodnight.
So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. . . <+++++> Oh, no no, I am.
Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous? <+++++> Um, no, I uh, I have done it before.
Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce? <+++++> I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens.
OK, gook luck. <+++++> Wha, uhh, what?
Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from. <+++++> OK, now I'm nervous.
Maybe you should put it off. <+++++> No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I mean, really happy. I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know.
I know, yeah, sorry. <+++++> What, it's not your fault.
Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that. <+++++> Really?
Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen. <+++++> 
And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening. <+++++> Ohh. . . Thanks Rach, goodnight.
Well, somebody got some last night. <+++++> Twice.
Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are! <+++++> Hey!
I 'll take a coffee.  So how was your big date last night? <+++++> Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.
Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off? <+++++> I guess so.
So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes! <+++++> No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
Oh, slides.  So really nothing happened. <+++++> Something could 've happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
Right. Was it the,  "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?" <+++++> Anyway, if she, if she wasn 't in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?
She asked-asked you out again? <+++++> Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine 's Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean.
Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can 't! I can't! I can't! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can't. It's just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can't do it! I can't do it. <+++++> Okay! Okay! Okay! It 's okay.  It's okay. Hey, it's too weird for you, I won't see her again.
Thank you. I yeah. <+++++> I mean after tomorrow night.
No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can 't! I can't do it!  It's just gonna freak me out!!! <+++++> Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I 'll-I'll tell her tonight I can't see her anymore.
Ross thanks. <+++++> You want me to call her right now?
Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that 's-that's crazy-I mean that's crazy. So what's-what's going on with you? What is going on with you? <+++++> Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
Do I have my own castle? <+++++> Hey! Uh, Phoebe 's not here is she?
Phoebe 's a porn star! <+++++> What?!!
Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker. <+++++> And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn 't know he was in there.
No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe 's our friend! Well, I'm not gonna watch it! <+++++> Yeah! Good for you Joe!
Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I know we 're not supposed to see each other anymore and I'm okay with that, it's just that I don't know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to about it. <+++++> Of course, what happened?
I don 't want to talk about it. <+++++> Okay, umm
But you know what might really cheer me up? <+++++> What?
Seeing some more of your super-cool slides. <+++++> Wow! Really?!
Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand. <+++++> Well, I 'd love to! Here, you wait right here and I'll go get the projector and my notes!
Oh great! Thanks Ross, you 're such a good friend! <+++++> Ohh!
Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol! <+++++> Uh okay, well there 's-there's wine in the kitchen.
Oh great! <+++++> Hello?
What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?! <+++++> O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she 's really upset we're just talking.
Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me! <+++++> So that 's the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me! <+++++> Y 'know what? I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later. Good-bye.  Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you're just using me.
Hey. <+++++> You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
Oh! I knew it! What happened? <+++++> Umm, she kissed me.
Shhhh!!! <+++++> Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
Well, it doesn 't sound like it! I mean, it's pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don't kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing! <+++++> Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn 't stop it. I guess I-I just wasn't thinking
Yeah that 's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about! <+++++> Oh wait -hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister 's mouth long enough to tell me that. <+++++> Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
What?! <+++++> No, I mean, look I don 't know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don't want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
Wow. I, I don 't even know what to say. Thank you. <+++++> You 're welcome.
And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you? <+++++> You take care Jill.
Yesss!! <+++++> Who 's Chip?
Chip, is Chip Matthews. <+++++> The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute. <+++++> Monica, you 're so lucky! He's like the most popular guy in school!!
I know!!   Chip? Hi! It 's Monica.  'Kay.  'Kay.  Okay.  Okay, good-bye.  Oh my God, we just had the best conversation!! <+++++> I was just leaving.
Good!  'Cause I've got a product report to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I don't fall asleep. <+++++> Why? Did you write it?
Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants? <+++++> Well ah, actually...
I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy. <+++++> Well, umm, why don 't you give him a call?
Okay.  Are you sure you wanna hear this? <+++++> Oh, I 'm sure.
Chip! Hi, it 's Rachel.  Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message.  Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down.  Monica Geller.  Ohh. <+++++> Oh, that 's right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that's gotta be embarrassing!
...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!!   Thank you, thanks. <+++++> Hey, here 's a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?
Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land. <+++++> I 'm reading your ad.
Looks good, uh? <+++++> Yeah.
Yeah, I actually don 't know... <+++++> Good, so do I
No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself. <+++++> Are you sure she 's in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma's glycoma medicine again?
Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive. <+++++> So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
Well, I 'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word. <+++++> So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe 's mom remind anyone of a cat?
Ross, don 't start. <+++++> Come on, you-you can 't tell me you actually believe that-that there's a woman inside that cat!
I believe it. <+++++> No you don 't.
Yes, I do. <+++++> No you do -y'know what, you're not gonna suck me into this.
Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right. <+++++> I do not always have to be -okay, okay.
You guys, you 're never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole!  Look kinda familiar? <+++++> Apparently Phoebe 's mother also goes by the name Julio.
Do we have to tell her? <+++++> Yes, we have to tell her!
Oh, but it 's made her so happy. <+++++> Little girl misses her cat.  Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.  Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
Yeah. <+++++> Thank you.
Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he 's wrong. <+++++> You think?
I know! <+++++> Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?
Oh, they said uh,  "You don't have insurance here, so stop calling us." <+++++> You didn 't tell her?!  Okay, fine! Pheebs?
Yeah?  Hi! <+++++> Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.
That 's a good call. Right. <+++++> No! No! Look -Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!
Ross, how many parents have you lost? <+++++> None.
Okay, then you don 't know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I'm wrong, who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive. <+++++> I 'm sorry.
Okay. <+++++> I don 't know what to say.
I think she would like that. <+++++> Come here, here, come here, come here,  Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend 's mother.
Me too. <+++++> Oh! Y'know, I 've got an extra futon.
Hi guys! <+++++> Hey!
Hey, what have you guys been up too? <+++++> Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.
My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting. <+++++> Yeah.
I uh, I got it from the gift shop. They have really lax security there.  It 's a joke. <+++++> Bye.
Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time. <+++++> Oh yeah, she 's-she's amazing. And-and she's so much fun. And! Y'know what? When I'm with her, I'm fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes.  She's leaving in two days, I don't have to do it.
Oh no, two days, you must be bummed. <+++++> Yeah, she 's got to go back to London. But you know what? I've been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that's it. Y'know.
Yes, but in Ross 's case, they both know in two weeks that 's it. <+++++> Pheebs!
Hey! <+++++> Hello! Hello!
We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it 's actually for Joshua.  Look, he said he's not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him! <+++++> Well, as much as I 'd like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren't going to be here. All right? I mean, she's going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I've got a whole special evening planned. So I'm sorry, no party.
You 're so sweet! And I'm so surprised! <+++++> You really didn 't know?
You okay?  You all right? <+++++> So we should probably get going soon.
Oh, but the party 's only just getting started! <+++++> Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y 'know, then The Plaza for dinner.
So why did you plan a party at the same time? <+++++> No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It 's usually, "Surprise!" And then, "Oh my God, I'm so surprised-good-bye!"
But Ross, I 'm such having a great time! Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make- believe tea parties. <+++++> Monica said that did she?
What? You 're leaving?! <+++++> Yes, we have something we have to get to.
No! You guys can 't leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned! <+++++> What big thing?
I 'll go. <+++++> Yay!
What are the odds? What are the odds? <+++++> Okay, that-that 's enough! Y'know, let's, let's let someone else play.
Oh my God!! The baby just kicked! <+++++> Ohh!
It 's okay! It's okay! It kicked once, it'll kick again! <+++++> Oh my God!
Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good -bye cheer. So okay!  Ready! Okay! Gimme an 'E!' <+++++> E!
Gimme an  'M!' <+++++> M!
Gimme an  'I!' <+++++> I!
Gimme an  'L!' <+++++> L!
Gimme a  'Y!' <+++++> Y!
Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua 's gone so you and Emily are free to go. <+++++> That 's okay. She's still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it's too late to do any of the things I had planned, so
Oh, Ross, I 'm sorry. I completely ruined your evening. <+++++> Yeah.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself. <+++++> Helps a little.
Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser? <+++++> Yeah, have a seat.
I 'm so sorry. <+++++> That 's okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn't want it to end this way, y'know?
Well, maybe you didn 't want it to end? <+++++> What do you mean?
You seem to really like her. <+++++> Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y 'know no commitment.
Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica 's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks. <+++++> You think?
Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you 're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip. <+++++> Hey, you 're right.
Yeah. <+++++> Thanks.  What photo album was it?
I don 't know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids. <+++++> Oh my God! Those weren 't albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!
Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year. <+++++> Ohh, Geller 's got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh!  It's the classic struggle between man and- Someone knocked over a lamp.
That 's all right. Hey you guys, you know what's going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?" <+++++> Great!
How does going to a strip club help him better? <+++++> Because there are naked ladies there.
Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women. <+++++> There are naked ladies there too.
Y 'know, I can't believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I'm never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants! <+++++> Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take  'em off and we'll have some fun.
Hey-hey! <+++++> Hi!
Hey! <+++++> Catch any big fish?
Oh my God, you guys have no idea. <+++++> Oh! God! Wow!
You stink! <+++++> Are you kidding?!
Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how 's he doing? <+++++> He hasn 't gotten out of that chair in two days.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Ohh!  Hi! <+++++> Hi!
So . <+++++> No.
No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please! <+++++> You want me to take some girl I 've never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.
I 'll be right there!  Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we've gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me? <+++++> All right, I 'll do it.
I 'll get her. <+++++> Please hurry.
Ross! Come quickly! There 's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard! <+++++> I 've gotta go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Hey -ooh so, how was Vermont? <+++++> Emily is incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it, I mean the whole weekend was like a dream.  Oh! And you! Rach!
Oh, hey! <+++++> Hey! You were so right!
What? <+++++> Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be happy for each other.
Oh, hmm. <+++++> I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn 't quite there. Y'know, I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy
Joshua. <+++++> Joshua guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kinda y'know.
Yeah, I <+++++> But now! I 'm there! I'm totally there! I'm-I'm finally where you are!
Oh, thank goodness! <+++++> Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily.
Oh, no problem. I 'm so glad I could help. Happy for you. <+++++> Happy for you.
Hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment? <+++++> Oh, yeah, no problems. It 's all taken care of.
Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie? <+++++> Oh yeah, why not?
Okay, umm, I 'm gonna get my sweater. <+++++> Okay.  You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
Always. <+++++> I didn 't get the annulment.
What?! <+++++> We 're still married! Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go!   You didn't get the annulment?!! <+++++> I know.
Ross?! <+++++> Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer 's office all I could hear was, "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Look, I just don't want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.
Don 't be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y'know? Mine's gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive. <+++++> Look, all I know is I-I can 't have another failed marriage!
So okay what? You 're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?!-Op, woman! Sorry. <+++++> Well, okay so, I don 't have it all worked out quite yet. Just don't say anything to Rachel, please?
Ooh! That 's good! Wow! But now if you were pregnant, what would you name it? Hint <+++++> Hey! Hi!
Hey! <+++++> What 's up?
Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together. <+++++> Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friend shaking up. Oh, that's great. That's great.
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn 't seem so bad? <+++++> Bye.
Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?! <+++++> Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody 's stairs!
Ross, it 's not that big a deal! So you'll been divorced three times, you'll still have a life, you'll go on dates <+++++> No! No, I won 't! I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.
Ross, you 're being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces! <+++++> Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
Y 'know that's really fair. Y'know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I'll show you! Come here. <+++++> What?! Why?
Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn 't you date him? <+++++> And if you wait right here, I 'll go get Ross.
Well, I don 't care about the divorces either, but I wouldn't date him. It's just that he's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl. <+++++> What?!
She said,  "He's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl." <+++++> This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now , she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you- will you help me out here?
Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her. <+++++> We were drunk! I would 've married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!
Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!! <+++++> Look, I 'm sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don 't want to be divorced three times.
Yes, and now he 's using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say,  "Well done!" Bravo Meg. <+++++> Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I 'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth--Nothing!!
You got married again. <+++++> Yes.
So that 's your second marriage in two years. <+++++> Yes, second in two years. Third overall.
Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. Why don 't you tell me what happened. <+++++> Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk
I 'm sorry, is this the same Rachel who's name you said at the altar in the second marriage? <+++++> Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.
Oh, that 's better then. <+++++> This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
I see. Have you considered therapy? <+++++> I think just the annulment for today.
There are a couple of forms to fill out. <+++++> Easy.
And we 'll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind. <+++++> No problem.
And we 'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge. <+++++> Ooh! There 's no way to do this without her? 'Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
Of course you did. Look Ross, you can 't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there. <+++++> Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel?  I will think about the therapy.
Okay, bye! <+++++> Oh no.
So? Did you get the annulment? <+++++> I couldn 't.
I knew it! Because you love Rachel. <+++++> It 's not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I
Yeah, complicated  'cause of the love. <+++++> I I do, I do not love Rachel. I 'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
I 've never been more convinced of your love for her. <+++++> I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?!
Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing. <+++++> Oh my -Come here! Come here!  It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.
Thank you. <+++++> Of course.
Hi! <+++++> Hey!
No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no. <+++++> Why 'd you say no?
Fine! All right, I 'll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y'know, start to say something stupid. <+++++> Just then or-or all the time,  'cause we-we have jobs y'know.
Hey! <+++++> Shhh! We 're not talking.
Oh yeah, I 'd actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea. <+++++> Uh, double latte, extra foam.
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much? <+++++> Come on, it's fun!
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour? <+++++> Are you serious?!
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it. <+++++> Wow! We are pretty good at this!
Yeah! <+++++> Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
I like it. <+++++> Are you kidding?
Hi! I 'm gal pal Rachel Green, and if you want the dirt, I'm the one you come too. This might be Joey's baby , who knows? I'm just kidding-Seriously,  gal pal Rachel Green. <+++++> Who just lost the respect of her unborn child.
Joey! You 're doing great! <+++++> Yeah, so far nothing stupid.
So, as Joey 's friends, is there anything that you guys think our readers ought to know? <+++++> Uh no, no just-just that he is a great guy.
Great! Well, it was nice meeting all of you. <+++++> Yeah, you too.
I 'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel... <+++++> Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel , yeah! About jellyfish and how if you...  Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
You can 't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So... <+++++> Ewwww!!
What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book! <+++++> Your make-up!
I think face to face. <+++++> I would say that.
Face to face, yeah! <+++++> Okay, here I go.
Oh my How much do you weigh Ross?! <+++++> I prefer not to answer that right now, I 'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
Great nap. <+++++> It really was.
And you know Monica and Ross! <+++++> Hi Jill.
Yeah! <+++++> Amazing! Amazing!
Little bit, yeah. <+++++> Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy.
Oh yeah, that 's just a little something for my huge gay fan base. <+++++> Did you just wink at me?
Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Why is he still crying? <+++++> Let me hold him for a sec. There.  Huh? There we are.
Maye it's me. <+++++> Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants.
You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody. <+++++> There we go. All better.
He hates me. My nephew hates me. <+++++> Come on, don't do this.
Are you ok, Ross? <+++++> I don't know. What's in this pie?
Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi-- <+++++> Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie.
No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special. <+++++> And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi.
No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god. <+++++> Ugh.
Oh my god. <+++++> Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.
Is your tongue swelling up? <+++++> Either that or my mouth is getting smaller.
Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot. <+++++> You know, you know, actually it's getting better. It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone for Thcrabble?
Jacket now. <+++++> What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.
We'll watch him. <+++++> I don't think tho.
I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window. <+++++> Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.
Hat, milk, got it. <+++++> ???  Thro up a thro thro--a thro thro!
No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play.  When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity.  Thank you! La la la la la la la.... <+++++> Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles. <+++++> Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now. <+++++> Tho?
Tho? <+++++> Ohhh.
That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me? <+++++> Ok.
No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here is the puncture wound from your ring. <+++++> Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate.
Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it! <+++++> I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand.
That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you. <+++++> Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?
Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle? <+++++> Oh.
Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin? <+++++> Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?
No. But I remember people telling me about it. <+++++> I hope Ben has a little sister.
Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass. <+++++> I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?
That was you? <+++++> They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it.
Yes! There's still pie. <+++++> I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?
Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today. <+++++> Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?
You, you are gonna love this. <+++++> Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here.
Hey. <+++++> Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK?
Only if you say his full name. <+++++> 
Together? <+++++> Uh huh.
Both of you? <+++++> Yep.
Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time. <+++++> Hopefully.
Ahhhh. <+++++> Oh. And how was the date?
I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember. <+++++> OK. Oh, oh, oh.
Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me? <+++++> No, I stayed at Julie's last night.
Huh. <+++++> Oh, actually I haven't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages?
Ohh, ohh. <+++++> When, when were you... under me? Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you, uh. . . What?
Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you. <+++++> You've had feelings for me?
Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first. <+++++> Woah. Huh. You know about my, I mean, you know I had... you know?
Chandler told me. <+++++> Chandler. When did he... when did he... when did he?
When you were in China. <+++++> China.
Meeting Julie. <+++++> Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing. OK so you uh, and now wha... and now, now, now you're over me?
Wait, so, you're going? <+++++> Well, OK, I uh, I have to. I can't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh, y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm... I'm gonna go get a cat.
OK, OK. <+++++> Cat.
Hi. <+++++> I didn't get a cat.
Oh, that's um, interesting. <+++++> No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.
Alright, I got it Ross. <+++++> You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie? <+++++> Then you should have said something before I met her.
I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me. <+++++> There was never a good time.
Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night. <+++++> Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.
Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point? <+++++> The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me? <+++++> Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross. <+++++> Fine.
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship. <+++++> Good.
Yeah. <+++++> Sure. Yeah.
Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom and dad this year? <+++++> Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20 th?
Yeah, I 'd really like to. <+++++> Okay, hopefully this time mom won 't boo you.
Hi! <+++++> Hey!
Yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35 th wedding anniversary, I had a star named after them. <+++++> Aww that is so cool.
Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt,  and I think my testacles may be in here too. <+++++> Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog! Y'know Monica couldn't get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.
What?! <+++++> You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!
Hey! <+++++> Hi!
Why don 't all of you tell me a little about your self? <+++++> Ah, actually, I 'm sorry we-we probably should get going.
Maaaassapequa, sounds like a magical place. Tell me about Massapequa, is it steep in Native American history? {Transcriber 's Note <+++++> Well, there is an Arby 's in the shape of a tee-pee.
Aces! <+++++> So uh, he seems like a nice guy.
Yeah, yeah I like him a lot. <+++++> Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?
Hi <+++++> Hi!  Hey mom.
Why would you serve food on such a sharp stick? <+++++> That 's a good question, dad. That's a good question
And also, congratulations on your wedding. <+++++> Wha -What?
Can we talk to you for just a y 'know It's just a little thing. Well we think it's absolutely marvelous that you're having this baby out of wedlock, some of our friends are less open-minded. Which is why we've told them all that you're married. <+++++> What?!
Thanks for going along with this. <+++++> Dad so what we have to pretend that we 're married?
Son, I had to shave my ears for tonight. You can do this. <+++++> Can you believe that?
Yeah, if you 're going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area. <+++++> No, us having to lie about being married.
Rachel! <+++++> Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan
Congratulations on the baby, and on the wedding <+++++> Hmmmm .
Unbelievable! <+++++> We love marriage!
Great! <+++++> Hey
I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don 't want him complimenting my thing. <+++++> I 'm so we weren't in the car! Did he ever let up?
He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle. <+++++> This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must take a mental picture!  Ooh sorry
Were you guys making fun of Parker? <+++++> That depends, how much did you hear?
I know <+++++> What was wrong with Mona?
Open it! Open it! Open it! <+++++> Yeah baby!
We were surprise that we weren 't invited. <+++++> No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.
So would I. You wouldn 't think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera. <+++++> Would you excuse us for a second?  Umm . what are you doing?
What? I 'm not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing. <+++++> Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley.
Oh yeah. That 's a great story. <+++++> Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium. That 's-that's where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower
Shhh! I want to hear the rest! <+++++> Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words  "Will you marry me?"
Ross, why don 't you give us your toast now? <+++++> Oh, no, Mom, it 's just Monica this year.
You 're not going to say anything? On our 35th wedding anniversary <+++++> No, of course, Um Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to say on behalf of my new bride, Rachel , and myself. Umm, that if if in 35 years, we're half as happy as you guys are, we'll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.
Ross, it just wouldn 't have been feasible. <+++++> But having a dove place the ring on your finger would 've been no problem?
It was really fun being married to you tonight. <+++++> Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I 've ever made.
Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something? <+++++> Yeah.
That proposal, at the planetarium <+++++> I know, I know it was stupid.
Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! It was really wonderful! Did you just make that up? <+++++> No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. It 's how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.
Well, that would 've been very hard to say no too. <+++++> It 's a good thing I didn't do it, because it sounds like it would've been a very expensive wedding.  Okay, good night
Goodnight <+++++> Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn 't get messed up?
I will think about it. <+++++> That 's all I'm askin'
Okay that 's it. I give up. At mom and dad's 40th anniversary, you're the one giving the speech. <+++++> Y 'know I don't understand why they didn't cry. It was a beautiful speech.
Oh, come on. <+++++> Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really would 've wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was.
Yeah. <+++++> Yeah, what, what was I thinking?
I see where you 're goin'! <+++++> What 's up with the greed Joe?
All right, look I 'm sorry you guys, but it's just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they're really expensive, y'know? I'm down to like three! Well, actually two 'cause one of 'em I kinda blackened in some teeth-Why did I do that?! <+++++> Well isn 't there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can't-can't you pick up, I don't know, an extra shift here?
Or, y 'know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you've got y'know a little of this  goin' on. Wow! I still have it! <+++++> Oh, wait! Wait! Don 't you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you'll get that job!
Hey! <+++++> Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today! <+++++> Wow!
Yeah! <+++++> After one class? I don 't think so.
What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there  and pretend you 're a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!! <+++++> Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that 's not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there's a concept you should really be familiar with. It's what the Japanese call  unagi.
Isn 't that a kind of sushi? <+++++> No, it 's a concept!
Yeah it is! It is! It 's freshwater eel! <+++++> All right, maybe it means that too
Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now! <+++++> Y 'know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don't even care!
Come on Ross. We 're sorry. Please tell us what it is. <+++++> Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish? <+++++> All I 'm saying is, it's one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don't know, like a  surprise!!
All I 'm saying is, it's one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don't know, like a  surprise!! <+++++> All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn 't mean you have unagi.
Ooh! Y 'know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour. <+++++> Y 'know what
No. <+++++> No.
Nothing! <+++++> So what are you gonna do?
What the hell was that?! <+++++> A lesson in the importance of unagi.
Ohh, you 're a freak!! <+++++> Perhaps. Now I 'm curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?
All right, so we weren 't pre pared! <+++++> I 'm sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I-look, I just want you guys to be safe.  DANGER!!!!!  Ahhh, huh? Unagi.
Hey. <+++++> Chandler. I sensed it was you.
What?! <+++++> Unagi. I 'm always aware.
Okay, are you aware unagi  is an eel? <+++++> What 's up?
I can 't figure out what to make Monica. <+++++> Oh, why don 't you make her one of your little jokes.
I 'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade? <+++++> Y 'know what? She'd-she'd love this.  Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon. <+++++> Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn 't actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
Wait a minute, I can 't give this to her. <+++++> Why not?
Because it says  "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom. <+++++> Oh.
Say we are unagi! <+++++> It 's not something you are! It's something you have!
Say it! <+++++> Y 'know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!
Okay ladies, that ends today 's class, and let's remember, let's be safe out there. <+++++> It 's a great class.
Thanks. <+++++> Yeah, yeah, I was watching.  Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what- what-what would you do next?
Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them <+++++> No. No-no. No. What would you do next?
Who? Me the attacker? <+++++> Yes that 's right.
Why? <+++++> I tired attacking two women, did not work.
What?! <+++++> No, I mean it 's okay, I mean, they're-they're my friends. In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?! <+++++> Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn 't. That's why I'm here. Maybe we could attack them together?  That-that's a no.
Why is Ross doing that? <+++++> DANGER!!!!
Hey. <+++++> Hey!
So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her? <+++++> Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.
You didn 't tell her did you? <+++++> No.
Of course not, because you 're in love with her. <+++++> I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn 't tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend.
What do you mean, comforted her? <+++++> It 's nothing, I just gave her a hug.
Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug! <+++++> It 's also a sign of friendship.
Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson. <+++++> It was a hug!
Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair? <+++++> S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?
Ninety percent of a women 's pheromones come out the top of her head! That's why, that's why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them!  Oh come on Ross, you're a scientist. <+++++> I was hugging her as a friend. It 's not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she's got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh coconutty.  What?! Oh, that doesn't mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!
Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel 's not in the same place you are. <+++++> If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
Wait, no, look at this!    "Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay " Oh, yeah, but it's on the ground floor. <+++++> Hey!
Hey. <+++++> Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?
Yeah! Why? <+++++> Okay, there 's this guy, Warren, from the museum and he's going on a dig for like two years and he's got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?
That sounds great! I 'd love to live at Warren's!! I love Warren! Thank you! <+++++> Don 't thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization.  Here's Warren's number.
Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now!  Oh, thank you! <+++++> Okay, you go grab it!
I saw it. <+++++> I don 't know what you're talking about.
Umm, I 'm talking about that which you already know but won't admit. You love her again; you re-love her! <+++++> Look, I do not re-love her.
I can 't believe you won't just admit it!  Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid. <+++++> Look, we 're just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?
Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I 'm never gonna find anything. <+++++> You can live with me.
What?! <+++++> What?
Oh my God! Are you serious?! <+++++> Uh-huh.
I would love to live with you Ross; that 's-that's great! Thank you! <+++++> Well, I 'm-I'm just glad I could, y'know, help you out.
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You 're my hero! <+++++> Hero, I uh, I don 't know-well, all right.
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has! <+++++> Oh please!   You 're gonna say things now, aren't ya?
Hey! <+++++> Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica 's and she and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in. <+++++> What do you mean, they 're not moving in? They-they're still moving in right?
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room. <+++++> What?! Over a stupid room!
Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I 'm also really psyched 'cause I don't have to move in here! <+++++> Oh no, yeah no, that part 's great!
Ross, we can handle this. <+++++> Well, apparently not, and I can 't just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!
Well, why don 't you tell her to stop being silly! <+++++> Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I 've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
I don 't know. <+++++> Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
Yeah, I do. <+++++> And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don 't ya?
Yes. <+++++> Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
I don 't know. <+++++> Hey Rach!
Hi! <+++++> You 're never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That's great news right-I mean for them. Right?
Oh wow. <+++++> Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
Yeah. Y 'know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don't you think it's gonna be weird? <+++++> Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?
Well, because of us! Because of our history. <+++++> No!
No? <+++++> No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?
No! Not at all! <+++++> Good! Me neither! So it 's not a problem. We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating. <+++++> Really?! We are?
Yeah! I 'm gonna have a boyfriend, you're gonna have a girlfriend <+++++> Ohh! That would be great.
But y 'know what, if you think it's gonna be okay we'll just work out a system. Y'know, it'll be like college, I'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, "Come back later, I'm gettin' lucky." <+++++> Yeah, I didn 't think of that.
He 's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness! <+++++> No, I-I-I 'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up!
Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room. <+++++> Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn 't about the room, this is about what the room represents! And unfortunately, this room  could destroy you!!
Yeah, no, me neither. <+++++> Fine! It 's your life!  I just don't want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together,  but that 's what you want, there's nothing I can do.  DON 'T DO IT!!!!!
Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer. <+++++> So umm, where are the other guys?
Umm, well let 's see Monica and Chandler are occupied. <+++++> Fighting?!
No, the other thing. I really think it 's great they work things out. <+++++> Yeah. There 's no breaking them up, is there?
Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy? <+++++> Sure! Here.
Thank you.  Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there 's no turning back. <+++++> Yeah, I 'm-I'm sure.  Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind.
Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea? <+++++> I 've been back and forth.
Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you 're right where you don't want to be! Back together! <+++++> Ehh, I don 't, I don't think so. She's already talked about y'know, dating other guys.
That 's not gonna work out! Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, "Oh that's okay. You'll find someone." And then, bamn! She finds you! <+++++> Yeah, well, m-maybe you 're right.
I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want? <+++++> Is that what I want?
Or not. Uh, Rach, why don 't you just move in with me? <+++++> Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
I can 't believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York. <+++++> No, it 's really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.
No, it 's really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe. <+++++> Help! Help!! Help! Help!!
How are ya man? <+++++> Oh hey, that was a good one, huh?  Help! Help!
Oh, Liam. <+++++> Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something -or should I call it  football?
Ross play rugby? I don 't think so. <+++++> What 's ah, what's so funny about that?
Well I mean, you 're American to start with. You don't even have rugby here. <+++++> Well, we didn 't have freedom here until 1776, either so
Cheers! <+++++> Cheers!
Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining. <+++++> Oh, just hold on a second. I 'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don 't know what the big deal is. I'm man enough to play this sport.
Hey there Ross! <+++++> Hey!
Nope.  Man look at this! Ross, I can 't believe you said you'd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is! <+++++> Hey, I can handle it! All right?
Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad. <+++++> That 's 'cause-'cause you're mom's dog kept-kept looking at me.
Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That 's called a scrum, okay? It's kinda like a huddle. <+++++> And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?
Well, why are you doing this anyway? <+++++> Well, you should 've seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he's like Joe Rugby.
You 're kidding! And he plays rugby?! That's so funny.  Ohh! I see how you did that. All right. <+++++> Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I 'm gonna show her how tough I really am!
Thanks! <+++++> Look, don 't worry about me. Okay? I'll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I'll uh, I'll be that guy right out of the circle.
Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that one -Dude! They're all huge! <+++++> They don 't look any bigger than me!
I 'm just going to say hi to the lads. All right? <+++++> All right.
Whoa!  I kinda liked it. <+++++> Okay, I know what I have to do. I 've got to go Red Ross.  Y'know, Red Ross!
I totally don 't know what you're talking about. <+++++> Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!
No. <+++++> You 'll see.
Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in! <+++++> JOEY!!!!!!
That 's just halftime, there's more of this. <+++++> Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!
Right. <+++++> Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water?
Okay. <+++++> Thanks.  I-I think I'm dying. I really do.
Oh, poor baby. <+++++> Tell my son that I love him.  Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!
Ross, they are killing you out there! <+++++> That's not true!
She 's right! You have to stop! <+++++> What? No! No, I 'm not stopping. I'm Red Ross!
Dude, if you go back out there, you 're gonna be Dead Ross! <+++++> I don 't care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you. <+++++> No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
No. That 's not what I'm saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain. <+++++> I like that.
Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle. <+++++> Huh?
One swift kick and he 'll back off. <+++++> All right, bad ankle, got it!
And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn 't wear a cup. <+++++> Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!
And uh, Liam, Liam 's got bad knees. You hit him right and he'll go down like a lamp. <+++++> But-but, Liam 's on my team.
I don 't care! You just get him! <+++++> I 'm gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!
Now, are you sure you don 't want to go see a doctor? <+++++> Oh no! That-that 'll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y'know what? I'm buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it's in my pocket.
Yeah, sure. <+++++> No, not you.
You were amazing out there. <+++++> Oh, I kinda was, wasn 't I?
Oh my God! <+++++> I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven 't done that since I was four and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.
You really enjoyed yourself didn 't you? <+++++> Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose -I mean I-I'm not proud of it but, I really am. And it's all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
I think you 've got concussion. <+++++> No, no, I 'm serious. Thank you.
You 're welcome.  I'm sorry. Did I hurt you? <+++++> It 's worth the pain.  Y'know what, you know what? It's not.
Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned. <+++++> Awww.
Okay, I 'll see you in our room. <+++++> Yeah.
Oh my God. <+++++> I know.
I know. <+++++> Okay, I gotta go.
Whoa! What?! Why?! <+++++> Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
Here?! Now?! <+++++> Well, yeah. I can 't-I can't stay here all night, and if I go in there she's-she's gonna wanna... do stuff.
Well, can 't you tell her that you are not in the mood? <+++++> No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn 't work either, I can't tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...
Whoa-ho. <+++++> Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?
I don 't know. <+++++> Yeah, yeah.  It wasn 't every morning.
Oh, making it worse! <+++++> Okay.
Oh, was it awful? <+++++> Well, it was loong. I didn 't even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o'clock shadow on her head.  Anyway, she didn't want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.
I wrote you a letter. <+++++> Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
It 's just some things I've been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff. <+++++> Okay.  Wow, it 's-it's 5
Well, I 'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done. <+++++> Okay, I 'll be up in,  18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
Hey!  What happened to you? Why didn 't you come up? <+++++> Done!
You just finished? <+++++> Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
So umm, does it? <+++++> I 'm sorry.
Does it? <+++++> Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole  'Does it?' part just another glance.
What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn 't, and if you have to even think about it... <+++++> No, Rach, no. I don 't, I don't, I don't have to think about it, in fact, I 've decided, I've decided that, that it.......does.
Are you sure? <+++++> Oh, sure! I 'm sure.
Well, I 'm ready to get the hell out of here!  Oh. Are you? Are you?!!  Ohh! That's so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie.  But for you, yay! Ohh. <+++++> Hey!
Nothing, I don 't know. <+++++> What happened?
Ooh, I have to go pack.  It really does? <+++++> It does. It really and truly does.
It does. It really and truly does. <+++++> It so does not!!!
Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I 'm gonna break up with you! <+++++> Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,   "If you accept full responsibility..."  Full responsibility! "...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do.  Does it?!!"
Look, Ross, you have what you want, you 're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you. <+++++> Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you 're right. Yeah I guess I'll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
Sure, it 's hard to forget! But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about. <+++++> What the hell happened on that beach?!
I 'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us. <+++++> Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me. <+++++> Come on!
Come on! <+++++> What happened? Joey?
I 'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel... <+++++> Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel , yeah! About jellyfish and how if you...  Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
You can 't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So... <+++++> Ewwww!!
Oh-hooo, I missed you. <+++++> I missed you too.
Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you 've grown. Y'know? <+++++> I suppose.
You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all,  "Once a cheater, always a cheater." <+++++> Umm-hmm.
Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!! <+++++> I didn 't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn't finish the whole letter!
What?!! <+++++> I fell asleep!
You fell asleep?! <+++++> It was 5
Y'know I can 't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!! <+++++> FINE BY ME!!
Sorry!!  I just feel bad about all that sleep you 're gonna miss wishing you were with me! <+++++> Oh, no-no-no don 't you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!
Oh, I-I'm just making a list of people's birthdays. <+++++> Oh, mine's December...
I could die. <+++++> Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
Wish me luck. <+++++> Good luck!
My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey. <+++++> Way to go, Phoebe!
Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters. <+++++> Ooh, that's great, I love those little guys.
Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy. <+++++> Come on, Pheebs lay off him.
Thank you, Ross. <+++++> Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love.
All right. <+++++> Ohh!
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that "Woo-hoo" thing. <+++++> Hey!
Hey. <+++++> So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!
Rachel's not here. <+++++> Oh.
How's it going with her? <+++++> Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little  "playing" ourselves.
I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum. <+++++> Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.
Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom? <+++++> Oh!
What was that? <+++++> Monica knows.
It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother. <+++++> Well, I'm gonna go get ready,  for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just head.
Hi! <+++++> Hi!
Hi Ben! <+++++> Wow! You-you look great!
Thanks! <+++++> Okay!  Hey Tommy.
I am so glad that you could come over tonight. <+++++> Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure.
Okay, well, my cell phone number is right here on the counter, please help yourself to anything in the fridge. <+++++> What?
I appreciate this soo much, I've been trying to go out with this guy for like a month. <+++++> I-I-I...
Oh, I don't mean to be a square, but I'd really appreciate it if you wait and drink your wine after the kids are asleep? Oh uh, thanks for this, I hope I can do the same for you sometime. <+++++> Who wants to make some long distance calls?
Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was. <+++++> Her date tipped me ten dollars.
Her date tipped me ten dollars. <+++++> Pheebs, what are you doing?
What?! <+++++> Are you serious?
Ross, cough drops, please? <+++++> At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian. <+++++> You see Amanda and I have a very special...
That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops! <+++++> Fine.
Sorry. <+++++> Here.   At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.
I don 't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black. <+++++> What?
 <+++++> Uh actually Joey, it 's the Cretasous period.
Hey!! <+++++> Hey!
Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married! <+++++> Oh my God!!
And! And, they 're gonna have a baby!  And! And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus. <+++++> My God!
I know! <+++++> Pheebs, you 're talking about putting your body through an awful lot, I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it's all for somebody else!
Yeah, what 's your point? <+++++> Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we 'll be supportive like crazy. <+++++> Yeah.
Oh, Chandler that is so nice. <+++++> That is really nice lying! No way is that the reason!
Well, Kathy 's last boyfriend was Joey. <+++++> And you 're afraid you won't be able to fill his shoes.
No, I 'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him. <+++++> Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
Yeah! <+++++> Just go for it Chandler.
I-I think everybody 's pretending they don't hear you. Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it!  Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I saved you seat. <+++++> That 's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey.
It 's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right? <+++++> But hey, it 's not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.
Whatever. <+++++> It 's like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
Dr. Geller, there 's a seat over here. <+++++> Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I 'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.
I will sit with you Dr. Geller. <+++++> Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y 'know what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath.  I'm Ross! I'm divorced, and I have a kid!
I 'm Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me. <+++++> All right, there you go!
I 'm Andrew, and I didn't pay for this pear. <+++++> Okay, good-good for you.
I 'm Rhonda,  and these aren't real! <+++++> Wow, Rhonda.
I 'm Scott. <+++++> Yeah, okay, Scott!
Hi. <+++++> Hi!
From the land down under? I didn't know that either! <+++++> So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?
"When can you move in?" <+++++> Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated. <+++++> Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.
You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man. <+++++> Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth. <+++++> Yeah.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning! <+++++> Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back. <+++++> Put it back exactly where you found it?
Yes I'm gonna put it back  exactly where I found it. <+++++> 'Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.
She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place. <+++++> Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?
She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it. <+++++> Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out. <+++++> Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.
It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon!  She's-she's gonna kill me. <+++++> Yeah, the phone was facing the other way.  And that goes back up there.
We should start with the big stuff. Y 'know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch.  I got it. <+++++> Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table. <+++++> Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.
OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch. <+++++> Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame!  What the hell's going on over here?!?!?  Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time. <+++++> Hey, I've been married 3 times
No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret? <+++++> Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine? <+++++> Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go  "ba dum bum chessh"
Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that. <+++++> Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
This is great, this is great, what else, what else? <+++++> Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.
And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny. <+++++> They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica. <+++++> I'm never gonna find love again.
Okay, is this lamp in the same place? <+++++> Who cares? I repel women.
What?! <+++++> What?!
I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked. <+++++> Why does anyone have to be naked?
Why is Ross naked? <+++++> I-I had to show Chandler something?
Naked? <+++++> Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.
Bye! Thank God <+++++> Dude, what'd you have?
Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place. <+++++> The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
That's perfect! That's brilliant! <+++++> So really, what'd ya have?
Why is everything different? <+++++> Bye!
...and live forever as a machine! <+++++> That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing.
Well, he 's not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with him-He says it's okay.  Great! Thanks! Bye-bye! <+++++> Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn 't free?
Oh I do!  Oh, y 'know what? No.  Wait a second.  I know it's in here somewhere. <+++++> Y 'know what? I'm good! I'm good!
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can 't work if I'm sick. <+++++> Ohh!
I don 't need a tissue! I'm fine-d! <+++++> When you put a  'D' at the end of 'Fine' you're not fine.
And you know Monica and Ross! <+++++> Hi Jill.
I just had the hardest day. Those bags are so heavy. <+++++> Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.
Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got!  This is my "Please, hire me" sweater.  And these are my, "Don't you want to rent me this apartment?" pants. <+++++> I don 't think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
No! They did! <+++++> Yeah, we went shopping!
Sorry Jill. <+++++> Sorry-sorry Jill.
No, of course, of course I 've heard of them! Ross, what did you get? <+++++> Huh? Oh, I got this --this!
A pajmena? <+++++> Yeah! Oh, I-I love this babies!
Really? <+++++> Ross, wants a pajmena?
Ross, wants a pajmena? <+++++> It 's a rug.
She took all my stuff. <+++++> Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one.
That 's the best one! Oh my God,  thank you so much! <+++++> Well. Hey
Oh my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pajmena could be a rug! <+++++> Oh yeah, how about you and the,   "I'm sorry!"
Were you this cute in high school? <+++++> Oh stop.
No you stop! <+++++> No, you stop!
Damnit! <+++++> Rach? Hi!
Hi! <+++++> Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
Well yeah <+++++> Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, I-I-I think she 's cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!
Really?! <+++++> Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured,  "Why not?!"
Oh so-so not really never. <+++++> I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we 've been through, I just-y'know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
Me too. <+++++> Hi Jill!
Hey! <+++++> Hi .
Rachel. <+++++> Rachel! Well, you-you 're not at home, you're-you're-you're right here.
Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it 's not! <+++++> Okay. So well I 'll umm,  I'll have her home by midnight.
So it was really cool seeing you lecture today. <+++++> Oh thanks. Although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there a little.
Oh no-no, I-I had my eyes closed so I could concentrate and y 'know take it all in. <+++++> Yeah, a lot of my students do that.
So, I gotta get going. <+++++> Okay, I-I 'll see you tonight.
Yeah. <+++++> Okay, bye.
So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. How 's it going? <+++++> Ah, it 's good. It's going good. I mean, we get along great. She's, she's so
Hot? <+++++> Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!
She 's okay with Rachel and the baby? <+++++> Well I I haven't actually told her yet. I don't want to scare her off, y'know?
So don 't think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as a a two month anniversary present. <+++++> Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance!
Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough. <+++++> Uh actually, sorry I can 't even make it. I'm seeing Mona again tonight.
I love your place! Where is this guy from? <+++++> Uh that 's an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.
Oh wow! So, you 're more than just dinosaurs. <+++++> So much more.
Oh my God! Oh my God! I 'm so sorry! <+++++> Aw forget it, it 's from Pier One.  Sorry.
You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! I 'm gonna kill you!! <+++++> Y 'know this is actually not a great time for me.
You got Rachel pregnant?! <+++++> Who did?!
You did! <+++++> Yes. Yes, yes I did.  But-but it was, it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing.
Oh? Really? That 's what my daughter means to you? Nothing? <+++++> No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care -I-I love Rachel.
What?! <+++++> Oh but not that way. I mean I mean I'm not in love with her. I love her like a, like a friend.
Oh really? That 's how treat a friend? You get her in trouble and then refuse to marry her? <+++++> Hey! I offered to marry her!
Wh <+++++> But I didn 't want to.
Tramp?! <+++++> I 'm sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.
How could you have kept all of this from me? <+++++> I was going to tell you, but
But what?! You figured you 'd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel! <+++++> Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I just  Why don't we just let the machine get that?
Hey Ross. It 's Joey. There's a hooker over here and we thought maybe you'd know something about it. <+++++> No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I -I need to, I need to lie down.
Ross I 'm so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail. <+++++> I don 't care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she's totally freaked out!
Oh okay, I 'll fix that to. What's her e-mail address? <+++++> Rachel!
All right, I promise. I 'll fix this. I swear. I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll talk to her. <+++++> Okay!
Okay. <+++++> Thank you!
I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, I 'm so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. You're gonna have to tell me how you did that. <+++++> Focus.
Oh we just -we drove each other crazy! <+++++> Yeah.
I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go! <+++++> Trying to date this woman.
Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is. <+++++> Probably shouldn 't touch me.
I know, I get it, but Mona, what relationship is not complicated? I mean we all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single?  I am so gonna leave right now. <+++++> Should I leave this open for you too?
I 'm not sure yet. Why didn't you just tell me about all this? <+++++> Because what 's going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you.
Yeah? Well you still shoulda told me. <+++++> I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel 's father. Look I I made a mistake, but it's only because I really, really like you. Really!
Oh no, I can 't go. I'm practicing; I got an audition to be the host of a new game show. <+++++> Oh cool!
But the audition 's in a couple hours and I don't even understand the game. <+++++> Well do you want some help?
Oh really? That 'd be great! You guys can be the contestants! <+++++> Awesome!
Yeah, isn 't that a cool name? <+++++> Yeah!
All right. Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why don 't you tell us a little something about you Ross? <+++++> Well uh, I-I 'm a paleontologist. Umm, I-I live in New York. I have a son Ben. Uh, hi Ben!  And uh
Can you believe how lame this is? <+++++> I 'm sorry, I don't believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.
All right Ross you 're in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem? <+++++> The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh, I 'll take another question.
Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath. <+++++> It 's okay, I'm ready.
Triscadecaphobia. <+++++> The fear of Triscuts!
Fear of Triscuts? <+++++> It 's possible, they have really sharp edges.
All right Chandler, you 're up. <+++++> Wait a minute, I-I believe I 'm entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?
This game makes no sense! <+++++> Y 'know what? You're just upset because you're losing.
Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross 's points! <+++++> What?!
This game is kinda fun. <+++++> You don 't think it's a little crazy that you get all my points just 'cause you
Hungry monkey. <+++++> Hungry monkey!  Haaa!  I 'd like a Wicked Wango card!
Okay, it 's an audio question, name this television theme song. <+++++> Oh.  Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me- give me a second!

Correct again! But, you forgot to switch legs between questions, so no hopping bonus! <+++++> Noooo!!! Every time!!!
Nooo!! <+++++> Yeah!!
It is going to be okay!  It was worth a shot. <+++++> Hey!
Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty? <+++++> I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
Not if you were here. <+++++> Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all. <+++++> A Play-Dough Barber Shop?
No. She 's going to live with us for eight weeks. <+++++> Uh, what?
Yes! She 's gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo. <+++++> What -You're not serious. I mean she's a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. She'll drive us totally crazy.
Hi Ross! <+++++> Hi roomie!
and all those dinosaur nick-knacks you have Ross, I thought they might be more at home in the garage. <+++++> Well we we don't have a garage.
Did I say garage? I meant garbage. <+++++> Y 'know what? Maybe, Mrs. Green, it's not absolutely vital that you live with us.
I do. I really do. I don 't know anything. <+++++> I 'm-I'm sure that's not true.
It 's frightening. <+++++> Well uh, y 'know what? Even if she doesn't know anything, I do! I have a son. And his mother and I didn't live together, and whenever he was with me I took care of him all the time, by myself.
That 's true. You do have another child. <+++++> Yeah.
With another woman. Have you no control Ross? <+++++> That 's a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes I will be there to to feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want to do all those things.
Well then you really don 't need me to live with you. <+++++> Yes! Yes, you 're gonna be so missed.
You 're gonna be a great father. <+++++> Well you 're gonna be a wonderful grandma.
Hello?! I still don 't know what the hell I'm doing! <+++++> Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way. You 'll-you're gonna pick it up.  Hey! You will! Uh look, y'know when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddy's credit card. Do you remember?
I hope you 're going somewhere with this. <+++++> Look at you! What -You're-you're this big executive! You are much more capable than you give yourself credit for. I-I have no doubt you're gonna be an incredible mother.
Really? <+++++> I 'm telling you.
All right you two, I 'm gonna get going. <+++++> Oh.
Okay! I 'm ready. <+++++> You sure?
Yes, I 've done my studying and I really know my stuff. <+++++> All right then.  Rachel Green! Let's play Bamboozled!  How do you test the temperature of the baby's bath water?
Uh, put your elbow in it. <+++++> Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?
Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers. <+++++> That 's correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when the baby makes this sound?
Check if it 's wet, check if it's hungry, burp it! <+++++> Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card?
A card! A card! I pick a card! <+++++> Oh, I 'm sorry you've been Bamboozled! You're gonna be a terrible mother!  I've lost sight of why we're doing this!
Huh? So whaddya think? Casa de Joey. Huh? I decorated it myself. <+++++> Get out.
Art it is. <+++++> 
Hey, how come, uhh, Chandler didn't come? <+++++> Well uh, it's cause he had a thing with, wi-, with the thing.
No no no, behind it. <+++++> Wha-, you have a phone in here?
Oh God. Ross, OK, if you care about me at all, you will get the pie out of the man's hood. <+++++> Get the what?
What're you doing? <+++++> I'm sorry, my pie was, was in your hood. Now I just have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants and I'll be back in the hospital by 7.
Damnit Ross, get your butt out of the bathroom. <+++++> Calm down, I'm blow drying.
Or ya know, he's rubber and you're glue. <+++++> 
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain. <+++++> 
Shut up. <+++++> 
Cut it out. <+++++> 
But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together. <+++++> Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated.
But... <+++++> No. You're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now, OK, you're not... rommmates anymore.
I was. <+++++> Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line.
Did she leave a number? <+++++> Did you see me write one down?
I don't have her number, butt-munch. <+++++> Well, she'll call back, don't be such a baby.
I'm not a baby, you're the baby. <+++++> Look, you wanna get off my back?
You wanna get out of my face? <+++++> Wait hold on Tony, hold on.
Give me that. <+++++> OK.
I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy? <+++++> Uh, Eddie something. He just met him.
Oh my God. <+++++> I know.
I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight. <+++++> Tough noogies, we're watching Predators of the Serengetti.
It's my TV. <+++++> Wha-, oh, quit it.
Oh my God. <+++++> Well, Monica keeps changin' the channel.
OK, what're we gonna do about this? <+++++> Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight.
Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here. <+++++> Ow, ow, OK. Alright, alright, Mon, Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, alright.
I just can't stand you being here all the time. <+++++> Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're just havin' fun.
Fun? Fun, you think this is fun? <+++++> Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids.
Ross, I hated you when we were kids. <+++++> You hated me when we were kids?
Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts. <+++++> Why did you hate me?
Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way. <+++++> And that wasn't fun for you?
Duh-huh! <+++++> I can't believe you hated me.
Now I love you. And not just 'cause I have to. <+++++> Really?
Yeah. You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off. <+++++> I can do that.
Then I won't have to kill you. <+++++> So you wanna watch uh, Entertainment Tonight?
Yeah, thanks. You know what? <+++++> What?
If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can. <+++++> Ohh... OK.
Hey. <+++++> Hey.
Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video. <+++++> No.
I mean this poor woman. <+++++> What woman?
You or me? <+++++> I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
You guys are messin' with me, right? <+++++> Yeah.
Maureen Rosilla. <+++++> Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.
Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky. <+++++> We'll give you Janice.
Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution? <+++++> Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?
Nah. Not really. <+++++> You don't believe in evolution?
I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy. <+++++> Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?
Yeah, I just don't buy it. <+++++> Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.
Ok, don't get me started on gravity. <+++++> You uh, you don't believe in gravity?
Check this out. Can I have this? <+++++> How can you not believe in evolution?
Just don't. Look at this funky shirt! <+++++> Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.
Really? You can actually see it? <+++++> You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.
See, I didn't know that. <+++++> Well, there you go.
Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp. <+++++> Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?
Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts. <+++++> Please tell me you're joking.
Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't. <+++++> No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--
What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope. <+++++> Is there blood coming out of my ears?
Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend? <+++++> You remember Janice, right?
Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man. <+++++> Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.
Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities. <+++++> It's the only possibility, Phoebe.
Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this? <+++++> There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.
I can't believe you caved. <+++++> What?
Oh, yeah. <+++++> You comin'?
I gotta get one, too. <+++++> What are you guys doing?
We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle? <+++++> Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.
Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it. <+++++> This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.
This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on. <+++++> Carol?
Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one? <+++++> No thanks.
Great. <+++++> Hi, honey.
Hey, sweetums. <+++++> Hello to the rest.
Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street. <+++++> So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?
Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal. <+++++> It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.
Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep. <+++++> Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
Oh, I got that for him. <+++++> My mommies love me. That's clever.
Ben, dinner! <+++++> Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.
I licked my arm, what? <+++++> It's breast milk.
What did you just do? <+++++> Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?
You won't even taste it? <+++++> No!
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk? <+++++> Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out. <+++++> I did not freak out.
Why'd you freak out? <+++++> Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
This should be fun. <+++++> No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it. <+++++> That would be no.
Exactly. <+++++> You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
Uh huh. <+++++> Oh, you've tasted it.
You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true. <+++++> Gimme the bottle.  Gimme the towel.
Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo. <+++++> A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that?
Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool? <+++++> No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?
No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything. <+++++> I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'
OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up. <+++++> Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it.
Oh thank you. <+++++> Hi ma.
Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride? <+++++> Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.
C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously. <+++++> Dad, you really don't want to do that.
Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. . . <+++++> Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.
Almost time for cake. <+++++> Mon, Mon, are you OK?
You remember that video I found of mom and dad? <+++++> Yeah.
Well, I just caught the live show. <+++++> Eww.
Oh? <+++++> Ohh.
She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone? <+++++> Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?
Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world. <+++++> Lemme see.
Well? <+++++> Well it's really. . . sexy. I wouldn't have thought it would be but. . . wow.
Really? <+++++> Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?
I guess. <+++++> Hey, save us some pizza.
Well that 's no way to sell newspapers. Why don't you try, "Extra! Extra! Read all about it!" <+++++> No, Monica 's restaurant got a horrible review in the Post.  I didn't want her to see it, so I ran around the neighborhood and bought all the copies I could find.
Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers! It must be a good review! Is it great?! <+++++> Umm
Oh dear God! <+++++> But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.
What about the rest of Manhattan?! <+++++> Yeah, they all know.
Is he right? Am I really -Am I awful? <+++++> No!
Ross! <+++++> What?! What?
I am freaking out! <+++++> Are ya?
My due date is in one week! <+++++> What are you doing up?
That is seven days! <+++++> Okay look, I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do this after
No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please, come on we do not have any of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not have a diaper service! <+++++> It 's funny you should mention diapers.
I 'm serious. <+++++> Okay look, there 's nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time. There's a great baby furniture store on west 10th. Tomorrow, we will go there and we will get you everything that you need. Okay?
Okay. Thank you. That 's great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west 10th? Because there's this really cute shoe store that has like this little <+++++> Okay. Okay. If uh, if you 're gonna do this, then I'm gonna do that.  So
Oh, wait Ross! I 'm sorry, one more thing! <+++++> Yeah!
Umm, our situation. Y 'know umm, what we mean to each other. And I mean we-we're having this baby together, and we live together. Isn't that, isn't that weird? <+++++> Well uh
Oh. <+++++> Oh.
No-no-no! No, no, no, we 're not married. <+++++> We are having a baby together, but we 're not involved.  I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while ago, but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night.  Or, yes stranger, we'd like this delivered please.
Why don 't you fill out this address card. <+++++> Oh, okay.
Oh yeah! Actually, that 's one of the reasons why we're not a couple. <+++++> I chose those, I 'm a paleontologist.
Oh no-no, I 'm fascinated by paleontology. Have you read the new Walter Alvarez book? <+++++> Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.
Oh, I love your neighborhood. There 's a great gym right around the corner from your building. <+++++> That 's my gym.
I can tell you work out.  A paleontologist who works out, you 're like Indiana Jones. <+++++> I am like Indiana Jones.
All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life? <+++++> My son? Pretty serious.  Oh hey Katie!  What uh, what are you doing here?
Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this. <+++++> Ah, must 've been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.
Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job description. <+++++> Oh.
Oh uh I actually came here to ask you out. <+++++> Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. I 'm just gonna put this  back in my pocket, pretend that didn 't happen. Uh yeah, actually I'm free now. Do you wanna grab some coffee or
So you guys go, have a really good time. <+++++> Yeah, I 'm just gonna grab my coat. And uh, and my whip.  Y'know because of the Indiana Jones?  Not-not because I'm-I'm into S&M.  I'm not-I'm not into anything weird. Y'know? Just-just normal sex.  So, I'm gonna grab my coat.
Hi! You 're back from your date! <+++++> How are you?
I 'm fine, but that's not important. What's important is how was she? <+++++> Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee.
Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table. <+++++> What 's uh, what's going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?
No! No, she 's-She was nice. I mean, she's a little slutty, but who isn't? <+++++> I liked her.
Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones! <+++++> Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!
No! It 's just that, Kate bothered me. <+++++> Why? What was wrong with her?
There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely! <+++++> Okay, so what 's the matter?
I don 't want you to date her! <+++++> Why? What, what are you jealous?
Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I don 't want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it's a terrible thing to even think this, and it's completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day! I'm very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel. <+++++> Okay.
What?! <+++++> I won 't date. I'll uh, I'll be here, with you, all the time.
Really? But I 'm being so unreasonable. <+++++> True, but you 're allowed to be unreasonable. You're having our baby.
Oh Ross, thank you. Thank you. <+++++> Do you feel better?
No, not really. You 're pressing the baby into my bladder and now I have to pee. Sorry. <+++++> Uh Rach?
Yeah. <+++++> Just one thing umm
Uh-huh. <+++++> We live together. You 're having our baby. I'm not gonna see anybody else. Are you-are you sure you don't want something more?
Wow! I don 't know, maybe. I'm <+++++> Oh-oh, Rach! I was just messin ' around!  Like you did last night when I had to pee?
I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin ' with you too! <+++++> Okay. Okay. Because for a minute you said you
Oh no-no-no-no, no! <+++++> that you actually
No that 's just--That's just 'cause I'm such a good messer! <+++++> Rach?
Yeah? <+++++> The bathroom?
Hello. <+++++> Will!
Ross! <+++++> Hey-hey you came! Man you look incredible! Hot stuff!  Hot stuff?
It 's good to see you man. <+++++> Yeah, you too. Man, so-so what are you up to?
I 'm a commodities broker. <+++++> Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting.
Yeah, it 's not. But I'm rich and thin. <+++++> Oh! Man I don 't think I've seen you since uh, Lance Davis' graduation party.
That was such a fun night! <+++++> Yeah. It would 've been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.
Yeah. <+++++> Yeah.
God we were lame back then. Do you remember how into dinosaurs we were? <+++++> Yeah.
So what do you, what do you do now? <+++++> So how long are you in town?
Rachel Green. <+++++> Aw -oh, that's right. Are-are you gonna be okay?
Oh, I 'll-I'll be fine. Just God I hate her Ross! I hate her! <+++++> Will, high school was-was a long time ago.
Me and Ross. <+++++> No need to point, she knows who Ross is.
Yes he was. <+++++> No. No.
So who else was in this club? <+++++> Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but I-I don 't think he-he knew what it was.
You went out with her?! We had a pact! <+++++> That was in high school! It 's not like it was binding forever.
I swear I didn 't.  Hey! Is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door? <+++++> Yeah.
Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say. <+++++> Look Rach I-I 'm sorry, okay? I I was a stupid kid, okay? The only reason I joined
Co-founded! <+++++> co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love with you. Obviously I didn't handle it very well. But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.
Well, we did a little more than that. <+++++> No-no! No-no. No-no.
Ross! <+++++> It was no big deal. We-we said that the rumor was that umm you had both male and female reproductive parts.
Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This is why Adam Carter wouldn 't go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region! <+++++> Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one 's not really our fault.
Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year,  "Dear Rach, you're such a good person." Not girl! Person! <+++++> Rach, I think you 're reading a little too much into it.
"Dear Rach, you're a great person. Sorry about your tiney-wienie." <+++++> Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasn 't true?!
Oh! Me too! <+++++> Well look-look I 'm not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million years ago!
What? <+++++> What?
Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman, our 50-year-old librarian. <+++++> How did you know that?!!!!
It 's true?!! <+++++> No.
I 'm sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman? <+++++> Hey! She didn 't look 50!
Oh!  Wow! <+++++> She didn 't photograph well!
So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner? <+++++> I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of us. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must know, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace
Didn 't she walk with a cane? <+++++> Only when it was damp!!  I can 't believe you-you told people about this?! Everybody knew?! Y'know what?  I'm back in the club!
And Ross, if it weren 't for Rachel's rumor I mean no one in high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map! <+++++> As a romancer of the elderly.
Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty. <+++++> The eyes did still sparkle.
She 's right. <+++++> Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together.
Hold on! You got her pregnant? <+++++> Yeah.
Are ya getting married? <+++++> Nope.
I didn 't know Playboy prints jokes. <+++++> Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It 's not just about the pictures.
That didn 't work on mom, it's not going to work on us. <+++++> Here, check it out. It 's the first one, too.
That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up. <+++++> What?
I made that joke up. <+++++> Uh, oh-oh, no you didn 't. I did.
Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he 'd ever heard. <+++++> Hey, tell Dan,  'Thanks.'
Hey, tell Dan,  'Thanks.' <+++++> What?
Well, you tell a lot of jokes! <+++++> Look, Chandler, it 's my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don't print the name, so it doesn't really matter who gets credit, right?
Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke. <+++++> No, it 's my joke, it's mine. You can call them, they'll tell you.
It 's my joke. <+++++> It 's my joke.
Yeah. <+++++> You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I 'm not even sure I got it. <+++++> What, you didn 't get it? The doctor is a monkey.
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke. <+++++> Your joke? Well, I think  'the Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money. <+++++> Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I 'll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.
Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke. <+++++> Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
Yeah! <+++++> Well, I 'm not going to go now anyway .
Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink,  'cause I'm heading up there. <+++++> Uh, yeah, I 'll take a coffee. Thanks, man.
Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine. <+++++> Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?
Okay, I guess it doesn 't seem that weird. <+++++> Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven 't gotten it.
Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y 'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover. <+++++> Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
It 's my joke. <+++++> It's my joke.
It's my joke. <+++++> Y 'know, I don't think we're going to settle this.
Let 's have Monica decide. <+++++> Yeah!
Yeah! <+++++> Hey Mon.
Mon, get out here! <+++++> Monica!
Because you 're the only one that can be fair. <+++++> Yeah.
I can 't be fair. You're my boyfriend. <+++++> Yeah, but I 'm your brother. We're family. That's the most important thing in the world.
Don 't try to sway her.   I'm your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let's go. <+++++> We 'll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth-me.
Do you want me to pick you?! <+++++> See, I would never snap at you like that.
So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve 's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, 'Doctor Monkey?' And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. <+++++> Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I 'm a doctor, and I had a monkey. I'm Doctor Monkey!
You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it 's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks! <+++++> It 's your joke.
Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick? <+++++> No way.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we 'd do nothing. <+++++> Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
I don 't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist. <+++++> I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
Okay fine, now Ross <+++++> Oh, but-but I can 't do it.
I 've got Ben. <+++++> Because, because I 've got Ben.
Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment! <+++++> Of course he is! What, do you think I 'd just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
All right, sorry. <+++++> I gotta go make a fake Ben.
What 's up? <+++++> Oh, I 'm just over here with Ben. I thought we'd say hi.
Oh, put him on! <+++++> Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica.  Oh, I guess he doesn 't feel like talking right now. He's smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money. <+++++> And now you want that money back.
Exactly. <+++++> Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
It 's not a real game! I made it up! <+++++> I 'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
At a fake game!! <+++++> Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I 'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.
Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last. <+++++> No.
Hey! <+++++> I 'm sorry I'm late, did I miss anything?
Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth. <+++++> 15?  Your personal best!
Where were you? <+++++> Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.
No, answer his. <+++++> Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she 'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.
Were you so late because you were burring this woman? <+++++> No, I 'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
Oh yeah! With who? <+++++> You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
Yeah. <+++++> Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can 't decide between the two of them. Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's not fun.
If she 's no fun, why do you want to date her at all? <+++++> Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y 'know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was-if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Bad dream? <+++++> I wasn 't sleeping.
Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe 's song about? <+++++> The one with the cat. I gotta go, I 've got another date.
So, did you pick one yet? <+++++> No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought -it wasn't that funny. So I'm still torn.
Well look, you don 't really like the one from uptown and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done! <+++++> Y 'know, you're right. Thank you.
Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal. <+++++> What?
I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win. <+++++> What?
We 're at my stop. But would you like to have coffee? <+++++> Are we really in Montreal?!
Yes we are. So, coffee? <+++++> Coffee sounds great.  Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I 've missed the last 1200 times. <+++++> So why don 't you quit?
You don 't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria. <+++++> Who is Maria?
Oh Maria. You can 't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym treat. <+++++> You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
No! <+++++> So you 're strong enough to face her on your own?
Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it 's against my oath as a masseuse. <+++++> They make you take an oath?
I don 't what your talking about. <+++++> Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
Yes.  Yes! <+++++> One more time,  "Hey, don't you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"
No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts! <+++++> Good! That 's good!
Okay, Dave in the membership office, handles quitters.  Uh, excuse me,  are you a member? <+++++> Me? No.
I wanna quit the gym. <+++++> It 's okay man, be strong.
So, are you a member of any gym. <+++++> No! And I 'm not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.
Wait, now so you joined the gym? <+++++> And that 's funny, why?
Well, you could actually go to the gym. <+++++> Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
Hey. <+++++> Hey!
On the touchy. <+++++> And that 's not against your oath?!
Hi. <+++++> We 'd like to close our accounts.
Close your accounts? Is there some kind of problem? <+++++> No-no.
So you didn 't leave the bank? <+++++> No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.
Hey! <+++++> Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
All right. I 'm gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I'm ready to have Frank and Alice's embryo transferred into my uterus. <+++++> Now, how will they know if you 're ready?
Okay everyone, think thick. <+++++> Good-bye! Good luck!
And you Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel 's bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there. <+++++> You 're good.  These are not.
Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag? <+++++> Five.
Six. <+++++> Challenge extended.
Deal! <+++++> Challenge excepted.
All right, we 'll start with apples. <+++++> We 'll be starting with apples.
Diet soda. <+++++> Yes. Yes. Yes.
Ha-ha! <+++++> They have another guess.
I got it! Scotch tape. <+++++> How did you know she would buy scotch tape?
Ross will do it. <+++++> Oh sure,  "Ross will do it!" It's not like he has a job, or a child, or a life of his own.
Fine! We 'll ask Phoebe. <+++++> No-no-no, I-I wanna play.
I know. <+++++> The test is ready.

Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era. <+++++> I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.
Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek. <+++++> Fine by me; hope she wins.
It doesn't say that. Does it? <+++++> How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
Sixty guests. <+++++> So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?
Um, would you like to come in? <+++++> Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?

I'd rather not. <+++++> Oh, yeah, why not?
So, you just left? Her place was really that bad? <+++++> You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
Yeah. <+++++> Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived!  Here.
Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened? <+++++> What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.
All right, so... next time, you take her to your place. <+++++> No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.
What kind of smell? <+++++> I don't know. Soap?
All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right? <+++++> Yeah.
You wanna see her again, right? <+++++> Yeah.
So you're gonna have to do it in the mess! <+++++> Yeah, okay you're right.

Hey guys! <+++++> Hi Janine!
Well I 'm gonna be on it this year. I'm gonna be one of the party people. <+++++> You 're gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!
Well actually they 're taping tomorrow. I don't really understand why. <+++++> Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.
Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too? <+++++> Are you serious?
Thanks.  Great so we can all go together! I gotta run. Catch you later! <+++++> Bye!
Bye! <+++++> Bye Janine!
Well, that 's a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick. <+++++> It was a dry day.
We are going to Dick Clark 's New Year's Rocking Eve! <+++++> Oh my God!
OK, listen I 've been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It's a show, but we're just dancing, OK? It's no big deal. The important thing to remember - stay cool. <+++++> Got it!
Got it! <+++++> Oh my God it 's just like I dreamed it!
OK, everyone gather up. <+++++> 'Scuse us
Here 's what's gonna happen. The music's gonna start, you're gonna dance, we're gonna tape, you don't look at the camera. Any questions? <+++++> Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?
Okay, here comes another camera. <+++++> Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
Right. No biggie. Stay loose. <+++++> Why do they keep doing that?
If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They 've been taping those people up there all day. <+++++> Right.
Right. <+++++> Hey, what 'd you guys do to get up on there?
Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants? <+++++> Yeah!
Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just..  Here we go.  Looking good Gellers! <+++++> We know!
Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He 's the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him. <+++++> Okay.
Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren 't wearing underpants? <+++++> Monica!  Would it?
Man, this sucks! Y 'know if Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who's gonna be the losers then? <+++++> Hey, I know what 'll get us up on a platform!
What? <+++++> The routine!
Ross, we haven 't done the routine since middle school. <+++++> Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he 'll wanna build us our own platform!
Was it really that good? <+++++> We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it 's almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?
5 6 7 8! <+++++> So, do we really have to ask who 's going up on the platform next?
I know! Hey, you haven 't been practising the routine, have you? <+++++> No!
Me too! <+++++> Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y 'know?
Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens, happens. Destiny. <+++++> Three, Two, One!
What? We could do it! <+++++> I don 't know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
I can do it, okay? Come on, let 's go. <+++++> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Look at that! <+++++> How weird is that? Y 'know? You're moving in with me and have the one thing I don 't have. It's like uh, in a way you-you complete me  kitchen.
What?! <+++++> You complete me kitchen, matey!
Ross, I know what you 're thinking. <+++++> What?
That she 's gonna move in with you and maybe then she'll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you're already married, she'll just be happy. Y'know? You're just, you're very sad. <+++++> Oh my God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!
What?!! <+++++> Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you 're obsessed with her. It's always, "Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?" "Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel?" "When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?" You want her!
No! <+++++> Uh-oh, saved by the bell.  Hello?
That you 're a liar. <+++++> No-no-no, that 's great! I'll be there Monday. And thank you again!  Okay.   Umm, that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say? <+++++> Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it.
Well, who wouldn 't?! <+++++> I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it 's temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? "Professor Geller."
No,  'cause she didn't tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I've only got a week left, y'know? I've really gotta start living now! , leans back, and starts reading.) <+++++> Hey everyone!
Oh hi! <+++++> Hey uh, well, today 's my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?
Oh that 'd be great. Sure! <+++++> "There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct "
Oh, this is it. This what 's gonna kill me. <+++++> " subcategories. The first of these subcategories is "
Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper? <+++++> No! Why?
Well, I 've just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn't have naked chicks on it. <+++++> Ohh! Okay! Okay.  "There are three  primary theories concerning sediment flow rate.   Each of these theories  can be further subcategorized  into "
Why don 't you open with a joke? <+++++> Open with a joke? It 's a university, not a comedy club!
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You 're not talking about Chuckles University?! <+++++> Okay!
Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring? <+++++> Thank you!
Oh-ooh-ooh! Y 'know what's a good visual aide? <+++++> Please don 't say naked chicks.
Why not?! <+++++> I-I-I don 't even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y'know what? I'm just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
Yeah.  Nice try! <+++++> Hello!
How 'd the lecture go? <+++++> It went great! And I didn 't need any jokes or naked chicks either!
Wow, that 's great Ross, I'm sorry we weren't more supportive before. <+++++> I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone 's all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I'm gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.
That you 're not funny or sexy? <+++++> That 's right!
Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There 's some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa.  Hey sisters!   Wow, we really are bitches. <+++++> Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when - Oh bloody hell.
What the hell are you doing?! <+++++> Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
Yeah, and not a very good one. <+++++> Will you-will you please?
Dr. Geller, Kurt Rathman, I 'm a professor in the paleontology department here. <+++++> Oh.
Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture? <+++++> I 'm sorry, I've got plans with my sister.
Monica Gellerrr. <+++++> Right, will you excuse us for one moment?   What are you doing?
Oh, you can have an accent and I can 't?!  Top 'O the morning to ya laddies! <+++++> Just please stop!
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them. <+++++> Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they 're probably not even listening! <+++++> They 're not listening too me?
Of course they 're listening to you! Everybody listens to you. <+++++> Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
What 's happening to your accent? <+++++> Come again? What 's-what's this nonsense?   All right, I'm-I'm not English. I'm from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I'm sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions?  About paleontology.  All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I'm-I'm hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression
Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!! <+++++> Well, hello Rachel!
Yes, the hard part is truly over. <+++++> No, but come on, we 're off to a great start aren't we? I knew I'd get you here fast, but this has got to be some kind of a record!
How are you doing? <+++++> Wait a minute! How-how the hell did you beat us here?
We took a cab. Did you guys walk? <+++++> N No! We took a cab too, but I did test runs!
Hey! You made it! <+++++> Okay is there some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?!

What-what if I was the president?! <+++++> Well then we 'd be in a lot of trouble, you don't know where any countries are.  Okay.  Uh, say would you umm Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have  opened up?
Okay. Y 'know what? I'd have to say I really don't care for your tone. And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem to-Whoa!  Oh gosh! Whoa! <+++++> What-what?
I 'll be back in an hour to check you again. <+++++> Thank you.

This is your grandmother 's engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel. <+++++> Mom no, come on! Thank you.
Just hear me out! <+++++> N-no! Okay? We 've been through this! We're not gonna get married just because she's pregnant, okay?
Honestly! Ross, this isn 't just some girl you picked up in a bar and humped. A child should have a family. <+++++> Mom, y 'know what? I-I can't deal with this right now. I'm sorry
Just think about it. If you don't, I'll talk more about humping. <+++++> Gimmie!
Yeah.  Why aren 't you with Rachel? <+++++> Are you kidding? Look, we 're not gonna be together just because we're having a baby. Okay?
But y 'know what? It just seems that you two belong together. <+++++> Okay, stop it! I can 't deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby.

Ugh, is she pregnant yet? She doesn 't need to be; she'll still have the baby before I do. Oh Ross, another contraction! <+++++> That 's it. That's it.

I can 't. I can't push anymore, I can't. <+++++> Sweetie you 're doing great.
Here we go! Okay, keep pushing! Wait! I see something. <+++++> What? You do? You do?  Oh my God!
Don 't say, "Oh my God!" Oh my God what? <+++++> What is that?
It 's the baby's buttock, she's breech. <+++++> Oh thank God, I thought she had two heads.
She 's gonna be fine. Okay, she's in a more difficult position so you're gonna have to push even harder now. Go! Push! <+++++> Go!
I 'm sorry, I can't! <+++++> Yes you can!
I can 't! <+++++> Hey! Hey! Come on! You can! I know you can do this! Let 's go!
I can 't. Please, you do it for me. <+++++> No! Come on let 's-One more time! One final push! Ready? 1 2 3!
Good! <+++++> Keep pushing!
Are you okay? <+++++> You have no idea how much this hurts.  Keep going! Keep going!
Here we go! <+++++> Oh! Oh! She 's upside down but she's coming! She's coming!
Oh God! <+++++> Oh! Oh my God oh! Oh my God she 's here.
Oh! Oh my God oh! Oh my God she 's here. <+++++> Oh she 's she's perfect.
Oh, she 's so tiny.  Where'd she go? <+++++> Oh it 's okay. They're just-they're just wrapping her up.
Can we come in? <+++++> Oh, come in.
Oh nothing I Sorry, I just can 't stop crying. <+++++> The doctor says it 's completely normal with all the hormones. Plus, you-you're sleep deprived.
Oh, wait a minute it 's not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original! <+++++> Uh actually, we-we 've narrowed it down to two names.
Yeah, and y 'know what? I love them both, so why don't you just pick one and that'll be it. <+++++> Wow! Umm, okay uh everyone this is Isabella.  What?
What was the other one Ross? <+++++> Umm, Delilah.
Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore. <+++++> So I guess we 're back to uh, Baby Girl.
It 's okay honey, you'll find a name. <+++++> Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going to be.
Well That 's y'know-That's-We've been alone for the last twenty minutes we're doing okay. Besides y'know what? I-I-Maybe we won't be alone, 'cause lately I-I-things have been happening between me and Ross, y'know? Right before I went into labor, we-we had this kiss. Y'know? So it might be the the beginning of something. <+++++> Hey Janice!
Oh hi! <+++++> Who 's this little guy?
Say hello to Aaron, your future son-in-law. <+++++> No-no. No.
I 'm gonna leave the three of you alone. <+++++> Okay.
Bye. <+++++> Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?
Uh-huh.  Y 'know what I was, I was thinking about? <+++++> Huh?
Umm that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some- something huh? <+++++> Yeah. Yeah, it really was. But we we gotta be careful. We we can't let that happen again, y'know?
Right. <+++++> I mean we don 't want to go down that road do we?
No! No, of course not. No. That 's why I brought it up.  They didn't have any sodas? <+++++> Oh my God! I 'm sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot.
Is she in there? <+++++> Yeah. She 's putting her down now, that's her.
Oh! <+++++> Look at Emma!
I just can 't decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel? <+++++> Oh what are you kidding? She 's gorgeous, it's all Rachel.
I 'm sorry, for the last time, why aren't you two together again?  No, I know. I know, because you're not in that place. Which would be fine, except you totally are. <+++++> It 's it's complicated okay?
Yeah that 's true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer. <+++++> Look, we 've been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby.  It's just if-if we got together again and it didn't work out I could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking everything- Oh that's now me. What do they put something in the water in this place? Since Rachel and I we're doing really, we're doing really well right now.
I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it. <+++++> Yeah, exactly.
Oh, some guy she met at the movies. <+++++> Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her?
Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight. <+++++> 
Hang in there, it's gonna happen. <+++++> Wha, OK, now how do you know that?
Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent. <+++++> Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.
No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you. <+++++> Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them.
That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy. <+++++> No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella.
I think she's OK. <+++++> 
What? <+++++> I'm Ross Geller. Wha, I'm, God in your add you said you were pretty but wow.
What are you, what are you doin'? <+++++> Oh, oh my God, is this the wrong day? I don't believe it, uh, well, hey, I guess if it works out we'll, we'll have something to tell the grandkids.
Sure will. I've uh, gotta go. Take care. <+++++> OK, see ya later, nice meeting you.
What? <+++++> I was saving you.
Saving, saving, saving me from the pleasant conversation with the interesting man, saving me? <+++++> Oh, see from where I was sitting I uh. . .
OK, Ross, listen to me, I am not yours to save. <+++++> But, you are.
What? <+++++> Uh, uh, well you're, umm, you're my lobster.

See um, lobsters, uhh, in the tank when, when they're old, uhh, they get with, uhh, they walk around holding the claws. In the tank, ya know, with, with the holding and. . .

Do the claws again. <+++++> Rach. OK, forget, forget the lobsters OK. We're, let's talk, what about us?
Ross, there is no us, OK. <+++++> No, but. . .
No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not worth it. <+++++> Well, but, but. . .
NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that. <+++++> E-except, except that what?
No, no, ACC-cept that. <+++++> Oh.
You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush. I'm just saying, it's right there. <+++++> Hey guys.
Hi, darling. Where's my grandson, you didn't bring him? <+++++> No, he's at uh, Carol's and Susan's today.
Where have you been? <+++++> Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?
No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet. <+++++> C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.
Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about. We taught her well. Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go? <+++++> In the bank.
You have dinosaur checks? <+++++> Yeah, yeah I mean, you get your money and you learn a little something, what's wrong with that?
Hey, you got me, put it in. <+++++> 
Hi. <+++++> Hi.

Oh, the guys are here. <+++++> this summer?
Your mother's right. Take her, you can wear my tux. <+++++> Dad, she won't want to go with me.
Of course she would, you're a college man. <+++++> I don't know.
I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh. <+++++> OK. Hold my board.
No, no, no. <+++++> OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.
Let's show 'em. <+++++> Uh, just a sec dad.
I can't believe you did that. <+++++> Yeah, well.
Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild. <+++++> This screen is amazing, I mean Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.
Hi you guys. <+++++> Hey.
Hey you. <+++++> Hey you.
So, uh, how was your day? <+++++> Oh you know, pretty much the usual, uh, sun shining, birds chirping.
Hey cool, mine too. <+++++> 
C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a little. . . hard to follow. <+++++> I told you there was going to be sub-titles.
Monica. <+++++> It would really help when I'm kissing you if you didn't shout out my sister's name.
Honey, I'm just checking. <+++++> Oh.
Monica. <+++++> Mon.
Monica. <+++++> Mon.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry, it's just that when you moved your hands down to my butt, it was like woah, Ross's hands are on my butt. Sorry. <+++++> And that's, that's funny why?
Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing. <+++++> I, I know it's big, I just didn't know it was uh, ha-ha big.
I know, I know, I know, I know. I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I'm good, I'm not gonna laugh anymore. OK put your hands back there. <+++++> No see now, now I can't because uh, I'm feeling too self conscious.
Just one cheek. <+++++> Nuh, uh, the moment's gone.
Alright, just put your hands out and I'll back up into them. <+++++> That's romantic.
C'mon touch it. <+++++> No.
Oh, come on squeeze it. <+++++> No.
Rub it. <+++++> No.
What're you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel? <+++++> That was 14 hours ago.
So how'd it go? <+++++> Oh. Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin'?
She laughed at you? <+++++> Yeah. I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know. And I just want it to be perfect and right and. . . why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint?
Hey. <+++++> Hey.
OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you. <+++++> No, you, ya know there's no need to make it u. . . how?
Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh, maybe going back to my place for um, dessert. <+++++> Humm, that sounds, I don't, perfect.
Hi you guys. <+++++> Hey.
Hey. <+++++> Well we just wanted to stop by and uh, say goodnight.
Goodnight. <+++++> Look at that, they won't even turn their heads.
Stop sending food to our apartment. <+++++> Well, why're you all dressed up?
You're not the only one who has a date tonight. <+++++> What? You have a date? Who with?
No one. <+++++> C'mon, what's his name?
Nothing. <+++++> Come on, tell me.
Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental. <+++++> Oh, I promise, what.
It's Richard Burke. <+++++> Who's Richard Burke? Doc, Doctor Burke? You have a date with Doctor Burke? Why, why, why should that bother me? I, I love that man, he's like a uh, brother to dad.
Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with. <+++++> Doctor Burke is sexy?
Oh God, absolutely. <+++++> 
I know. <+++++> 
It's OK, it's fine. <+++++> KARL!
Oh. <+++++> I'm done.
Yeah well, you know what, so is uh, Sorentino's. <+++++> Wha, OK, I'm sorry, let's uh, why don't we find someplace else.
No, you know what, it's late, everything's gonna be closed. Why don't we just do it another night? <+++++> No, no, we won't.
We won't? <+++++> 
What is this? What are we doing? <+++++> Shh. Do you want cran-apple or cran-grape?
Grape. <+++++> 
Ah, so what are we looking at? <+++++> Well uh, you see that, that little cluster of stars next to the big one? That is Ursa Major.
Really? <+++++> I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK. <+++++> What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
Hi you. I can't believe I'm waking up next to you. <+++++> I know it is pretty unbelievaaaaah.
What? <+++++> We're not alone.
Oh my god. Oh my god.  Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me! <+++++> Rach!
Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you? <+++++> It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?
What? <+++++> You're bleeding.
I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything. <+++++> Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.
You, you, you said he liked me.  You, you slowpokes! <+++++> That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler.
What up?! <+++++> Everyone, this is Julie.
Julie. <+++++> Ohh.  Hi!
Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me. <+++++> And bus.
Oh my god. <+++++> 
 <+++++> You gotta hear this story.
We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old... <+++++> 200 at least.
Well, Ross and I were in grad school together. <+++++> But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
It's an expression. <+++++> Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.
And then we've gotta get some sleep. <+++++> Yeah, it's really 6
Yeah, sure. <+++++> Thank you.
So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know. <+++++> I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?
God? <+++++> It was you, pal.
Well, maybe it was God, doing me. <+++++> Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.
Here's your lemonade. <+++++> I didn't order lemonade.
Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that. <+++++> But...
Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you. <+++++> Hello? Hi.
Okay. <+++++> Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What?  Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three.  Well you didn't hang up either.
She didn't hang up either! <+++++> Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...
Sorry, I thought you were talking to me. <+++++> Rachel! I'll just call her back.
Okay! <+++++> Hi?
My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake. <+++++> Hi!
Hi! <+++++> Hi. Sorry we're late but we were -well, there was touching.
Hey, hey Ross. <+++++> Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?
I do Raquel. <+++++> So, uh, he's back.
Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem? <+++++> No, not a problem.
It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign. <+++++> How's the hair?
Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in. <+++++> 
Frankie? What're you talking about? <+++++> Hey, what's goin' on?
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me. <+++++> What?
Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite... <+++++> What?
That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear.  What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants? <+++++> Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?
Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better. <+++++> I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.
Thank you. <+++++> Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.
Wait, are you leaving? <+++++> Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by  "bye!"
Well, can I talk to you for a sec? <+++++> Okay.
Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what? <+++++> Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?
No. No-no-no-no. <+++++> Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actually -I-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.
Really? <+++++> You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie.  Was there a second of all?
No, I think that was the whole all. <+++++> Okay.
Oh, it 's a poster for that World War I movie that I'm in, check it out. <+++++> Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!
Uh-huh! I know. I 'm coming soon to a theater near you! I'm in THX! I'm unsuitable for children! <+++++> Now I cannot wait to see this.
That 's right, still no baby!  Come on people! Please make some room! <+++++> Uh sweetie, maybe you 'd be more comfortable here?
You. Like you haven 't done enough. <+++++> Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do. I mean I wish I were a seahorse.  Because with seahorses it 's the male, they carry the babies. And then also umm, I'd be far away in the sea.
Until then, General Grant, why don 't you set up camp  right there. <+++++> Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor 's appointment.
She 's in the bathroom. <+++++> Rach, we gotta go.
In a minute!!! <+++++> People ask me why we 're not together, I just don't know what to tell them.
All right, all right. Let 's go! <+++++> Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctor 's keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry
No, I 'm fine. <+++++> Really? You don 't think that's a little inappropriate.
Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am somewhat comfortable. <+++++> Fine! Fine! Y 'know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You're the mommy.
Ross. <+++++> Yeah?
Can I ask you something? <+++++> Uh-huh.
When Carol was pregnant with Ben <+++++> Mmm?
were you this irritating? <+++++> Wow!
Excuse me?! <+++++> Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, you 've been a little short with me lately. I'm not trying to irritate you.
Well then you just must have a natural talent for it. <+++++> Y 'know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don't we not speak until then.
Okay.  Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That 's great! <+++++> Y 'know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that's half human and half pure evil!
Hi Dr. Long, how are you? <+++++> Oh, you 're nice to her.
You 're about 80 percent effaced, so you're on your way. It still could last a little while longer. If you're anxious there are a few ways to help things along. <+++++> Do them!!
taking a long walk, and then there's the one that's proved most effective <+++++> You 've got to be kidding me!
Hey! <+++++> Hey.
No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor. <+++++> Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.
Well what is it? What is it? If it 's gonna help bring the baby here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it. <+++++> It 's sex.
Do it! <+++++> Monica!
All right, let 's be practical, if Ross isn't willing to do it, he's not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow Chandler-Chandler is good! <+++++> Monica, what is the matter with you?
Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you 're gonna have the baby and I don't want to lose again! <+++++> What?! While she 's been going through this hell, you've been making money?! You're betting on your friend staying in this misery?!
I 'll take that bet. <+++++> What?!
Well, I 'm miserable here! I might as well make some money out it! <+++++> Can I get some of that action?
Ross I -We tried all the spicy food. It's not working. <+++++> Okay here, have one of these peppers. Oh ha Oh God! So so hot!  Oh my- By the way, you don't want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye.
I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you. <+++++> Stop it.
Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We know what 's gonna work! It's doctor recommended! <+++++> I 'm sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, I'm dying.
Oh come on Ross, we 've done it before we'll do it again, it'll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy. <+++++> This is insane, I 'm not gonna make love to you just so that you'll go into labor.
Make love? What are you a girl? <+++++> Always a great way to get in a man 's pants.
But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle, y 'know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out. <+++++> I love when you talk dirty to me.
Oh, I know it. You 're right. That's not sexy. Oh Oh!  Whoops! Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bed over and get it.  Oh God! <+++++> Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen.
Come on Ross! I 'm miserable here! Come on! You started this, now you finish it! Come on wuss, make love to me. <+++++> Y 'know what?
What?! <+++++> Forget it.
Oh wow! What now Ross you 're not gonna talk? How on earth will you ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know.  I mean you'd think the damn jalepeno would've cleared up your sinuses, but no!! That's not enough  What are you doing?! <+++++> I 'm getting that baby out of you!
Oh God! <+++++> Oh, I know.
Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke. <+++++> I am good. Okay! Okay! Uh, I got the pillow! I got the bag! You got the keys?
Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay! <+++++> Hey!
Yeah. <+++++> We 're having a baby.
I didn 't uh, really have time to read this part of the books, but do you think we have time to <+++++> Not so much.
I cannot believe that you didn 't tell me that we are still married!! <+++++> Look I was going to tell you!
Ross! <+++++> Okay, maybe it wasn 't my best decision. But I just couldn't face another failed marriage.
Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage? <+++++> Rach, come on, if you think about it, it 's actually kinda funny.  Okay, maybe it's best not to think about it.
Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core! <+++++> Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye. <+++++> Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2
Well sure, if you say you 're gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms!  All right, now I'm gonna do this my way and I don't want to hear a peep out of you! <+++++> Okay Rach, but
Ross! Y 'know what, I just got-why? Why did you do this?! <+++++> Look I told you
I don 't wanna hear "Three failed marriages!" <+++++> Look, if you 'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand!
Well, y 'know what? Thanks to you I'm half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I don't think I have ever been this angry! <+++++> What about the time I said we were on a break?
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable. <+++++> Fine, I 'm mentally unstable.
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user. <+++++> What?!
Uh yes, heroin and crack. <+++++> Crack isn 't even an intravenous drug!
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage? <+++++> Oh, come on!
And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you 're gay and addicted to heroin. <+++++> Okay, I 'm sorry, this is insane! I-I-I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I 'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!
That won 't be necessary. <+++++> And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don 't qualify for an annulment. If you two don't want to be together you'll have to file for divorce. <+++++> That 's great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!
What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense! <+++++> And what --What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don't get the annulment. Don't type that! What?! Stop typing!  Hey! Stop typing!  Stop typing! Stop typing!!
All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one! <+++++> Yeah!
This is totally your fault! <+++++> My fault?! You threatened the judge!
Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter 's machine!! <+++++> That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
Don 't call us that! <+++++> The judge wouldn 't let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?
Oh honey thank God you 're home, I was getting worried. <+++++> I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I 've already signed everything and I put little 'X's where you need to sign.
Oh, little  'X's! Great! That makes up for everything! <+++++> Y 'know, I-I-you've done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?
Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one! <+++++> Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!
Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you! <+++++> Yeah! Right!
Yeah! Right! <+++++> You 're right. That's very different. So let's, let's just sign the papers. All right?  What?
Nothing. <+++++> Okay, can we just sign please?
Uh-hmm. <+++++> Congratulations.
Okay Ross, we 're-wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession. <+++++> What?
Well, y 'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea. <+++++> Excuse me?
Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married? <+++++> Yeah?
And uh, yeah, I didn 't really, I didn't want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then  to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess. <+++++> So then if-if -I mean if you think about it, this is all  your fault.
Yeah, don 't push it though. <+++++> I 've got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.
I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn 't be a secret, and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut. <+++++> Did I, did I even treat?
No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special. <+++++> That may be the most depressing thing I 've heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer's office.
Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this. <+++++> Eh, no problem.
I 'm gonna need a copy of those. <+++++> Totally.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Yeah well, we 'll see. <+++++> You kissed her.
Hey! We 're here! <+++++> Hey!
Ohh! Oh my God! <+++++> You like it?
Oh no! <+++++> It 's my new apothecary table!
Ross! Phoebe 's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this! <+++++> Well why not?! She 'll-she'll love it! It's the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.
I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she 's gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original. <+++++> Why did you do that?
Because she hates Pottery Barn. <+++++> She hates Pottery Barn?!!
I know! I know, she says it 's all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff.  So come on, she's gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please? <+++++> What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe -Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!
Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets! <+++++> Uh, yeah! I still can 't believe she hates Pottery Barn!
Ross, get over it! It 's not like she hates you. <+++++> Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y 'know what I think? It's just she-she's weird. Y'know it's because she's a twin. Twins are weird.
Ross, she 's not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind. <+++++> Huh. Y 'know what's not one of a kind? A twin!
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Okay. Hey -Ooh, cool sheets! <+++++> Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?
That 's funny. <+++++> Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new  old sheet?
Ohh!! <+++++> My apothecary table!!!
Ross, where did you get this?! <+++++> I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
Well this doesn 't even smell like opium. <+++++> Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
see I can't decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table. <+++++> Wow! I didn 't know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
I know, I know. I went a little crazy. <+++++> A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!
Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that. <+++++> Fascinating.
Ah! <+++++> Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel?
Oh, come on! I think he 's ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk. <+++++> Really?!  Hey, y 'know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here's-here's 60 bucks, why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
Oh, she does want to. <+++++> She does want to.
Yeah! Yeah. I 'll be all right. <+++++> Y 'know what would cheer you up?
What? <+++++> I 'm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture! <+++++> Y'know if we ever go to war and you 're captured, you're in for a big surprise.
Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe? <+++++> Yeah! Oh my God!
" Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease  " Darn it! Now, I don't know who to get to the next verse. <+++++> Oh, you could just go uh,  " greatest of ease  BAH-bah-bha-bhannn. " Then go right into it.
Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about  'bah- bah-bha-bhan?' <+++++> Well umm, y 'know, I used to play.
Oh yeah, that 's right, the keyboards, huh? <+++++> Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that 's-that's when I really found my sound.
Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound. <+++++> Yeah.
I wanna hear  "The Sound." <+++++> Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven 't played in so long, and-and, well it's-it's really personal stuff, y'know?
Yeah! <+++++> No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in -No, yeah, okay.
All right! Bring it on, you <+++++> Here we go.  Y 'know, I've-I've never played my stuff for anyone before, so it's important that-that you understand it's about communicating very private emotions.  Y'know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That's what I'm
Wow, it was so -wow! <+++++> Really?! I mean, really?!!
Yeah, I mean, you should play in public! <+++++> Wow! Thanks, you guys. That 's uh-ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I'll be right back! Okay?  This is so nice, I'm-I am so
Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great! <+++++> Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don 't want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?
Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah. <+++++> Pheebs
Yeah, I-I can 't-I mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just-I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I <+++++> See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y 'know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I I won't play anymore.
Oh no. No-no-no, don 't do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music. <+++++> Yeah, okay.
I kissed Kathy. <+++++> What?
You obviously haven 't screwed over a lot of your friends.  Which we all appreciate. <+++++> No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would 've just stepped aside.
Then why didn 't you tell me to do that?!! <+++++> Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.
Yeah, I know. <+++++> Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.
Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves. <+++++> Thank you, thanks.  Yeah, I lost it. Y 'know, I'm not gonna play anymore,  would you, can you finish my set?
After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help. <+++++> Yeah, like I could lose it.
What? <+++++> I played bad on purpose guys.
Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time. <+++++> Yeah -no, just that last song.
Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play! <+++++> People can hear you.
Wow! She looks great. Doesn 't she? <+++++> Yeah.
Hi! <+++++> That is one good looking man!
Oh, yeah! Ooh, that 's nice. <+++++> Dude!
If you want it to be. <+++++> Here 's your girlfriend's button.
Ooh! How was Kathy 's play? <+++++> Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin ' guy.
Chandler, look they 're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them. <+++++> Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. <+++++> Yeah.
Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood. <+++++> They 're not a couple!
Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot? <+++++> Oh yeah!
Look, you guys have been to every play I 've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage? <+++++> No.
So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight? <+++++> Y 'know what, I don't know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
Yeah, I know but <+++++> Oh no-no-no, I 'm there.
Listen also we 're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over. <+++++> Oh yeah!
The players. <+++++> Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
I 'm right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there's no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means! <+++++> All right, let 's not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there! <+++++> Here she comes. Don 't say a word, okay? Just be cool, don't be y'know you.
Hey you guys! <+++++> Hey!
Hi!  Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it tonight? <+++++> Oh, absolutely!
Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you 're having sex with him. <+++++> Okay, I
Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh- u -a! Joshua! Josh. <+++++> Uh, hello!
Please, have some! <+++++> Oh, yumm!
Yeah, it 's just something I picked up. <+++++> Cookies and porn, you 're the best mom ever!!
Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there. <+++++> Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?
It 's Joshua. <+++++> Oh, whatever.
Steps!  Slut!  You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy! <+++++> What?!
What?! <+++++> So you were right?
I confronted her, and she didn 't deny it!  I don't live here! <+++++> Chandler!
No! Forget her, man! You don 't need her, you don't need that! <+++++> He 's right, what she did was unforgivable.
Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong? <+++++> How might you be wrong?
She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross! <+++++> That 's all you're basing this on?
I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket. <+++++> So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?
Just come. <+++++> Oh my God!
Great! <+++++> This is beautiful!
So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I 'm just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit. <+++++> Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?
Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I 'm always the hostess. <+++++> Hey!
She is now. <+++++> What are you saying?
Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone. <+++++> Well, if-if she thought they were on a break
Tell him. <+++++> It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!
All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday? <+++++> Why?
I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist. <+++++> Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.
Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie? <+++++> Hmm? Oh, yeah.
No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today. <+++++> Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?
Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out. <+++++> Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?
Hey, so can you make it on Friday? <+++++> What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?
It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York , and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco. <+++++> Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities.
What? <+++++> Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em.
Here, let me.  Rachel Green's line, how may I help you? <+++++> Hi, is Rachel there?
And who may I say is calling? <+++++> This is Ross?
Ross of..... <+++++> Of Ross and Rachel.
Oh hi. It's, it's Mark. <+++++> Oh hey, hey Mark.
Hey, hold on a second. <+++++> Okay.
Hi honey! <+++++> Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone?
Oh, he's just goofing around. <+++++> Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in his own office?
Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants. <+++++> Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she?
Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do? <+++++> What?
I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go.  Mark, I need you! <+++++> Okay, bye-bye.
Ow! Ross!! <+++++> Oh, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry sweetie, I was just trying to ah, I'm dialing another number.
Wh-what's that? <+++++> It's from Ross, it's a love bug.
All right Ross!! I get it!! <+++++> I mean my God...
You're hurt! <+++++> ...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!!
Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk! <+++++> I would never do that!
Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do. <+++++> Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot.
Mark's a genius! <+++++> Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you. <+++++> What am I going to do?
Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits. <+++++> I don't know you guys.
Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me. <+++++> All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!
What is going on? <+++++> What's going on?!  That's what's going on!!
Ross! <+++++> I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! What do I have to do to get some service?!  Hi Rach.
And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and  whoa-whoa- whoa, sh-she's naked! <+++++> Hi.
Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen. <+++++> I'm sorry, I was an idiot.
A big idiot. <+++++> A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.
Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now? <+++++> Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.
Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous. <+++++> I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.
Where ya going? <+++++> Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.
Ohh, with who? <+++++> Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.
There was a woman at the...  The stripper?! <+++++> Yeah.
Man, I gotta get a kid. <+++++> Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?
Sure, is she married? <+++++> Ahh, no.
Oh. <+++++> Are you jealous?
Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own? <+++++> You are totally jealous.
I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I... <+++++> Honey, I love you too.
Ugh. Wait, wait, wait. <+++++> What?
What? <+++++> Huh.
Wow, it 's like a dirty math problem. <+++++> I 'm sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
Does anybody need more coffee? <+++++> Yeah, I 'll take some.
Oh, that is so unfortunate. <+++++> What?
Bye-bye!  That 's why I moved out. <+++++> Hey, y'know while we 're on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don't live here anymore.
I think on some levels she already knows. <+++++> Phoebe, she doesn 't know that you sneak out every night, she doesn't know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn't know that you've been living with your Grandmother's for a week now.
Hey. <+++++> Hey.
Well let 's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that's plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing! <+++++> So how many more do you have tomorrow?
Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more! <+++++> Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.
What? <+++++> I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...
Umm, how 's it going with you guys? <+++++> Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.
Oh, really? <+++++> Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn 't really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it's gonna make a difference
So what are they doing? <+++++> I don 't know, something girlie.
Oh, it 's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong? <+++++> My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.
Oh no! Why? <+++++> 'Cause Carol's a lesbian.  And, and I'm not one. And apparently it's not a mix and match situation.
Oh my God! I don 't believe it! Oh, you poor bunny. <+++++> I 'm an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I'd be out and she'd, she'd see some beautiful woman, and, and she'd be Ross y'know look at her, and I'd think, God, my wife is cool!
Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover? <+++++> Well, now I do!!
I 'm sorry. <+++++> Seven years. I mean we 've been together seven years, she's the only woman who's ever loved me, and the only woman I've-I've ever....
I know no, no, y'know you don 't deserve this, you don't Ross. You're, you're really, you're so good. <+++++> Thanks.
And you 're so sweet.  And you're kind <+++++> Thanks.
Thanks. <+++++> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Oh. <+++++> Wait, wait, wait.
What? <+++++> My foot is stuck in the pocket.
What? <+++++> No, I can 't get it out.
Well, that 's not something a girl wants to hear. <+++++> No, come on don 't start.  Ouch!
What? <+++++> Stupid balls are in the way.
Stupid balls are in the way. <+++++> Oh well. It probably would 've been the most constructive solution.
You have chalk on your face. <+++++> Huh?
Hey, are you okay? <+++++> My wife 's a lesbian.
Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross. <+++++> Hi.
W-wait. What is that? <+++++> 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him? <+++++> My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment? <+++++> Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...
Why don't you just get a roommate? <+++++> Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe-  ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.
Might wanna open with the snowman. <+++++> Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.
Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job. <+++++> How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner. <+++++> Yeah, okay. Alright.
Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm. <+++++> Woooo! Yeah!
Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much? <+++++> Just a smidge.
What?! <+++++> C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!
Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again! <+++++> Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
Do you always have to bring him here? <+++++> I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you. <+++++> Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
There. Now there is. <+++++> Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
Uh, four. <+++++> Four.
Five. <+++++> Five.
Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do? <+++++> Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?
Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who. <+++++> Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.
What's the matter? <+++++> Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...
That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night. <+++++> Really.
Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing. <+++++> What, uh... what juggling thing?
With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that. <+++++> No.
Yeah. That's okay, right? <+++++> Par-tay!
That thing is not coming in here. <+++++> 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?
I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table. <+++++> Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
Alright. Just keep him away from me. <+++++> Thank you.  C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling?  Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.
Hey, kids... <+++++> Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing. <+++++> What?
Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother. <+++++> Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs! <+++++> Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
See, there's always one guy.   "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes." <+++++> Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.
Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live! <+++++> Joey, uh- OM nipotent.
How does she do that? <+++++> I cannot sleep in a public place.
Oh! What what what! ...Hi. <+++++> It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.
I got no sleep last night! <+++++> Why?
We love you, man. <+++++> Funny, my birthday was seven months ago.
So? <+++++> So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?
Well, aren't we Mr.  "The glass is half empty." <+++++> Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?
Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember. <+++++> Ohhh.
Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone? <+++++> Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship.  Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.
C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy,  Huh? Huh? Huh? <+++++> What are you doing?
C'mon, Ross! <+++++> Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?
Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job. <+++++> You can totally, totally live on this.
Yeah, yeah. <+++++> Oh, by the way, great service tonight.
We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes. <+++++> Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we-  Sorry. Sorry.
What? <+++++> Peach pit.
Yes, Bunny? <+++++> Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
-Peaches? <+++++> Actually, nectarines, but basically...
Could've been a peach. <+++++> Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the-  -the bus stop... I'm fine.
What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans? <+++++> No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks. <+++++> Pass it! Pass it!
He's open! <+++++> Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
Hold on.  Fill these out, sit over there. <+++++> Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented.
Any minute now. <+++++> Hey, this-  Heyy...
He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that. <+++++> Look, it's just a little more complicated...
Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women? <+++++> Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...
Then what? <+++++> My first time with Carol was...
What? <+++++> It was my first time.
Hey, buddy. <+++++> Hi. (He is wearing a piece of steel bandaged to his nose.
Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight. <+++++> Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
Oh, ah- the kid has it. <+++++> The kid...?  Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.
You gotta do it, man. <+++++> Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever --can't do it.  Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.

Nooo!   Hello?  Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much.  Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really. <+++++> Green. To the green.
Hey! <+++++> Hi!
Who wants French toast? <+++++> Oh, I 'll have some!
Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks <+++++> Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
What in God 's name is that?! <+++++> Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven 't seen that since the forth grade!
Hey! Ross! <+++++> Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
I need to talk to you, it 's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler. <+++++> Oh my God! Of course, of course.  Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other 's hometowns? Why don't you   Wh-what's going on?
Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y 'know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days? <+++++> Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what 's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Nothing -Why?! <+++++> Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
Oh yeah it is! I 'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes. <+++++> Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
Oh Ross, hi. <+++++> Phoebe, what are you doing?
I 'm sorry, I'm with a client right now. <+++++> Phoebe!
Okay, let 's talk outside. <+++++> Phoebe, you can 't massage people in my apartment!
What 's the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler's! <+++++> And they knew about it?
Okay, well Ross, what is this really about? <+++++> Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!
Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don 't know what the big deal is! <+++++> The big deal is I don 't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle-beer! Cold beer.
Hi, is uh Phoebe here? <+++++> Uh no-no, she-she 's out for the night.
Ohh great. <+++++> Can I, can I help you with something?
Well, I don 't know. Are you a masseur? <+++++> Yes I am.
Oh, y 'know what? It's probably just your burnin' loins. <+++++> Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
Nothing! <+++++> Damn, this coffee 's cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins?
Y 'know, I can not believe you told him, Joey! <+++++> So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you. <+++++> Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines!    'Sup?
Ross! How could you do that to an old man?! <+++++> Excuse me ladies.  I 'm sorry?
My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon. <+++++> I gave him an extremely professional massage!
He said you poked at him with wooden spoons. <+++++> Okay, so it wasn 't uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.
Well, he 's never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week! <+++++> Hey, y 'know what? This is your fault! You're the one that didn't move his-his appointment.
Oh, it 's my fault?! You didn 't have to massage him! You could've sent him away! You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back! <+++++> He said he liked that!! Oh you 're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
Dude, what are you massaging an old man for? <+++++> His daughter was hot.
Hi. <+++++> Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency.
Oh, yeah go ahead. <+++++> Uh, before we do uh, are any of Joey 's special romance magazines in there?
No. No. <+++++> Okay! All clear!
Ben, its Rachel!  But whatever. <+++++> Everything okay in there?
Awww, just like his daddy. <+++++> Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean 's office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?
What-what about Monica? <+++++> Oh, she isn 't home.
So it would just be, me alone? <+++++> Well, Ben would be there.
Huh umm <+++++> What 's the matter?
Well that -y'know it's just uh, I've never done that before. Me and him alone. <+++++> Rach, he 's not an ex-con.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him? <+++++> I don 't know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.
Okay. <+++++> Okay.  Ben? Come here. All right, I 'm gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?
Yeah I think so. <+++++> I wasn 't talking to you.
I 'll be okay. <+++++> Okay, I 'll see you soon buddy.  Be back in an hour.
Coming. <+++++> I have a bone to pick with you.
Uh-oh. <+++++> Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
Oh yeah? Did he pull the old <+++++> That 's right! That's right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
Oh that. <+++++> Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They 're mean and they're stupid and-and I don't want my son learning them!
Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don 't think that's just a little funny?! <+++++> I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?
Very good. <+++++> Rachel! What are you doing here?
I 'm just visiting my good friend Carol. <+++++> Your good friend?
Yeah! <+++++> What 's her last name?
Carol Lesbian? <+++++> Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?
What line? <+++++> Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh,   "Dude, don't you ever was your face?"
All right, I 'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you but you were so mad already! <+++++> Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it 's not funny!
Hey Ross! <+++++> Hi.
What 's not funny? <+++++> Practical jokes.
Oh I I think they're funny. <+++++> You have a line down your face.
Or Carol! But they 're funny to kids and who is it hurting?! <+++++> Uh, y 'know what? I'll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal's office wearing nothing but a catcher's mitt!
That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout,  "I will be revenged?!" <+++++> I will be! Listen, I don 't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
Fine. Fine, but I 'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want! <+++++> No that 's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I
Hey! <+++++> Hey I 'm sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I've got this meeting at school. And- and he-he asked for his uh, 'Fun Aunt' Rachel, so
Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don 't we Ben? <+++++> Okay, I 'll see you later pal.
Ohh, okay.  Wh-Ah-ha!  Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can't do it. <+++++> What?
I can 't let him go out that way, he's got a meeting.  You've got something here on your back. <+++++> What?  That 's great. That is great.  What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
What did we just finish talking about Ben?! <+++++> All right, that 's it!  Come-you-no! You are in big trouble young man!
No you guys <+++++> I-I-am -
Hey! <+++++> Hi!
Sure! <+++++> I'd love to!
Well, I can't give you a massage, because my licence has been revoked again! <+++++> Phoebe, what happened?
"Look, this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok?"  "Oh, thank you very much!"  Yeah, I'm going to Vermont... <+++++> Oh, don't worry about it! Just use your travel insurance.
I don't have travel insurance. <+++++> Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!
Why don't you take Ross? <+++++> Uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn...
No, not if their room has two beds! <+++++> I guess...It still seems a little... moonlight boat ride!!
New York. <+++++> The big apple!
I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here. <+++++> Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody.
Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please? <+++++> Check again please!
I'm sorry, it's not here. <+++++> Not there.
I don't know what to say. <+++++> She doesn't know what to say!
That's insane! <+++++> Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves.
What!? They are totally ripping us off! <+++++> Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six!
Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there! <+++++> C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!
Dude, you're shaking! <+++++> I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?
Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room?  Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already?  Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons. <+++++> What did you get?
USA Today <+++++> Nice, put it with the others.
And I also got... two more apples. <+++++> We are four short of a bush-o . God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!
I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant. <+++++> Oh, that's not cool.
Dude, none of this is cool. <+++++> No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example
I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that. <+++++> Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.
Ok, how about this ? <+++++> No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!
Thank you, thank you very much! <+++++> Let's celebrate with some maple candy!
No! <+++++> At least tell me where you hid it.
Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax. <+++++> Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game.
Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game. <+++++> Oh my god.
What? <+++++> There's something new in the bowl.
Look, we have enough, just walk away. <+++++> No, but I want...I want the pinecones!
There's a forest right outside. <+++++> It's not the same.
Ok, go quick! <+++++> Thank you for a delightful stay.
Thank you for a delightful stay. <+++++> Oh, my maple candy!
Besides tampons and salt?  Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you.  That's weird...it's empty! <+++++> Hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...?  do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?
I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving. <+++++> Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
And we're done with the chicken fried rice. <+++++> Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!
Good idea! Yes! <+++++> It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it. <+++++> Ohh.
Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!! <+++++> What's going on?
HI!! Hi! <+++++> What?! What?!
Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment! <+++++> Actually, it looks really good.
I have quarters! <+++++> Hey!
Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet? <+++++> Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.
Oh. <+++++> No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to
Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it? <+++++> No.
That new mountain bike? <+++++> No.
Well what did you send? <+++++> A basket of mini-muffins.
But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send? <+++++> The small one.
What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment? <+++++> Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
Your work makes me sad. <+++++> Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
Bye! <+++++> Bye!
Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment? <+++++> Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!
Y'know what you should do? <+++++> Huh?
See? <+++++> That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.
He broke that. <+++++> Well, he had gravity boots.
So he likes to break stuff. <+++++> Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out.  Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming. <+++++> Right.
I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet. <+++++> Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum? <+++++> Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to work. I -What?  No! Wh What are you doing?!!  GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross.   Hold on!  Hey Ross. What's up bro? <+++++> What the hell are doing?!!
Dude! He's right there! <+++++> I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too. <+++++> My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this.   You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!
Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while. <+++++> What? What? What?! You guys knew?  You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!
Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react. <+++++> You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react?
I call Godfather! <+++++> You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
Hi! <+++++> Hi!
Hey! I brought you some house warming gifts. <+++++> Aww.
Yeah. Salt, so your life always has flavor. <+++++> Huh.
Bread, so you never go hungry. <+++++> Ohh.
And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know. <+++++> Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.
Hi! <+++++> Hi!
Welcome to the building. I'm uh, Steve Sarah; I'm president of the tenants committee. <+++++> Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.
I came to talk to you about Howard. <+++++> Howard?
Yeah, he's the handy man. He's gonna be retiring next week and everyone who lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of thing. <+++++> Oh that's nice.
Yeah. So, do you want to give a check? Or <+++++> Oh. Uhh
Oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now! You can slip it under my door. <+++++> No-no, it's not that, it's just I-I just moved in.
Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years. <+++++> Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
Oh, okay, I get it. <+++++> No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.
Howard's the handy man! <+++++> Yes but too me he's just, man.
Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building. <+++++> Ugh, can you believe that guy!
Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that. <+++++> It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you. <+++++> Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.
It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable. <+++++> Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
By me? <+++++> Oh, no!
No-no. <+++++> Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard!  Howard! Howard! Howard!  Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard!  Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Yay!! <+++++> Phoebe!
Oh, hi Ross! <+++++> What are you doing?
See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in! <+++++> You chipped in?!
Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars. <+++++> Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be. <+++++> Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
That's what I'm saying. <+++++> Phoebe? Phoebe?
Ooh. <+++++> Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?
No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay? <+++++> So uh, what did you tell them about me?
Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy. <+++++> Ohh.
But somehow you came off as the bad guy. <+++++> What?!
Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there. <+++++> Ohh, this cake is really good!
3-B! <+++++> Oh yeah, aww!
Yeah, leave! <+++++> Yeah, get out! Now!
Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero. <+++++> Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
Will you marry me? <+++++> Oh-no. No. No.
Who? Two divorces and Joey?! <+++++> Hey!
She's right y'know. <+++++> Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife? <+++++> No, I will not!
Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it. <+++++> You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time. <+++++> This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole  "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?
Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union of Ross and Emily.  Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross... <+++++> I Ross...
Take thee, Emily... <+++++> Take thee, Rachel... Emily.  Emily.
I think we 'd better start again. Ross, repeat after me. I, Ross <+++++> I, Ross
Take thee, EM-I-LY <+++++> Take thee,  Emily.  Like there 'd be anybody else.
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, till death parts us. <+++++> As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily.
May I have the rings?  Emily, place this ring on Ross 's finger as a symbol of your bond everlasting.  Ross, place this ring in Emily's hand as a symbol of the love that encircles you forever. <+++++> Happy too.
Ross and Emily have made their declarations and it gives me great pleasure to declare them husband and wife. <+++++> Yay!
Just keep smiling. <+++++> Okay.
It could 've been worse, he could've shot her. <+++++> That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn 't it?
Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right? <+++++> That-that-that 's all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I'll be right out here.  She's just fixing her makeup.
I hate you!! <+++++> And, I love you!!
Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross? <+++++> That 's true, thanks dad.  People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!!
Oh, hi! <+++++> Hi!
Hi. Sorry, things aren 't working out so well. <+++++> Oh no! It could be better, but it 's gonna be okay, right?
Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she 's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, "I take thee circus freak." Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right? <+++++> No! No! Of course it didn 't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you
Right <+++++> But it absolutely didn 't.  It didn't!! It didn't!!
Ross, hey, the band 's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so <+++++> Oh! Oh-oh, the band 's ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says-I don't care about the stupid band!!
You spit on me man! <+++++> Look, I 'm sorry.
Y 'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame. <+++++> Oh, right!
Get the hell out of there, y 'know? <+++++> Emily? Emily? I 'm coming in.
Okay! <+++++> Emily?!
You didn 't find her? <+++++> No, I 've looked everywhere!
Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. <+++++> No! For all I know, she 's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place.  Right here.
Yeah, we 're gonna go. <+++++> Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
Yeah, it 's a very large plane. <+++++> That 's cool.
But, we 'll stay here with you. <+++++> Thanks guys!  I really appreciate this, y 'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.
We can 't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it. <+++++> Em-Emily?  Em-Emily?  Emily!
We 've come for her things. <+++++> Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
Goodbye Geller. <+++++> Now, hold on! Hold on!  Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I 'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all!  That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
Hi! <+++++> Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?
Well, I-I-I 've been on Standby for a flight home for hours. <+++++> Oh.
Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh? <+++++> Not yet.
This is the last call for Flight 1066 to Athens. The last call. <+++++> Pretty soon I guess.
Yeah. I 'm sorry. <+++++> I just, I don 't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?
No, you 're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love. <+++++> Same difference.
All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to Athens should now be on board. <+++++> I get it! Well, that 's that.
No, you know what, I think you should go. <+++++> What?
Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it 'd be really good. <+++++> Oh, I don 't, I don't, I don't know
Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you! <+++++> I could, yeah, I can do that.
Yeah. <+++++> I can 't, I can't even believe her! No, y'know what, I am, I am gonna go!
Good! <+++++> I know, why not?
Right! <+++++> Right?
Right! <+++++> Y 'know-thanks!
Okay, I 'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here. <+++++> Yeah, well nah.
What? Wait, what? <+++++> Why don 't you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?
Well-well, I don 't know Ross-really? <+++++> Yeah, yeah, it 'll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?
Uh-huh. <+++++> No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.
Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that! <+++++> Okay!
Okay! <+++++> Cool!
All right! <+++++> Come on!  Here.
Oh, okay, we 're going. Yeah. <+++++> Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
Oh, wait-wait-wait <+++++> You tell them to wait!
Okay. Wait! Wait! <+++++> Emily.
Emily. <+++++> Oh no-no-no! Oh-no!  No! No! Emily!
Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it! <+++++> yeah thats a great idea!
yeah thats a great idea! <+++++> No thanks!
You don't wanna win the lottery? <+++++> Uh...sure I do, and I also wanna be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.
Still on Amelia Earhart? <+++++> The woman just vanished!
Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this? <+++++> No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
I like those odds! <+++++> Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki.
I'll ask.  Boohaki? <+++++> Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.
That was a good day! <+++++> They're towing your car, they're towing your car!!
I'm parked in a garage on Morton! <+++++> They're towing a car. And I am seeing...spots.
So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks? <+++++> Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!
Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it!! <+++++> Think he washed his hands?
Ooh! Tough odds! <+++++> Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery!
Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work. <+++++> A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a chance!
I won, hey! <+++++> You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp!  Ah!! That thing gets hot!!
You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually do win? <+++++> Uh, you're not gonna win.
Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel? You know, we're gonna be all like "oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the cape" and you're gonna be all like "oh, I can't guys, I'll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai" <+++++> Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that.
I can see the headline now <+++++> Why would I eat my own arm?
You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you. <+++++> Why?
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this. <+++++> You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! Come here
Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win? <+++++> I don't know, probably just invest it.
Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it? <+++++> Oh, I'm sorry, did I say "invest it"? I meant "be cool and piss it all away"
You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds. <+++++> Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?
I'll take this one too  Uh ... Mommy? <+++++> Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel "Mommy" when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...
I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word. <+++++> Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me "Daddy" too.
Oooh, I like that, "daddy" <+++++> I ... I was just talking about Rachel.
Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me? <+++++> Well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi ..  no I can't.
Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed. <+++++> I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this together!
Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago! <+++++> 3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ...
Yeah, I want my tickets too ! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah! <+++++> Than I want mine, too ! And if I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.
OOOOOHHHHH! <+++++> Hey, hey!!
They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra ... <+++++> Monica!
Ok, good!  You guys were so scared! There was no way I was gonna dump this... Oh God, no!  I think I broke your bowl. <+++++> Go, go, go!!
So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win, remember? <+++++> Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon...
Oh God, I am so sorry honey... <+++++> Oh, so sorry man! Sorry!
You know what? We should call my mum's house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down. <+++++> Oh yeah, it's a good idea!
131! <+++++> Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And remember, you're daddy's little girl...  Phoebe's totally ruined that for me...
I got that! <+++++> Oh, we have one too!!
We are on a roll, people!! <+++++> Come on!!
Guys, you're not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight to Emma and she said her first words!! <+++++> Wow!
Isn't that amazing? <+++++> Oh yeah, no no no...that's great!
Why-why aren't you more excited? <+++++> Oh, Rach...oh..."gleba" is not a word.
Oh, but of course it is! <+++++> Okay, what does it mean?
I don't know all the words. <+++++> I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's first words .
I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's first words . <+++++> Yes you did, gleba is a word!
Yes you did, gleba is a word! <+++++> Ok, use it in a sentence.
Ok... "Emma just said gleba"! <+++++> It's not a word!
Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up . <+++++> Oh, oh, ok, great. You know what, while you're at it she said another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up
Alright, okay, okay, gleba, gleba...  Gleba! Ha! Here it is <+++++> She's gonna be a scientist!
You know what? There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win. <+++++> Me too. So much for my dinosaur/Amelia Earhart theme park.
You guys, what was the Powerball number again? <+++++> Seven.
Don't tear it. <+++++> Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers.
Me too. <+++++> I guess if everybody else is...
Could you guys help me? <+++++> Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you.
It-it's really heavy. <+++++> I got it.   So hi, I 'm uh, I'm Ross and this is my friend Chandler.
I-I am Kristen. <+++++> Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area,  'cause if you are I'd love to show you around sometime.
I I uh, actually just moved from four blocks over. <+++++> Ah.
But-but this block is like a whole other world. <+++++> Y 'know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system.  Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep!
Excuse me? <+++++> Umm, say you 're gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?
Oh I 'd like that. <+++++> Yeah?
Yeah. <+++++> Great! Uh, let me take this up for you.
After you. <+++++> Oh no-no, after you.   Oh my God!
So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet? <+++++> Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she 'd like to go out again.
Huh. <+++++> Yeah in fact, I 'm gonna go call her right now. And I'll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says
Oh yeah? <+++++> Hey.
Hi! How 'd it go? <+++++> Oh great! We 're going out again Saturday. But I just found she's also seeing some other guy.
Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I 'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy. But, I don't know, I'm not to worried about it. <+++++> Well you shouldn 't be. Believe me I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you.  I mean that doofus is going to lose!
So this is nice! I wish I didn 't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to.  Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating? <+++++> Kristen Lang.
Obviously! So, how do we decide? <+++++> Well now let 's-let's look at this objectively, I think I should date her
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or , or I'm the one who dates her. <+++++> That 's interesting, but check this out. I date her
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction <+++++> Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
Yeah well we should order some food then. <+++++> No Joey! Look why don 't, why don't we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we'll each go out with her one more time. And-and we 'll see who she likes best.
That sounds fair. <+++++> Maybe I 'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street
Ah yeah -wait a second now! Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that. <+++++> Well sorry, that 's what I do on dates.
All right, well I guess I 'll just have to do what I do on dates. <+++++> So let 's decide on the spending limit
Yeah. Uh,  a slice  six dollars? <+++++> I was thinking more like a hundred.
Hey! <+++++> Hey! What 's up?
I just wanted to come by and y 'know, wish you good luck on your date. <+++++> Oh thanks!
Yeah. What time are you meeting her? <+++++> We have 8
Wow, that 's in like 20 minutes. You'd better get dressed. <+++++> I am dressed.
Oh. Well good!  For me.  What is this? Did you give yourself a facial? <+++++> I have an oily T-zone!
Okay dude!  Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers. <+++++> That 's right.
You spent a hundred dollars. That 's the limit. You're screwed! <+++++> Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally, technically I didn 't break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
Oh-oh! So that 's the way it's gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y'know! <+++++> Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
I don 't know. <+++++> Why am I not surprised?
Y 'know what Ross? I'm not gonna let you get away with this! <+++++> I don 't think you have much choice.
Well we 'll see! <+++++> Bye-bye!
Yeah bye-bye!  Hey! So just a light layer? <+++++> Yes. Yes. Just here  and there .
Oh great! <+++++> Yeah.
Is your back feeling better? <+++++> Oh yeah it 's fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.
Hi! <+++++> Hi.  It 's nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don't anymore.
Our table will be ready in a couple minutes. <+++++> Yeah. So
Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks! <+++++> So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?
Well Joey doesn 't like to talk about it but, he's one of the stars of Days Of Our Lives. <+++++> That 's right! That's right, don't you play a woman?
A woman in a man 's body. <+++++> Much better.
So y 'know Ross it's funny 'cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married? <+++++> Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I 've been married and how I have a son.
Yeah, little Eric. <+++++> That 's right! Wait no, Ben.
So you 've just married the one time then? <+++++> Well umm
You 've been married twice? <+++++> Yes. And another time after that. Boy I 'm getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?
Do you two know each other? <+++++> No. No.
No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge. <+++++> Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?! <+++++> Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?! <+++++> Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!
When do you think we lost her? <+++++> Probably around gonorrhea.
I 'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone. <+++++> Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we 're gonna have younger looking skin!
Hey, you guys! <+++++> Hey!
So, what do you think? <+++++> About what?
I got glasses! <+++++> Well, you-you 've always had glasses.
No I didn 't! <+++++> Are you sure?
Nothing, I just like to go like this. <+++++> Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
Uh why, do you have a lecture? <+++++> No, why?
Then free as a bird. What 's up? <+++++> My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
Wow! That 's great! Dad must really like you, he doesn't ask just anyone to play. <+++++> Yeah and he didn 't really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.
Well, did-did you correct him? <+++++> No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.
This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week. <+++++> Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.
Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win. <+++++> Yeah.
Oh no problem, maybe I 'll play with my left hand. <+++++> You 're not a lefty?
Because I 'm normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present. <+++++> Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
Don 't worry about it Pheebs. <+++++> No one got me an engagement present.
Okay, we owe you a present. <+++++> Two! I 've been engaged twice!
I can 't believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is this crumb.  I wish you a long and happy marriage. <+++++> Hey.
Hey! How was it? <+++++> Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand
I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad. <+++++> And what did he ask you not to call him?
Guys? <+++++> Over here.
Why do they put so much steam in there?! <+++++> 'Cause otherwise they'd have to call it the room room.
Not that big a deal? There there was touching of things. <+++++> Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?
I don 't want him to tell this story for years. <+++++> Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
I wasn 't escaping. <+++++> Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
I was trying to help out a squirrel. <+++++> You were trying to eat it!
All right, I 'm off to see your dad. <+++++> Whoa-whoa, aren 't you a little over dressed?
Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face -And by face I don't mean his lap. And by face, I don't mean my ass. <+++++> Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
I don 't know. Y'know, they didn't get us anything. <+++++> Thank you!
Hey. <+++++> Hey.
Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean! <+++++> Yeeeeeep Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad 's boat she wouldn't let me help at all.
Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn 't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets. <+++++> You have to respect the sea!
Okay, here 's batch 22. Ohh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg. <+++++> Let 's give it a shot.
No, just a Friday night. <+++++> Ohh, these are pretty good.
Yeah, but not as good as batch 17. <+++++> Which one was that?
The ones we had right after you almost threw up. <+++++> Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16.  I 'm okay.
Are there anymore from the good batch?  'Cause we could just work off of those. <+++++> Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh  It's batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way!
Y 'know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she's l-l-lookin' up at us and smiling right now. <+++++> Looking up?
Well, I 've tried everything. I give up. I guess I'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe.  Kids love that right. <+++++> Aww, Pheeb, come on isn 't there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?
Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that 's not happening 'til October 15th, 2032. <+++++> That 's the day you're gonna die? See-darnit, I've got shuffleboard that day.
Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal. <+++++> Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care. <+++++> Multiple orgasms!
Not a one. <+++++> Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony. <+++++> Tony?
Does anybody want anything else? <+++++> Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing.  Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.
It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible. <+++++> That guy, he burns me up.
You don't say. <+++++> So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama. <+++++> Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
Who? <+++++> Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?
Don't you have a laundry room in your building? <+++++> Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through? <+++++> It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date. <+++++> Nuh-uh.
Yuh-huh. <+++++> So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear -you want it to be dirty? <+++++> No.
Oh, and uh, the fabric softener? <+++++> Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.
No suds, no save. Ok? <+++++> What's goin' on?
Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine. <+++++> Was your basket on top?
Yeah, but, there were no suds. <+++++> So?
Well, you know, no suds, no save. <+++++> No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second.  That's my friend's machine.
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it. <+++++> Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it. <+++++> All right, show's over. Nothing to see here.  Ok, let's do laundry.
That was amazing. I can't even send back soup. <+++++> Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
What's that? <+++++> Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.
Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough. <+++++> Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?
Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants? <+++++> Rach, have you never done this before?
Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin. <+++++> Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates? <+++++> Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do. <+++++> That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me?  I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
What uh-oh? <+++++> Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing.  Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
Ross, what's the matter? <+++++> Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
Come on, show me. <+++++> All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
Oh, everything's pink. <+++++> Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
Yes! Did you see that? <+++++> You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
I could not have done this without you. <+++++> Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer?  I'm fine, I'm fine.
Are you sure? <+++++> No.
Oh, are you sure you're ok? <+++++> Yeah.
Does it still hurt? <+++++> Yeah.
We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves. <+++++> What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.' <+++++> C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
You can say that because she's not your mom. <+++++> Oh, please...
Oh, hi sweetie. <+++++> When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
Last night. <+++++> Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.
Now why would she say that's embarrassing? <+++++> Shhh.
Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love... <+++++> Awww!
Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little. <+++++> What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
There y'go. Ross? <+++++> Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time. <+++++> ...But a man can change.
You okay there, slugger? <+++++> Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
What is with you tonight? <+++++> Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
Okay, thank you.  It's the Italian Hand- Licker, isn't it. <+++++> No. It's the one he's licking.
She's supposed to be with you. <+++++> You're good.
Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why? <+++++> The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off. <+++++> When?
He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is. <+++++> The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
No, it's you! <+++++> Please.
No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy... <+++++> Right.
You are gonna be fine, believe me. <+++++> Uh-oh...
Yeah. <+++++> Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell...  Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?
Right. No big deal. <+++++> Okay.
In Bizarro World!! You broke the code! <+++++> What code?
What are you guys doing out here? <+++++> Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
Yeah, well, you don't have your racket. <+++++> No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. <+++++> Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.
Ross, how could you let this happen? <+++++> I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's...
You don't think my mom's sexy? <+++++> Well... not in the same way...
I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children? <+++++> Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...
Hey. <+++++> Hey.
What're you guys doing out here? <+++++> Well, not playing raquetball!
He forgot to leave his grip size! <+++++> He didn't get the goggles!
Ciao, bela. <+++++> Do they wait for me to do this?
So are you gonna tell him? <+++++> Why would I tell him?
How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might. <+++++> Oh...
Oh my God. <+++++> You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom? <+++++> Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh...  I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.
What? <+++++> I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-
Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened. <+++++> Thanks, man, big help.
I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking? <+++++> I wasn't- I mean, I-
Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you. <+++++> I know-
I can't believe you did this. <+++++> Chandler-
What are you mad at me for?! <+++++> Chandler-
Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did!  See what happens when you break the code? <+++++> Joey-
Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout. <+++++> I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
What was that? <+++++> Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...
Mother-Kisser...  I'll shut up. <+++++> Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare. <+++++> Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom! <+++++> We're rehearsing a Greek play.
That's very funny. We done now? <+++++> No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her. <+++++> Okay, 'you' can't, or  you can't?  Okay, that's my finger.  That's, that's my knee.  Still doing the play. Aaah!
Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything. <+++++> You're kidding.
No, no. He said  "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?" <+++++> Wow!
Then she came back with  "The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?" <+++++> 'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say  "When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"
That makes more sense. <+++++> So, what's going on now?
I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you!  I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. <+++++> Whaddya see?
Nice save. <+++++> Mrs. Bing.
Hey. <+++++> You mean that?
Yeah, why not.  So I told her. <+++++> Yeah? How'd it go?
Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse. <+++++> Well, howdya feel?
Pretty good! I told her. <+++++> Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh?  But.. we don't have to go down that road.
Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist... <+++++> Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it! <+++++> Nooo!
'Okay.  Okay, daddy we'll see you tomorrow night.  Okay bye-bye.' <+++++> We?
Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that 's okay. <+++++> Oh shoot, tomorrow 's not so good, I'm supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.
Ross, my father doesn 't hate you. <+++++> Please, he refers to me as  'wethead'.
I 'll go. <+++++> Fine.
Thank you. <+++++> Hi Gunther.
Guess what? <+++++> What?
I got a gig! <+++++> Yay!!
Well, it 's not a part, no. I'm teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension. <+++++> Come on! That 's great.
Yeah, yeah. It 's like my chance to give something back to the acting community. <+++++> Y 'know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
Um-hmm. <+++++> Nice to see you again Dr. Green.
So!   How 's the library? <+++++> Ugh, museum.
What happened to the library? <+++++> There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one.
You know what 's really good here, the lobster. What do you say shall I just order three. <+++++> Yeah, if you 're really hungry.  It was a joke, I made a joke.
What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of person that works at a library. <+++++> It 's not a library...
They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat? <+++++> It gives it a nice antiquey look.
Rust, is boat cancer, Ross. <+++++> Wow. I 'm sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that.
Okay. <+++++> Okay!
Aw honey stop! It 's not that bad. <+++++> Yeah.  Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must 've added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.
Yeah. That 's Daddy. <+++++> That 's Daddy?! But doesn't it bother you? You're a waitress.
Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I 'd be serving him sneezers. <+++++> So?
So. Ross, I 've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change. <+++++> You really serve people sneezers?
You kids ready? <+++++> Thanks again, Dr. Green.
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt. <+++++> Oh, ah, you don 't need that.
Why not? <+++++> The carbon, it 's messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.
What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh? <+++++> Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it 's a sickness really.
Yeah it is, it is.  We really, really have to do something about that. <+++++> I know.
Oh Daddy, no he didn 't mean anything by that, he really didn't. <+++++> Nothing I do means anything, really.
This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I 'll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right. <+++++> Well Mr. Big Shot is better than  'wethead'.
You had to do it, didn 't you? You couldn't just leave it alone. <+++++> Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there 's a bug in my food.
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already. <+++++> Yeah, I 'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
Yeah, I 'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall. <+++++> Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
All right, look, here 's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice. <+++++> Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn 't work.
Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that 's why you have got to be the bigger man here. <+++++> Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn 't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'
Okay, well can 't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me? <+++++> Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we 're never gonna get along.
Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don 't wanna have to have a separate room for you too!! <+++++> Okay, okay, okay.  I 'll get the bagels.
Baby. Ross. <+++++> Dr. Green. How are you?
Thanks for dinner last night. <+++++> Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.
Nice hair. What 'd ya do? Swim here? <+++++> Okay, that 's it, I can't take it anymore.
What? What? He 's interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here. <+++++> Oh, please. Sweetie it 's hopeless, okay, I'm just gonna go.
What?! <+++++> Look, look I 'm sorry. It's just that....
You 're still going to that chiropractor, that man couldn't get into medical school in Extapa! <+++++> Thank you! That 's what I keep saying.
Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor. <+++++> Uh.
Well that 's his last name. <+++++> And his first name.
And um, excuse me, he helps me. <+++++> Oh-ho please. Ask her how?
Oh God! <+++++> Argue with that.
Come on! You 're just titling!  Her legs are fine! <+++++> I know that!
I 'm sorry, let her? <+++++> What can I do, she doesn 't listen to me about renter's insurance either.
Well what if somebody steals something? How are you gonna run after him with one leg shorter than the other?! <+++++> Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?
I 'd love some juice. Thanks. <+++++> Okay.  Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?
Yeah honey, I 'm standing right there! Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet. <+++++> Excellent!
Yeah, baby! <+++++> What are you doing?
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some? <+++++> No thanks. I 'm 29.
Oh my God, I gotta go to work! <+++++> Oh sweetie, when do you think you 're going to get off tonight?
Oh I don 't know honey. It's gonna be really late. <+++++> Oh come on, not again.
I know. I 'm sorry. Look, I'll make a deal with you all right? Okay? <+++++> Hmm.
For every night that you 're asleep before I get home from work... <+++++> Yeah.
I will wake you up in a way that 's proved very popular in the past. <+++++> Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.
Hi. <+++++> Hey.
Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that 's he's going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff. <+++++> And what are you going to do for him?
I 'm going to let him. <+++++> Okay.
Morning. <+++++> Hey.
Oh, there 's no such thing as an innocent burger. <+++++> So, are you gonna see him again?
We 're not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children and I still do, so that's why we're just gonna be friends. <+++++> Naked friends.
Hi. <+++++> Hey.
You 've have lipstick right here . That's okay, it's mine, we just kissed. <+++++> Oh.
Yeah, me too. <+++++> Yeah, make that three.
Okay Ross, why don 't you come with me? <+++++> Okay.   What ah, what is the matter with you? What 's going on?
Robert 's coming out. <+++++> What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?
No. He.....he 's coming out of his shorts. <+++++> What?!
The man is showing brain. <+++++> Are you sure?  Hold on.  I 'm sorry you guys, that was a coffee and a....
Coffee. <+++++> Okay.
We could write it down for you? <+++++> No, no, that won 't be ah, that won't be necessary
Wellll? <+++++> Yeah, yeah, yeah!
What do we do? What do we do? <+++++> Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.
Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo 's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her. <+++++> Umm, Jo 's a girl, it's short for Josephine.
Hey. <+++++> Hey! How 'd the ah, basketball go?
What?  What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert?  Why are you laughing?! <+++++> Calm down. There 's no reason to get testy.
Hey!  How 's it going? <+++++> Good.
What?! <+++++> Joey 's asking if you've just ruined the first book he's ever loved that didn't star Jack Nicholson?
Listen, Robert 's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him? <+++++> Oh.
We can 't tell him, you can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff. <+++++> He 's right, even if it's to say something complementary.
Okay, listen Robert... <+++++> Hey, don 't we have to...
Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can 't get mad. <+++++> Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities.
Oh, I don 't know, I guess, Chris O'Donnel, John F. Kennedy, Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson. <+++++> Spiderman?
Peter Parker. <+++++> Thank you.
What about you honey, who would be on your list? <+++++> Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First, I 'll divide my perspective canidates into catergories....
Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank. <+++++> Oh, hi.
How are you? <+++++> Hey.
Three of your five, what? <+++++> Celebrities I 'm allowed to sleep with.
Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought. <+++++> Yeah, it 's hard okay, I only have two spots left.
All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to? <+++++> Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....
Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving. <+++++> Susan Sarandon.
Eh, y'know what, she 's to political, she probably wouldn't let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first. <+++++> And!! Isabella Rosselini.
What, like a number? <+++++> Hey!
Hi! Bye! <+++++> Okay, I 'm done with my choices, these are final.
Ooh, very official. <+++++> Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer.
And who laminated it? <+++++> That would be me.
All right let me see.  Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel? <+++++> Hey, it 's my list.
All right, but in the future... <+++++> Okay!! Okay!!
Come on! <+++++> Heavy thing, not getting lighter!
So we are going on two? <+++++> All right!!
Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right?  Okay, great.  You freak. <+++++> Thank you.
Um, coffee to go, please. <+++++> Isabella Rosselini.
Are you serious?  Oh my God. <+++++> Damn! I can 't believe I took her off my list.
Why?  'Cause otherwise you'd go for it? <+++++> Yeah, maybe.
Oh-oh, you lie. <+++++> What you don 't think I'd go up to her?
Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me. <+++++> Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
You know what honey, you go ahead, we 'll call her an alternate. <+++++> Okay, hold my crawler.
Honey, he 's about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn. <+++++> Hi! Hi, I 'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet , woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee?  Or maybe reimburse you for that one?
Aren 't you with that girl over there? <+++++> Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that 's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people,  so I'm allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it's flattery.
I 'm sorry. <+++++> Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don 't, don't just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
Yeah, for you. Is that the list? <+++++> Um, yeah.
May I see it? <+++++> Um, no.
Come on! <+++++> But, okay.
I 'm not on the list! <+++++> Um, see, but that 's not the final draft.
It 's laminated! <+++++> Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler  brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.
Y'know it 's ironic... <+++++> What?
...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there. <+++++> We 're just gonna be friends.
All right, give it back to me.  5 of hearts. <+++++> Real magic does exist.
I can 't tell you that, no. <+++++> Ah, somebody 's at the door on the ceiling.
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I 'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye.  I just did it.  I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it. <+++++> Oh, I got it.
I just saw Janice. <+++++> Oh.
Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know.... <+++++> Hey Chandler, there 's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then.
Hello-dillillio!! <+++++> Oh, somebody 's feeling better.
The most unbelievable thing happened to me today. <+++++> Hi!
Hi! So I 'm out having lunch at Monica's and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale 's and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he's gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview! <+++++> Wow!
I know! <+++++> What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?
Uh-huh! <+++++> And he 's, he's a total stranger?
Yeah! His name is um, Mark something. <+++++> Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.
What!? <+++++> Well, I 'm just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.
To be nice. <+++++> Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
No, only for sex. <+++++> Thank you.  So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?
I didn 't have to, because I was wearing my 'I heart Ross' sandwich board and ringing my bell. <+++++> Uh-huh.
No-no-no-no, no, it 's a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can't we savor the precious moments?  Those are some huge breasts you have. <+++++> Hi.
Hi. <+++++> Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.
Isn 't that great? <+++++> Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.
Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase,  'Hummina-hummina-hummina.' <+++++> That 's excellent.
Where 'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents. <+++++> Yeah.
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone. <+++++> Woooo hoooo!!!
I can 't remember which sister. <+++++> You see what men do! Don 't tell me men are not nice!  This is men!!
I mean, was it Gina? <+++++> Which one is Gina?
That 's all right. <+++++> That 's okay.
Can I talk to you for a second?! <+++++> Hey, Joey.
I just got off the phone with my sister. <+++++> Ah, which, which one?
Mary-Angela. <+++++> Mary-Angela.
Well, that 's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba. <+++++> All right, look, look, you 've got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela? <+++++> Where in Cuba?
I can 't believe Mark didn't call. It's Sunday night, and he didn't call. <+++++> Bummer.
Yeah, right. Look at you, you 're practically giddy. <+++++> No, I 'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.
Wait a minute, why don 't you just call Mark.  I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen. <+++++> But, you, you don 't want to seem too pushy.
Honey, it 's not pushy, he gave her his home number. <+++++> What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?
Yeah, and you don 't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me. <+++++> That 's right good things, that-that is what I said.
Hello, Mark? Hi, it 's Rachel Green.  Oh no, don't you apologize.  Yeah, I'll hold.  He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers. <+++++> That is so made up!
Yay! <+++++> There you go.
Oh, that is amazing! <+++++> Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I 'd expect nothing less.
I got to figure out what I 'm going to wear. <+++++> High collar and baggy pants say I 'm a pro.
Yeah! Right! Okay, I 'll see you guys later.  Woo hoo! <+++++> You go get  'em.  What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?
What? <+++++> 'Why don't you call him?!' Well, thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!
Are you crazy?! <+++++> Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
What?! Ross y'know this isn 't even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too? <+++++> No.
I mean don 't you trust her? <+++++> Well, yeah!
Then get over yourself! Grow up! <+++++> You grow up.
Hey! <+++++> Hi!
What are you doing here? <+++++> Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I...
Oh. <+++++> Hi.
Hi. <+++++> How 'd did it go?
Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn 't shut up. <+++++> I 'm so proud of you.
Me too! <+++++> Listen, I 'm ah, I'm sorry I've been so crazy and jealous and, it's just that I like you a lot, so...
I know. <+++++> Yeah.
Oh my God!! <+++++> Congratu!!  -lations-lations.
Oh, I 'm sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me. <+++++> Maybe he 's just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
Maybe he 's just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it? <+++++> Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?
All right, that 's it! He cannot do this to Phoebe.  This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime!  But, is he a big guy? <+++++> Ah, we 'll all go.  Come on.
Hi everyone. <+++++> And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table. <+++++> Whoooaa!
Whoooaa! <+++++> That's my sister.
Oh my God! What were you doing in a library? <+++++> Pheebs, what about you?
Um... Ross? <+++++> Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'
No way! <+++++> The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
You did not go! <+++++> Come on.
Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed. <+++++> Step back.
I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park. <+++++> Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course. <+++++> Come on.
No, he said we were holding up the people behind us. <+++++> And you didn't marry him because...?
I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of... <+++++> Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
Yeah right. <+++++> It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex- wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.
OK. <+++++> But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.
You don't. <+++++> Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.
Really? <+++++> Mmmm.
You do? <+++++> I do.
It's never gonna happen. <+++++> What?
You and Rachel. <+++++> What?  Why not?
Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone. <+++++> No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
Ross, you're mayor of the zone. <+++++> I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...
Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever. <+++++> I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment.  What? What, now?
Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...' <+++++> Shhhh!
What are you shushing? <+++++> We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen.  Don't you hear that?
Ahhhh! <+++++> See?
New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la... <+++++> OK, here goes.
Are you going to do it? <+++++> I'm going to do it.
Do you want any help? <+++++> You come out there, you're a dead man.
Good luck, man. <+++++> Thanks.  OK.
Hmmm... this is so nice. <+++++> OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
OK. <+++++> OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Ohhh!!!! <+++++> Yes, yes, that's right...
Oh, look at the little cat! <+++++> What?  Ow!
Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner. <+++++> Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
During a blackout? He'd get trampled! <+++++> Yeah?
Look at that! <+++++> So, um... where did Paolo come from?
Oh... Italy, I think. <+++++> No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat! <+++++> That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.
 <+++++> Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....
Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah.... <+++++> Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
I have absolutely no idea. <+++++> That's... that's classic.
Ross! <+++++> Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.
Thing? <+++++> Thing, yes. Thing.
Ah, you... have the sex? <+++++> No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um...
Bed? <+++++> No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way , of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.
Oh! <+++++> Yeah! Se vice?
Si. <+++++> So you do know a little English.
Poco... a leetle. <+++++> Do you know the word crapweasel?
No. <+++++> That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!
Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48.... <+++++> Thank you.
Thanks. <+++++> Kinda... spooky without any lights.
Bwah-hah-hah! <+++++> OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah... <+++++> Oh.. oh... oh.
No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies. <+++++> You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right? <+++++> Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!
Did you not get a good enough look the other day? <+++++> Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.
What's the matter with Rog? <+++++> Yeah.
Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy. <+++++> What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.
What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad. <+++++> Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?
I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail. <+++++> Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents. <+++++> That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
Isn't he good? <+++++> Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...
Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better! <+++++> Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!
Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger. <+++++> I dunno, there's just something about...
We hate that guy. <+++++> Yeah. Hate him.
Yeah. Hate him. <+++++> We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out? <+++++> ...No, we hate him.
Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain. <+++++> So Joey, you okay?
Hey. <+++++> Hey, Pheebs.
Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger. <+++++> Awww.
Yeah, right. <+++++> Aaawwwwww!!
Ohh <+++++> What 's the matter? You okay?
Ohhh <+++++> Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.
Too? <+++++> Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.
Do you mind telling us what it is? <+++++> Sorry, I 'm kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you 're not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!! <+++++> Oh!!
Oh well, they 're killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body. <+++++> What? A brain transplant?!
Yes, it 's a highly controversial procedure. <+++++> It 's ridiculous!
Well, I think it 's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months. <+++++> It 's winter, they are fewer people on the street.
Oh, tell me about it. And she 's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes. <+++++> Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the  "brain transplant," you are going to be her?
Oh no thanks. I don 't like any thing from my Scottish heritage. <+++++> What?!
Well it 's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories. <+++++> Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
No! No-no they 're not. They're still very angry! But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet. <+++++> Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!! <+++++> How did you know about that?!
We heard you play all the way from your apartment! <+++++> Were you the ones called the cops?!
That 's not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don't feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding. <+++++> Why not?
Because we hate them. <+++++> Come on that 's not fair! I mean you haven't even heard me play!
We have heard you play. <+++++> No, you 've heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I'm not going to tell you what song I'm gonna play either. But uh, let's just say when it's over I'll bet there will be a we bit o' celebration.
I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks. <+++++> Do you wanna start telling secrets?
No! <+++++> Now umm, remember I 'm still learning.
Now umm, remember I 'm still learning. <+++++> One, two, three, four!
One, two, three, four! <+++++> You know the song! Sing along!
You know the song! Sing along! <+++++> So?
Hey. <+++++> I found a note on my door,  "Come to Monica's quick, bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar. "
Yeah I 'll take that. <+++++> What 's up?
Monica and I are engaged. <+++++> Oh my God.  Congratulations.
Thanks. <+++++> Where is she?
Yeah, she 's been out there for twenty minutes, I'm surprised you didn't hear her on the way over. <+++++> Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling,  "I'm gay! I'm gay!" Can I bring her in?
Hi! <+++++> Wow! Happy Monica 's night!
Well thank you, you too. <+++++> Thanks.
Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married? <+++++> Well sure. But I get married all the time so
Ohh <+++++> You okay?
Yeah, I guess. I-I I mean, do-do you think we 're ever gonna have that? <+++++> You mean, we -you and me?
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone. <+++++> Oh good, you scared me for a minute.
Shake it off. <+++++> I mean -no, it's just 'cause, it's just 'cause you and I were like a nightmare.  No, but there was some good times.
No, absolutely. Y 'know like it was umm <+++++> Surely you can think of something good.
Yeah, just give me a minute!  Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing. <+++++> What?
Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff. <+++++> Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?
Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands. <+++++> My hands?
Yeah. <+++++> Yeah?
Uh-huh. <+++++> Way to go guys. Y 'know, you-you were really good at the stuff too.
Oh, I know. Hey, y 'know what we never did?  Oh no, not that.  We uh, we never had bonus night! <+++++> A what?
Y 'know, bonus night. Y'know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night. <+++++> One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?
Yeah-yeah, we never had that, <+++++> No.
Oh honey, but it is just about <+++++> It is! It is!
See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder! <+++++> Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw! <+++++> Yeah!
Honey I swear it we just kissed. <+++++> It was just a kiss.
Okay come on Phoebe, it 's nothing! Monica, come on! <+++++> Look let 's not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn 't even matter!
No! <+++++> Oh no!
No-no, it 's really not huge. <+++++> And; people thinking it 's huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.  Which we are not!
Hey. <+++++> Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air
What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn 't want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing. <+++++> Still thinking about it huh?
Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that?  Especially you! <+++++> Oh, who cares?
I care! <+++++> And so do I.
Y 'know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed? <+++++> Okay. Sure.
Am I going to let you watch me undress? <+++++> No!
What?! <+++++> Hey, here 's a thought.
Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?! <+++++> Got me.
Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?! <+++++> Uh, Rachel, I 've been thinking. I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I'm calling it off.
We 're not gonna do this, all right? She's just gonna think that we're doin' it. <+++++> Oh, I see, so everybody wins.
Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute! <+++++> Oww!
I 'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross. <+++++> Well, I 'm going to take off.  Congratulations man.
Thanks. <+++++> And uh, Rachel.
Yeah. <+++++> What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person who 's going to enjoy these bad boys  is me.
Good, you guys are all here! <+++++> Hey! What's up?
Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow! <+++++> Congratulations! Ohh, that's great!
This is your place? <+++++> Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing.
Damnit!! Did you move?! <+++++> Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place.  I'm Ross.
Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that? <+++++> You got ink on your lip.
Excuse me.  You should check this out, tell the other tenants. Apparently he's running around looking for some kind of a hot girl. <+++++> Who isn't?
Who isn't? <+++++> I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross.
I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman. <+++++> Nevermind!
No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in. <+++++> I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm
Jen. <+++++> Jen, I know this may sound a little  But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or
Sure! That would be nice. <+++++> Umm?
Oh! My number is on there.  Give me a call. <+++++> I will give you a call.
I'll see you later. <+++++> Okay!
Sure, I'll just get my coat.  Could you get that? <+++++> Sure.  Joey
Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine. <+++++> Man! They cannot get enough!
Oh my God! <+++++> It's all right.
Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me! <+++++> Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!
What?! <+++++> Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
Oh my God, she's so stupid! <+++++> Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay.
Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful. <+++++> Yeah, he's head of the department.
Are they? I didn't know I cared that much. <+++++> Hello.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either -Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh!  Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it. <+++++> Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo! <+++++> To be fair, he doesn 't seem to be impersonating Fonzie
What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie! <+++++> Again, it's not that he
Me too. <+++++> Hey! I just heard. What's up?
Ohh, get these things out of me! <+++++> Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain.
I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs! <+++++> I do too! I do too!
Argh! <+++++> Argh!
Argh! <+++++> Argh!
Oh my God. <+++++> You did it, man.
Bodington's! <+++++> Bodington's! Woohoo!
Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat -I don't want to talk about it. <+++++> Hey!
Hey, Ross, Bodington's! <+++++> Yeah!
That was good beer. <+++++> Ohh
Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys. <+++++> Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.
Later! <+++++> Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually,  she should be here by now. <+++++> Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece. <+++++> Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know - Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?
So you still hadn't heard from Emily? <+++++> No, not since I lost her at the airport.
I can't believe she can out run you man! <+++++> HEY, SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!!  Oh! You-you think you can be beat me? Let's go! Outside!!
Hi! <+++++> Hey!
Hey! <+++++> Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.
Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do. <+++++> That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.
Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel. <+++++> So, what? That's it?
Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool. <+++++> Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best.
Oh no, you're the best. <+++++> Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store!  Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.
Umm, hi! <+++++> Hi.
Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something. <+++++> She's doing her laundry.
What's that? <+++++> It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!
Oh, honey that's awful. <+++++> Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
But, it's not raining. <+++++> I can't catch a break!
Yes! <+++++> What thing?
Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might  end up hurting. <+++++> Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily.  My God, think of the massacre.
Mine! <+++++> Wait! It was my plan.
Nooo, I said we needed a new plan. <+++++> And, I came up with Atlantic City.
What 'cha readin'? <+++++> The paper.
Yeah, what's it about? <+++++> Events from around the globe.
Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong. <+++++> Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized
Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here. <+++++> Yeah.
Okay. <+++++> Go ahead.
Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh,  I'm still in love with you Ross. <+++++> Wow. Umm Huh I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
Wow. Umm Huh I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now. <+++++> What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious. <+++++> Why are you laughing?
Because , because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel  was like,  "You are such an idiot!" <+++++> Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
I'm sorry, that's not funny. <+++++> Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where my wife is.   "Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?" Don't know!
Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this? <+++++> Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is
The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily. <+++++> That is what the thing is.
Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that? <+++++> No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice. <+++++> No thank you for Thank you.
All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun! <+++++> Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait-wait!
Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now! <+++++> Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.
Ugh! <+++++> Yeah, I still don't know.  I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says,  "Kids welcome here." But that also says,  "Come here to me!"
What?! You say that to kids?!! <+++++> No! No! No! The  "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
You picked a great couch. <+++++> Yeah?
Yeah. Could you just sign right here please? <+++++> Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away! <+++++> Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you!  All right Rach, let's go!
Yeah!   Are you kiddin'? <+++++> Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on!
Oh. Oh! I can do it! <+++++> Yeah!
You two are really gonna enjoy that couch. <+++++> Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together.
Ross! <+++++> What's that supposed to mean?
Well you, her, I mean, she's very y'know. And you're like y'know. <+++++> Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.
Really? You two? <+++++> Yeah! Rach?
Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch. <+++++> Then tell him quickly.
Fine!  We went out. <+++++> Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!
Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser! <+++++> A loser you did it with  298 times!
Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here? <+++++> Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go. <+++++> Okay, go left. Left! Left!
Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left! <+++++> Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head! You can do it! You can do it!  Okay. You got it?
Yeah. <+++++> Good-good-good.
Oh-oh! <+++++> Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it?
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements. <+++++> Oh great! What, you brought Joey?
Hey! <+++++> Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!
Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so <+++++> Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it.  Okay Rach,  that's you. That's the couch.
Whoa-oh, what's-what's that? <+++++> Oh, that's me.
Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself. <+++++> No! That's-that's my arm!
Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch. <+++++> Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead.
Okay. <+++++> Come on, Chandler.
Come on, Chandler. <+++++> All right.  Okay, here we go!
All right.  Okay, here we go! <+++++> All right, ready?
Yeah. <+++++> Turn.
Okay. <+++++> Turn! Turn!
Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit. <+++++> Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot!  Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!! <+++++> Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.
You think?! <+++++> All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.
Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now. <+++++> I can't believe that didn't work!
You wanna return this couch?  It's cut in half! <+++++> That's what I'm telling you.
Did you cut this couch in half? <+++++> This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half!
You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?! <+++++> Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit.
I'll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars. <+++++> I take it.
Happy birthday!!! <+++++> Rach! Come on! Rach!
Chocolate-chip pancakes! <+++++> We 've got presents!
Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal. <+++++> Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
Y 'know, I'm still 29 in Guam. <+++++> Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?
Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross. <+++++> Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!
Ross, a sports car? Wouldn 't it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there? <+++++> That 's not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.
Hey, what 's the horsepower on this thing? <+++++> I don 't know, but-but look how shiny!
Oh, well get in line missy.  So, can I have a ride stud? <+++++> Hop in.  Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
Hop in.  Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life. <+++++> Damnit!
Well actually <+++++> No-no-no! It 's mine! It's-it's mine.
Monica 's wasted. <+++++> Maybe that will liven up this party.
A scooter! <+++++> Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
Well, I feel fine, but I think you 're bumming out the rest of the kids. <+++++> What?
No, so I don 't have to get married until I'm 33! That's three years, that's three whole years-Oh, wait a minute though. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty. <+++++> Which is fine! Because you just turned --twenty-eight!
I 'm telling you it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk. <+++++> You 're drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now! <+++++> I really wish that you wouldn 't.
Speech! Come on Monica! <+++++> Come on!
Ross, I really don 't think <+++++> Lift!! And slide!
Okay, here we go. <+++++> All right everyone, lift!  And slide!!
Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds. <+++++> God, do you realize in ten years we 're gonna be 40?
All-all right!  Start it up! Let 's go! <+++++> Woohoo!
How hot are we? <+++++> You wanna buy a car?
Ross, did you really read all these baby books? <+++++> Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that!
Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big?  This is your baby.  Hi Daddy! <+++++> Hello!
Ah, poke  a  nose, mmm <+++++> Mma, Mma, Mmaah
Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal! <+++++> Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?
I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally... <+++++> ...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration?  I could call immigration!
Hey hey, come on in! <+++++> Hey, hello! mmwa!  I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna.
Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat. <+++++> I'm pretty sure that it is...
So, I got the results of the amnio today. <+++++> Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....?
Totally and completely healthy! <+++++> Oh, that's great, that is great!
Oh, that's great, that is great! <+++++> Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?
Uh, that's our friend Tanya. <+++++> Of course it's your friend Tanya.
Don't you want to know about the sex? <+++++> The sex?  Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya , yaw...
The sex of the baby, Ross. <+++++> Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!
Do you want to know? <+++++> No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is!  Or isn't...
Oh, hello Ross! <+++++> Susan...
So, so, did you hear? <+++++> Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!
Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be... <+++++> Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!
Mm-hmmm <+++++> Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?
It's a... <+++++> No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want to know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go.
Well, thanks for the books. <+++++> No problem, ok, mmmwa  oh, mmmwa  Susan...
Hello? <+++++> Uh, never mind, I don't want to know.
And Monica knows... <+++++> Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
So what's it gonna be? <+++++> Wait -oh-hey-huh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
Hey Phoebe! <+++++> Hi Pheebs!
All right, you know Paolo? <+++++> I'm familiar with his work, yes...
 <+++++> My God.
Oh! <+++++> The actress!
The actress! <+++++> Thanks Rach.
So what are you gonna do? <+++++> You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?
She is gonna hate me. <+++++> Yeah, well...
So, what do you think? <+++++> I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
We should get over there and see if she's okay.  Just one...second! Score!  Game! Come on. <+++++> Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing- there team. <+++++> Come on, two on one.
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in! <+++++> What, now?
Grazie. <+++++> Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say...
Oh, just look at her... <+++++> Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...
Oh, you're right. <+++++> ...and I really think it should be me.
Hey. <+++++> You all right?
Ooh, I've been better... <+++++> Come here.  Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
Oh, Ross... <+++++> What?
I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy. <+++++> Huh.
Oh Ross, you're so great! <+++++> Ohhhh
Yep! <+++++> See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want <+++++> Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one. <+++++> What?
What? <+++++> I-I'm, I'm having a boy?
Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy. <+++++> Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy!  Huh, am I having a boy?
Yes, you're having a boy! <+++++> I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
What is it? <+++++> I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
We already knew that! <+++++> I'm having a son. Um...
The exclamation point in the title scares me.  Y'know, it's not just Freud , it's Freud! <+++++> Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
Ross, ten o'clock. <+++++> Is it? Feels like two.
No, ten o'clock. <+++++> What?
There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock! <+++++> Oh. Hel-lo!
Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here. <+++++> He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
Y'think? <+++++> Yeah!
Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue... <+++++> C'mon! C'mon!
Chandler? <+++++> Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Whadja think? <+++++> ...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head. <+++++> Saw your head. Saw your head.
Hey, kids. <+++++> Hey.
My husband. <+++++> Ooooohhh.
Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend. <+++++> What?!
Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy? <+++++> No, of course not!  ...Yeah, yeah, it is.
When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is. <+++++> Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking- <+++++> Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
We're kidding. C'mon, tell us! <+++++> Yeah! C'mon!
Yeah! C'mon! <+++++> Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for. <+++++> Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
Well, whaddya think? <+++++> Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman. <+++++> Uh-oh...
That is so unfair! <+++++> Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!
Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook. <+++++> Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
Why not? <+++++> Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I? <+++++> Monica? You're Mom.
Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there!  That was my agent.  My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie! <+++++> Oh my God! Whoah!
"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!" <+++++> C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me! <+++++> You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
Nope. <+++++> No? What happened, big guy?
"Big guy?" <+++++> It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
I got fired. <+++++> Oh!
Maybe this wasn't your shot. <+++++> Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys. <+++++> Night.
Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. <+++++> She is a kook.
So that 's two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you. <+++++> Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand. <+++++> Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
I was shrieking... like a Marine. <+++++> All right here. Watch me execute the three  'P's of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache.
You broke a little girl 's leg?!! <+++++> I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night.  Where exactly were around ten-ish? <+++++> Well, I 'm gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like?
I 'm gonna get back to retraining. <+++++> All right, see you guys.
Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle. <+++++> Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he 'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal. <+++++> I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he 's gonna double the college money my Grandma left me. <+++++> Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?
The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five. <+++++> Yeah.
So far, I 've sold seventy-five. <+++++> Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able.  How much are the boxes?
Five dollars a box. <+++++> And what is second prize?
A ten speed bike. But, I 'd rather have something my Dad couldn't sell. <+++++> Well, that makes sense.
Could you do me one favor, if it 's not too much trouble? <+++++> Yeah, Sarah, anything.
Yesss? <+++++> Hi, I 'm selling Brown Bird cookies.
You 're no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole. <+++++> No, hi, I 'm, I'm an honorary Brown Bird
What does that mean? <+++++> Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I 'm not invited to sleep-overs.
I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away! <+++++> No, please, please, um, it 's for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.
I 'm pressing, a policeman is on his way. <+++++> Okay, okay! I 'm going. I'm going.
I can still see you! <+++++> All right!!
All right, I 'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's. <+++++> Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I 'm trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I'm putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?
Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities? <+++++> No, but ah, there 's coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.
No, but ah, there 's coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night. <+++++> Mon?
All right, I 'll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that's it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds.  Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all? <+++++> Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y'know I 'm sure that's not gonna happen this time, why don't I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph's.
No. <+++++> Oh, come on, now you know you want  'em.
Don 't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this. <+++++> I 'll tell you what Mon, I'll give you the first box for free.
Oh God! I gotta go! <+++++> Come on! All the cool kids are eating  'em!
Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures? <+++++> Ah, we 're out. I sold them all.
What? <+++++> Monica, I 'm cutting you off.
No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it 's no big deal, all right, I'm-I'm cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes! <+++++> Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.
So, how many have you sold so far? <+++++> Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
Oh my God, how did you do that? <+++++> Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as  'Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, 'the munchies.' So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me
Okay, stop what you 're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers..... <+++++> Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?

I don 't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!! <+++++> Sweetie, calm down, it 's gonna be okay.
And now for the great news. <+++++> What, that wasn 't the great news?
I 'm not gonna tell you! You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg. <+++++> Hey now! That was an accident, okay.
You 're a big scrud. <+++++> What 's a scrud?
Why don 't you look in the mirror, scrud. <+++++> I don 't have too. I can just look at you.
All right girls, and man. Let 's see your final tallies.  Ohhhh, Debbie,  321 boxes of cookies,  Very nice. <+++++> Not nice enough.
Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good. <+++++> Good for a scrud.
Oh, yes Elizabeth. Ah, 871. <+++++> That 's crap!! Sister Brown Bird.  Good going.
Who 's next? <+++++> Hi there!
Hi. And batting for Sarah, Ross Geller, 872. Although, it looks like you bought an awful lot of cookies yourself. <+++++> Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross. <+++++> Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
Oh, I blew it. I wouldn 't of even hired me. <+++++> Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you 're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job.  That's not how that was supposed to come out.
I can 't! It's too late! Terry already hired that girl over there.  Look at her, she's even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin....  swans. <+++++> That word was swans.
Should I tell her I ordered tea? <+++++> No.
Really Mr. Geller, you don 't have to do this. <+++++> Oh come on! Here we go!  Stand by for mission countdown!
I 'm an alien. I'm an alien. <+++++> Oh no! An asteroid!

Hey!! <+++++> There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi  What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?
He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret. <+++++> Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?
This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it? <+++++> You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.
You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I. <+++++> Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck?  No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder?
Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes. <+++++> And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?
Noo. <+++++> You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.
Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side! <+++++> Where there is no fear of commitment.
G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play? <+++++> Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah. <+++++> You'll never get me, Joe!!!

Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time. <+++++> What are you talking about?
The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag. <+++++> Okay, you are totally making this up.
How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea. <+++++> Oh God.
Oh please God, let there be a song. <+++++> There was no song.  There was no song!
' I am Bea. ' <+++++> Okay.
' I drink tea. ' <+++++> Okay, that's, that's enough.

Look at you. All jealous. <+++++> Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, she 's more.. y'know, and you're more
Hi, sweetie! <+++++> Hello.
Hi, Ross. <+++++> Yeah, huh.
I 've got some bad news. <+++++> What?
I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here. <+++++> Come on sweetie! You 've had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?
Actually, it 's kinda my fault. I-I quit today. <+++++> But work comes first!  Oh hey, but that 's sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?
Nooo, he 's leaving for a better job. <+++++> Oh well that 's great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh?  Good bye.
Okay, then. <+++++> Okay.
Funny book? <+++++> Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying  'I'll see you Saturday.'
Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn 't mind. <+++++> Oh, no, no, no, it 's-it's not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....
Oh, please tell me it 's not because I'm going with Mark. <+++++> Oh, well...
Oh my God!!! Ross!! <+++++> Well, I 'm sorry, but ah, look if you're not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?
Because, he 's my friend. <+++++> Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...
Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark? <+++++> Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
I don 't know, you thought 'See you Saturday' was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me. <+++++> Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
Really!? <+++++> Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.
Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me.  What? <+++++> What should I wear, now I 'm all nervous.
We 're beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink.... <+++++> I 'm really glad we came.  You're so pretty. I love you.
Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father 's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks! <+++++> Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he 's 'Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!' <+++++> First of all it 's Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn't fly.
Okay, see now, what I just heard <+++++> Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.
Oh, that is so... <+++++> No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island.
Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn 't go with Mark? <+++++> No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don 't know, I feel like lately, I feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it's dumb, but I hate that I'm not a part of it.
It 's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean?  I mean it's like, I-I-I like that you're not involved in that part of my life. <+++++> That 's a little clearer.
Honey see, it doesn 't mean that I don't love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it's-it's for me y'know, I'm out there, on my own, and I'm doing it and it's scary but I love it, because it's mine. I, but, I mean is that okay? <+++++> Sure, I-I-I...
The doctor. <+++++> Is everything okay?
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. <+++++> Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that- that... that's not why we bought the ticket.
Well, she has issues. <+++++> Does she.
He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! <+++++> Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?
Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? <+++++> No. No.
Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! <+++++> Okay, okay, yes, it is.  How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.
Okay, okay, yes, it is.  How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. <+++++> Hi.
So. <+++++> You look great. I, uh... I hate that.
Sorry. You look good too. <+++++> Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh...
A lesbian? <+++++> Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?
Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- <+++++> Why- why are you here, Carol?
I'm pregnant. <+++++> Pregnant?!
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! <+++++> Eeaagh!
Boys? We're going in. <+++++> .....Hi.
Wow. That is not a happy hi. <+++++> Carol's pregnant.
W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... <+++++> Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.
Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? <+++++> Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.
I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. <+++++> Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
So what are you gonna do? <+++++> I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
Mmmm! <+++++> I- I think they're great! I, I really do.
They all had a thing for him. <+++++> Aw, Mom...
Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? <+++++> Yeah.
So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories?  No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? <+++++> Okay! Okay.  Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
Your folks are really that bad, huh? <+++++> Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.
Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could-  -I'd want yours. <+++++> Must pee.
The lights, please.. <+++++> ...How long was I in there?
I'm just cleaning up. <+++++> D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! <+++++> Anyway.. um..  So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
Oh.. a little.. <+++++> Mm-hmm..
A lot. <+++++> Mm.
So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? <+++++> Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...
Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? <+++++> Got me.
Remember when we were in high school together? <+++++> Yeah.
I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it?  ..Ross? <+++++> Yes, yes!
Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. <+++++> Me either...
Ross, you remember Susan. <+++++> How could I forget?
Ross. <+++++> Hello, Susan.  Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?
Dr. Oberman. <+++++> ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-
She. <+++++> -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?
Yes, and she's very supportive. <+++++> Okay, that's great.  No, I'm- Oh.
Thanks. <+++++> Quack, quack..
Give me a 'for instance'. <+++++> Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?
Marlon- <+++++> Marlon?!
-if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. <+++++> ...As in Mouse?
As in my grandmother. <+++++> Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?
We agreed on Minnie. <+++++> 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?
Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? <+++++> Helen Geller? I don't think so.
Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. <+++++> Thank you!
No, I mean it's not Geller. <+++++> What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?
No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. <+++++> Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?
It's my baby too. <+++++> Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.
All right, you two, stop it! <+++++> No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.
Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. <+++++> Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.
Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! <+++++> My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-
Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea? <+++++> Yeah. Yeah. A little.
Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing.  Uh, lie back.. <+++++> You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.
You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. <+++++> Oh my God.
Monica and Rachel's apartment, everyone is watching the tape of the sonogram. <+++++> Well? Isn't that amazing?
You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. <+++++> Then don't do that, alright?
Okay! <+++++> Monica. Whaddya think?
Mm-hmm. <+++++> Wh- are you welling up?
No. <+++++> You are, you're welling up.
Am not! <+++++> You're gonna be an aunt.
No, yeah, I've done that. <+++++> And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.
Let's not do that any more. <+++++> Hey guys! Hey!
It's mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like "yeah, right, well what else is new?" <+++++> Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, I've got to go. I've got Lamaze class.
So, is this just gonna be you and Carol? <+++++> No, Susan's gonna be there too. We've got dads, we've got lesbians, the whole parenting team.
Well, isn't, isn't that gonna be weird? <+++++> No, no.  I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I'm pretty comfortable with the whole situation.
Ross, that's my jacket. <+++++> I know.
Good for you. Alrighty, next? <+++++> Hi, um, I'm err,  I'm Ross Geller, and err ah...  ..that's, that's my boy in there, and uh,  this is Carol Willick, and this... is Susan Bunch. Susan is um Carol's, just, com...  ..who's next?
I'm sorry, I didn't get... Susan is? <+++++> Susan is Carol's, Carol's, Carol's, friend...
Life partner. <+++++> Like buddies.
Like lovers. <+++++> You know how close women can get.
Susan and I live together. <+++++> Although I was married to her.
Carol, not me. <+++++> Err, right.
It's a little complicated. <+++++> A little.
But we're fine. <+++++> Absolutely.  So, twins... hah! That's like two births.  Ouch.
It's not just that she's cute, okay. It's just that... she's really really cute. <+++++> It doesn't matter. You don't dip your pen in the company ink.
Ross, your little creature's got the remote again. <+++++> Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...
Great. <+++++> Relax, I'll fix it.
Cool... "Urkel" in Spanish is "Urkel." <+++++> How did he do this?
Cool, thanks. <+++++> You okay?
Yeah I'm fine. <+++++> You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
Sorry. <+++++> Hi. Sorry I'm late. Where's, where's Carol?
Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. I'll get the information. <+++++> No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know what's going on.
Alrighty. We're gonna start with some basic third stage breathing exercises, so Mummies, why don't you get on your back? And... coaches, you should be supporting Mummy's head. <+++++> What? What? What?
I am supposed to be the mommy? <+++++> Okay, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time.
Look, I don't see why I should have to miss out on the coaching training just because I'm a woman. <+++++> I see. So what do you propose to do?
I will flip you for it. <+++++> Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!
Lights please? And that's having a baby. Next week is our final class. <+++++> Susan, go deep.
What that woman... did. I am not doin ' that. It's just gonna have to stay in, that's all, everything will be the same, it'll just stay in. <+++++> Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everything's gonna be alright.
This is just occurring to you? <+++++> I always knew I was havin' a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me.
Oh, you're gonna be great! <+++++> Aw, how can you say that? I can't even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?
Yeah. Okay. <+++++> No, come on, he doesn't know this stuff. If he knew how you felt.
No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people still die. And, you can put candy in it. <+++++> Hey!
Licorice? <+++++> Sure!  Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year.
Are you gonna dress up as Santa? <+++++> Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.
You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe. <+++++> Hmm.
No. <+++++> Well, I do, so let's...  So, Ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?
Christmas. <+++++> Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?
Christmas eve. <+++++> Yes, but also  Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
Santa has reindeers that can fly! <+++++> Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
Jingle bells, jingle bells... <+++++> Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh  Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer... <+++++> Okay, it's not a contest.
When is Santa coming? <+++++> Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?
No Santa? Was I bad? <+++++> No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.
Santa's mad at me. <+++++> No, hey-hey, come on,  Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!
So Santa's coming? <+++++> Yes! Santa's coming!
Hello, Sir. You're here to return those pants? <+++++> No, these are my pants.
Oh. Okay! How can I help you? <+++++> Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?
Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man. <+++++> Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I uh, you gotta have something.
What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo? <+++++> Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
Texas? <+++++> That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben.  Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.
Wow! Thanks! <+++++> You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!
Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish. <+++++> You are? Me, too!
Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert? <+++++> You wanna wander in the hall?  Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
Cool! <+++++> Yeah!
Hey! <+++++> What are you doing here, Santa?
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird turtle-man? <+++++> I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work! <+++++> Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.
Why? <+++++> Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you 're wrecking it.
But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly. <+++++> I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.
Then it's okay! <+++++> Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!
No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa! <+++++> Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
Okay, Santa! <+++++> All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.
Eight whole days. <+++++> That 's right, and that's why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.
Awesome! <+++++> Yeah?
My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt. <+++++> The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it 's time to light the Hanukkah candles!
Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny 's funeral in here. <+++++> Come on, come on, we 're-we're-we're lighting the candles!
It 's your mommy. It's your mommy. <+++++> Ohhhh
Well that was umm Okay. <+++++> It wasn 't the best.
Wh-what are we gonna tell him? <+++++> Well, the lighting was okay.
And I have costumes. <+++++> Oh great! That means I 'm stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there  and you were sittin' right here! Whoa!"
Did you not understand the story? <+++++> Hey!
Ross! <+++++> Oh, nothin ' much. Just trying to figure out what I'm gonna do for dinner.
Huh. <+++++> Hey -Ooh! What's-what's that, dinner stuff? You making dinner?
No!  Shhh! <+++++> What you got over there? Tacos?
No! No. They 're umm They're just uh ground beef smileys. <+++++> Uhh, those are tacos.
Excuse me Mr. Mexico. <+++++> Eh, either way I 'll pass.  I still can't eat those.  What's so funny?!
I 'm not laughing. <+++++> You told her!
Nancy Thompson 's getting fired! <+++++> Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It 's not like I choose to do it! It's not like-It's not like I said, "Umm, what would make this ride more fun?! "
You 're right. I mean I'm sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you! <+++++> How could you tell her?!
I had too okay?! We 're getting married! Married couples can't keep secrets from one another! <+++++> Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
What happened in Atlantic City?! <+++++> Well, Chandler and I are in a bar
Did you not hear me say,  "Du-ude?!" <+++++> And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he- he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you 're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls.
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy. <+++++> Oh Mon, I laughed so hard
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again? <+++++> Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers! <+++++> All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!
Oh my God! <+++++> Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!
I-I already told him everything!  You shush!! <+++++> Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she 'd made.
Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls! <+++++> Monica couldn 't tell time 'til she was 13!
Ohh, I 'm sorry I couldn't think of anymore for Ross! <+++++> Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!
That was you! <+++++> Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
Y 'know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue. <+++++> And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!
Ohh, absolutely. <+++++> And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.
Yeah, definitely! <+++++> Okay,  if you 'll excuse me, I-I'm gonna go hang out with some people who don't know the Space Mountain story.
Then, I 'd steer clear of Phoebe. <+++++> Man!
Hey! <+++++> Hey-yeah.  Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please?  Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!
Here's your scone. <+++++> Oh, thanks Gunther.  STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!
Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  You'll get your turn! <+++++> Hey Pheebs, what's going on?
Nothing!   This is not over! <+++++> No! No! No!
What?! <+++++> I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in  Actually, thanks!
All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies? <+++++> Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
Really? <+++++> Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff. <+++++> That's okay, Joe.
All right, let's go Pheebs. <+++++> Oh God!
Oh my God!  Where the hell have you been?!! <+++++> Just, y'know out.
What were you doing? <+++++> I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
He hooked up! He hooked up with someone. <+++++> Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!
Oh! Okay!  You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me! <+++++> Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say
You two will have very hairy children. <+++++> Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind. <+++++> Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids.
Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head! <+++++> I am gonna see her again.
Ohhh. <+++++> Hey guys!
Yeah! <+++++> Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice!
Are you serious?! <+++++> Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours.  It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
Here you go. <+++++> Thanks!
Actually, I should get going. <+++++> Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right?
Yes! Yes! You did! <+++++> Oh
What is wrong now?! <+++++> This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then
I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job! And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee -ahh!! Ross, we need to talk. <+++++> Okay. Sometimes I feel
No-no-no, no. I'm going to talk. I believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun. <+++++> Huh?
You're a very sweet person Ross, umm, unfortunately I don't think I can take another second of you whining!! <+++++> Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm too whiney?  So you're saying, I've become so whiney that I annoy you , Janice.
Well yeah!! <+++++> OH MY GOD!!
Are you gonna be okay? <+++++> I am now.
Okay. <+++++> I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice.  What you're-you're not mad?
Why would I be mad? <+++++> Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex- girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.
I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you. <+++++> Okay.
I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free! <+++++> All right.
Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour.  That didn't happen, I made that up! <+++++> Hey!
Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here. <+++++> How come? Everybody else does.
What is that? <+++++> Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.
This is all of your things. <+++++> Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's -Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.
So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale. <+++++> Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
Hey, Ross, you're okay with that? <+++++> Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.
Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme? <+++++> After what I did? Can you blame her?
You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli. <+++++> No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden.  No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye.
What's the matter Ross? <+++++> Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!
Why? <+++++> Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
So you're really okay with this? <+++++> Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!
Okay, what is in here? Rocks? <+++++> No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
So, rocks. <+++++> I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.
Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little? <+++++> I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this? <+++++> Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice
You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?! <+++++> Why?
It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy. <+++++> What's going on?
Yes! Yes! Unreasonable! <+++++> Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!
Are you still mad at us? <+++++> Yep.
Oh good! Because we have an  "I'm sorry" song. <+++++> Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song! <+++++> Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.
Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner. <+++++> Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today. <+++++> You do, huh?
Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air.  Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone <+++++> What are you talking about?
Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room. <+++++> No! Why?
Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really I don't mind. <+++++> Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
I'll get it.  Hello.  Hi Emily!  Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second. <+++++> Hey!  Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner.  Uh, yeah, sure uh hold on.  She wants to say hi.  Hold on.
Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now. <+++++> Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here!
Oh yeah, there-there she is! <+++++> Yeah, yeah, she's here.
Ross, take me off speakerphone. <+++++> Hi.
How can you do this too me?! I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear! <+++++> Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?
You obviously can't keep away from her. <+++++> Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with.
I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time. <+++++> Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.
You're right. <+++++> So, can you trust me?
You can totally tell! Here look, watch me.  Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown.  Smile! <+++++> Well, I guess that's it.
What happened? What happened? <+++++> My marriage is over.
Ross, honey, is there anything we can do? <+++++> Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
Hey! <+++++> Emily's cousin kicked me out!
Why? <+++++> Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease? <+++++> Who needs a lease when it's family!
Yeah. <+++++> You got it.
Okay. <+++++> Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.
Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad. <+++++> What?
Ross? <+++++> Hey roomies!
Love what you've done with the place. <+++++> Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
Oh yeah! <+++++> Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out.  We will, we will, call you back!
Hey, all right! <+++++> Pretty cool, huh?
YES!! <+++++> Uh fellas,
Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings? <+++++> I'll take sports.
Mine! <+++++> All right. Uhh, international.
Oh that's mine too!  I'm Italian! <+++++> Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.
Not even on page 7? <+++++> Oh yeah! You're -hey, you're right! Here's an affordable place,  two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!
What about that circled one? <+++++> Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.
Hey, let's go look at it! <+++++> Okay, let's go.
There we go! <+++++> Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.
Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place. <+++++> I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
Yeah. <+++++> So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?
Oh, it's perfect! <+++++> How about you?
It's a kitchen slash bathroom. <+++++> All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
Hey! <+++++> Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application.
You're kidding, no! <+++++> Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So
But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies! <+++++> Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space.
Yeah! <+++++> Are you guys sure about this?
Yes! Ross, you have to stay! <+++++> All right.
All right, buddy! <+++++> So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just .
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much? <+++++> Come on, it's fun!
Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth. <+++++> Hey.
Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat! <+++++> Sorry.
And the bunny got away. <+++++> This would be the place where you explain the hat.
All right. <+++++> Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
What? <+++++> Is everything okay?
Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside. <+++++> Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died.
What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book! <+++++> Your make-up!
All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you. <+++++> What's the part, Anti-man?
Hi sweetie! <+++++> Hey, how are you holding up?
What?! What honey? <+++++> What happened?
Uh-huh. <+++++> Wh-what did he say?!
Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out <+++++> Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger!  I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like,  "Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!"  I kinda scared myself.
You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that. <+++++> Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
Hi. <+++++> Hey!
Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me. <+++++> What kind of problem?
Oh my God! <+++++> Nooooo!
Not gonna find any clothes in there! <+++++> Hey, you guys!
Hi. <+++++> Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?
Umh... Kurts Baley? <+++++> Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract  Well, why are you laughing?
So you're up for keynote speaker! Who's making the decisions? <+++++> Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today.
He's a pretty tough guy to impress. <+++++> Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him.
Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya? <+++++> Tsz... NO! .
Hey guys! <+++++> Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.
I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick. <+++++> It's in Barbados.
Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample. <+++++> So-so what did the doctor say?
ah-ha! <+++++> How do you feel about all this?
Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it! <+++++> What?
What? <+++++> What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!
Mmm-mm. <+++++> I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash.  So-so what I am saying is - is is that  is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!

I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles! <+++++> Oh, that's not what you want...
Hello? <+++++> Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?
No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up? <+++++> I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
Oh! How's it going? <+++++> It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!
What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda! <+++++> Barbados.
Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job! <+++++> What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.
Well, just wake him up! <+++++> I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!
How about those three pointers? <+++++> Amazing!
Hey look-look, Phoebe 's talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy. <+++++> Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.
He is! But he 's getting divorced-Ross! Maybe you know him. <+++++> It 's not a club.
Phoebe, if this guy 's going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him? <+++++> Hey, divorced men are not bad men!
Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife. <+++++> Soon he 'll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.
Why? Is he? He is! Isn 't he? He's dating that slut in marketing! <+++++> Maybe I should open a divorced men 's club.
Dude that is so sad. <+++++> I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
Okay, I know. Hold on.  Hey Ross? <+++++> Yeah?
Yeah, umm that 's Whitney , Kyle's ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y'know divert her so that we can slip out? <+++++> What?! No!
Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals. <+++++> Look, I don 't think so Pheebs.  All right, I'll do it. But just because you're a friend.
Hi Ginger. <+++++> All right! I want my key back!
I don 't have it! <+++++> It 's right there!
Ugh, okay Sherlock! <+++++> Look, I 'm sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs.
All right, well I just wanted to say thank you though for diverting Kyle 's ex. <+++++> Oh yeah -No-You're welcome. We'll talk about it later.
Okay. <+++++> Hi Whitney.
Hi Ross! You ready for breakfast? <+++++> Yep.  Okay.
Kyle 's ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date her! <+++++> Hi! I 'm sorry, but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night.
Sure. <+++++> Okay.   I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay?
Watching ballroom dancing? <+++++> Yes! That 's where we realized we were both super cool people!
Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her. <+++++> Like what?
Like she 's really mean, and she's over critical, and-and-No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you! <+++++> Okay.
And! She uses sex as a weapon! <+++++> Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I 'll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.
You 're still gonna go out with her?! <+++++> Yeah!
Well, didn 't you just hear what I said?! <+++++> Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex- husband 's gonna say that stuff. Now, if you'll excuse me
Hi. <+++++> Hi.
So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet? <+++++> Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay -and F.Y.I she must've shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was, "I don't give a tiny rat's ass."
Yeah well, maybe she should 've spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom. <+++++> Well, I don 't think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that 's just because I am not emotionally unavailable!
You think he 's emotionally unavailable? <+++++> I think he can be.
Well, maybe he wouldn 't be she didn't bring the office home every night! <+++++> Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year 's Eve 1997. <+++++> I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!
We want the last six years back!! <+++++> So do we!! So do we!!  I 'm sorry you had to see that.
Oh, I 'm sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney? <+++++> Well maybe she wouldn 't have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!
Both of you together? <+++++> Wh-what 's up?
we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So <+++++> Oh just say it Kyle!
Oh right, because you 're so capable of change. <+++++> Y 'know, he hums when he pees!
I do know. <+++++> It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
We 're so sorry. <+++++> That 's all right, we-we don't need you. In fact, hey I'm over it already.
Yeah, we 're gonna go. <+++++> I 'm sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y'know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a little.
Oh. Y 'know, he hums while he does other stuff to. <+++++> Yeah, were better off without them.
And y 'know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club! <+++++> Divorced men 's club.
Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys. <+++++> Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?
Duly noted. <+++++> Thanks.   Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
What are you talking about? <+++++> Cousin Frannie 's wedding, its tomorrow night.
You were invited?! <+++++> No.
Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie 's made some new friends. <+++++> Well l-look okay, it 's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y 'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too. <+++++> Y 'know, she tried to undress me too.
Oh that 's a nickname we were trying out. <+++++> Hey, y 'know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron!
Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex! <+++++> Phoebe he 's right, that is the rule.
Okay, you wore me down. <+++++> Hey Joe, while you 're over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?
Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody 's sale is over?! <+++++> Hey.
Hey. <+++++> So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn 't a mistake. Ahh, there's-there's limited seating in the hall.
Limited seating?!  I am just one tiny person! <+++++> Well yeah, but she doesn 't know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That 's not the reason she's not inviting me! <+++++> Oh what 's the big deal?! I wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y'know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we'll-we'll leave early as a sign of protest.
Joan? <+++++> Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She 's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross 's behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back <+++++> Not broad backed!
Wait a minute, y 'know, you're bringing me! <+++++> What? I can 't cancel on Joan!
Why not?! <+++++> Bec -Did you not hear me?! She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They're wild! Why do you want to come anyway?
Because! She 's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me. <+++++> Okay, all right, I 'll take you. I'll go call Joan.
Used to work with her. Used to! I 'm a relative and I didn't get invited! A blood relative! Blood!! <+++++> Stop saying,  "Blood" to strangers.
Ross, sweetheart! <+++++> Oh, hey Aunt Millie.
Isn 't it a beautiful wedding?! <+++++> Yes, yes it is. It 's uh  Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
Here 's Frannie. Hmm, won't she be happy to see me? <+++++> Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn 't bring you here so you can ambush her.
Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom. <+++++> That bitch!
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?! <+++++> Hi Frannie, congratulations.
I believe you know my husband. <+++++> So it 's really a question of who could you have possibly done.
Oh wait I forgot my wrap. <+++++> What? Oh, okay. Wait here.
Hi sweetie! Are you leaving? <+++++> Well
Give us a kiss. Come on! Come on! <+++++> Why?! Why on the lips?!
That's nice. <+++++> No, no, with him.  I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.
Tampa Bay's got a terrible team. <+++++> Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.
He should take the sack? <+++++> Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.
I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday. <+++++> Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
When's that? <+++++> Tonight.
Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening? <+++++> You take your time.
SURPRISE!!! <+++++> What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.
Was that the cake? <+++++> Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush.
Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses. <+++++> Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools.
Hey, what's going on? <+++++> Oh, we just...
I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say  "get out of my office!" <+++++> Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?
I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash; <+++++> Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, "Oh my god I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?
No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about? <+++++> No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.
'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that? <+++++> Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?
So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg? <+++++> No, we can go to Williamsburg.
Ross, he's got the remote again. <+++++> Good. Maybe he can switch it back.
Good. Maybe he can switch it back. <+++++> Maybe not.
Hey. <+++++> Hey!
Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you? <+++++> Well did you try calling her?
Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father. <+++++> Uh-huh.
Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this. <+++++> Do you have a point?
What's up with the simian? <+++++> It's just a fur ball.
Okay...  ..whose turn is it? <+++++> Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'.
No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'. <+++++> I had a 'K'. Where's where's my 'K'?
You go get that animal outta here. <+++++> No, no you don't understand the animal hospital is way across town he's choking I don't know what else to do.
Excuse me... This hospital is for people! <+++++> Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!
Is he alright? <+++++> Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.
We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.' <+++++> Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.
So, you feel like a dad yet? <+++++> No, why?
Oh, look, he's waking up! <+++++> hey, fella! How you doing?
ÃÂ¡Mira, mira, el viejo desnudo estÃÂ¡ haciendo el hula hoop! <+++++> ÃÂ¡Ewww!
ÃÂ¡Ewww! <+++++> ÃÂ¡Hola, Joey!
Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto. <+++++> ÃÂ¡Lo que sucedio es que no le gusta la tele!
Hi guys! <+++++> Hey, Pheebs! Hi!
Hey, Pheebs! Hi! <+++++> Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?
Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!' <+++++> Ohh. Ouch.
Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm. <+++++> That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
Uh, Ross. <+++++> What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!
That's ridiculous! <+++++> Can I use.. either thumb?
Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me!  Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this! <+++++> Yeah. Yeah, excellent.
It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT- <+++++> Easy.
Hey. Whaddya doing? <+++++> Oh! Oh, God!
Oh! Oh, God! <+++++> What is this?!
And this- is my reward! <+++++> Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
Okay, so this time I won't quit! <+++++> Ohhh! Put it out!
Let's see, today's Monday... Never. <+++++> Oh, come on! Come on!
Let it go, Ross. <+++++> Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
Do you all promise? <+++++> Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside! <+++++> Hey, Pheebs.
Hi. <+++++> Hi, Alan.
C'mon! <+++++> ...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.
Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with? <+++++> Yeah!
Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe! <+++++> ...What shoe?
From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...' <+++++> ...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? <+++++> You know what I like most about him, though?
What? <+++++> The way he makes me feel about myself.
Hi.. how was the game? <+++++> Well..
Alan. <+++++> He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes.. <+++++> What?
Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan. <+++++> Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
Does, um, anyone wanna see? <+++++> Nooo!
Nooo! <+++++> Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair? <+++++> Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
Oh,   "you do, do you"? <+++++> You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
Do you have any respect for your body? <+++++> Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
God, he's good. <+++++> If only he were a woman.
Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too. <+++++> Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
Thanks. <+++++> There y'go.
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now. <+++++> Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?
Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart? <+++++> Hey, I might!
Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb. <+++++> You're kidding. Oh my God.
Okay.. <+++++> Oh! That was Lambchop!
Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan. <+++++> Is there somebody else?
-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you! <+++++> Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were.
I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans. <+++++> Oh, yeah! Right!
Are you guys gonna be okay? <+++++> Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time.
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun. <+++++> Yeah. He could row like a viking.
Hi. <+++++> Mmm.
Mmm. <+++++> So how'd it go?
He said he's really gonna miss you guys. <+++++> You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.
...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes. <+++++> No no no!
No. <+++++> Hey.
Hey. <+++++> What is ah, Rach in her room?
Oh no, she 's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her. <+++++> Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn 't she know it's our anniversary?
All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject.  Call Rachel. <+++++> What 's that on the bottom?
Hello. <+++++> Hey, honey.
Oh, hi. <+++++> Hey, what 's going on?
Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I 've got to get this order in. Honey, I'm so sorry, but it looks like I'm gonna be here all night. <+++++> What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?
No, no, no, I 'm looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And....  What does it matter, what I'm wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor?  Thank you.  We're holding. <+++++> Hi!
Oh!! My God, what are you doing here? <+++++> Well you said you couldn 't go out so....
Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis. <+++++> Yeah, but I got cous-cous!
Honey, honey, I 'm sorry, I know it's our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don't have time to stop. <+++++> Okay, you don 't have to stop, I'm invisible, I'm not here.
I love Mark.  Do you know Mark? <+++++> Yeah!!
Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is not the number for  this store, 038 is Atlanta. And I... <+++++> Pepper?
None for me. <+++++> Okay sorry, whew.
I 'm sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I'm sorry but that's...  Oh my God!! <+++++> Okay, that 's a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
Excuse me, I 'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back, I've got a Schemp in my office.   What are you doing? <+++++> I 'm sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody's off the phone, how 'bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.
Ross you 're not listening to me, I don't have time to stop. <+++++> Come on Rach, you don 't have what, ten minutes?
I don 't have ten minutes!! <+++++> What?  Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don 't! <+++++> Don 't yell at me okay, this is the most I've seen you all week.
Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I 've got a deadline, would you just go home, I'll talk to you later. <+++++> Yeah, but wait...
Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier... <+++++> No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.
I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me. <+++++> For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody 's work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger! <+++++> Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
But I told you, I didn 't have the time! <+++++> Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don 't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend? <+++++> No, but it 'd be nice if you realised, it's just a job!
Just a job! <+++++> Yes.
Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I 'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that... <+++++> No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I 'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore.
Well neither do I! <+++++> Is this about Mark?
Oh my God. <+++++> Okay, it 's not, it's not.
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you 're, you're, you're making this too hard. <+++++> Oh I 'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
I don 't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break. <+++++> Okay, okay, fine, you 're right. Let's ah, let's take a break,  let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something..
Hey, it 's the dinosaur guy.  Hi, Ross. <+++++> Oh, hi Chloe.
So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner. <+++++> Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we 're gonna break-up instead.
So what are you gonna do? <+++++> What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out. <+++++> Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don 't I have to wait a while?
Hello. <+++++> Hi! It 's me.
Hi! Oh, I 'm so glad you called. <+++++> Really? I 've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
Hey, what do you want to drink? <+++++> Who 's that?
Is it okay if I finish the apple juice? <+++++> Is that Mark?
Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance. <+++++> Ah, that 's okay, thanks.
Hey, you don 't have to smile. You just have to dance. <+++++> Look, I don 't feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?
Well, you 're practically dancing already. Why don't you just do it over here? <+++++> Oh, no, no.
Hi Monica! <+++++> Hey Mon!
Oh my God, has she slept at all? <+++++> Nope.
No, it's been three nights in a row. <+++++> Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.
It's some of Richard's hair!  What do I do with this? <+++++> Getting it away from me would be job one.
God, what is wrong with me. <+++++> You need to get some sleep.
There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross? <+++++> Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
Honey, I was wondering.... <+++++> Hmm?
Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform? <+++++> Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.
Hmm. <+++++> I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
You remember not having sex in high school, right? <+++++> Yeah.
Well honey, what about you? <+++++> What?
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things? <+++++> No.
Come on you gotta have one! <+++++> Nope.
Ross, you know what... <+++++> What?
...if you tell me, I might do it. <+++++> Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?
Yeah. <+++++> Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia.
Oooh! <+++++> Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty cool.
No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya! <+++++> Hey!
Hi you guys! <+++++> Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter.
Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon. <+++++> Okay.
I know I do. <+++++> Hi.
Hi. <+++++> Guess what?
What? <+++++> They published my paper.
Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal. <+++++> Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.
Okay, who are you talking to when you do that? <+++++> Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.
Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff. <+++++> That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.
Were both of those Joey? <+++++> Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.
Not even with your best friend. <+++++> Noo!
That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are. <+++++> Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?
Pretty much. <+++++> Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?
Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol. <+++++> I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think.
Uh, huh.  Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away. <+++++> Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
Umm, yeah. <+++++> No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....
Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this? <+++++> Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?
We're not gonna talk about girth are we? <+++++> Nooo!
Yeah, okay. <+++++> Yeah?
Yeah! All right! You go first. <+++++> Okay, okay, I'll go first.
Okay. <+++++> So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing....
Princess Leia in the gold bikini. <+++++> Yes!
I know! <+++++> Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.
Okay. <+++++> Okay.
Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman. <+++++> Hmph.
And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place.... <+++++> With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!
I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know! <+++++> Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?
You said... <+++++> I said ' share ' not ' scare '. Go sit over there! .
Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What? <+++++> No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's
Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me out here. <+++++> I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life.
Hi! <+++++> Hey!
She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us. <+++++> Come on, she's gonna love you guys!
Saraaah. <+++++> Hey!
Hi! <+++++> Hey you guys, I need some fashion advice.
Oh! <+++++> How does this look?
Well, it's a little low... pick up a little...  a little bit more...  a little bit more...  There you go!  Now throw it away! <+++++> C'mon! This looks good!
Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat. <+++++> Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!
Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us, right? <+++++> Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress.
I can see why, nice shirt! <+++++> You're wearing the same shirt.
This place is awesome! <+++++> You know, we should just go, I 'm not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!
Wow! <+++++> Rach, come on, I 'm not gonna wear any of this!  Nothing silver. . Ok? Nothing with hair!  And nothing with padlocks on it! .
Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! . I mean, this is just beautiful! <+++++> Wow, this is really soft . Three hundred and fifty dollars?
Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks! <+++++> Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.
Hey, check this out! It's totally you! <+++++> Wow!
Yeah! <+++++> Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah! Boys will be boys?
What? They will be! <+++++> All right, that 's it, I'm getting out of here.
No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there 's other stuff. Here's a nice shirt, look at these nice pants... <+++++> Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.
Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I 'm... I'm gonna pick up some really good stuff for you. <+++++> Really?
Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she 's gonna go nuts for you. <+++++> So, you 're saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?
I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!! <+++++> Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that. <+++++> Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?
Looks like someone IS the ladies!! <+++++> You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me  I have a date.  See?  ALL eyes on ME!
Wow, this place looks great. <+++++> Oh! You are gonna love it!  and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this.
Me too! <+++++> Here  So this was fun!
So, why are you still wearing it? <+++++> Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date?
Ooh... Not so good. <+++++> Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?
Wait. Really?!  'Cause mine get me out of tickets. <+++++> Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It 's been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.
Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window. <+++++> Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think?  Two days of darts, it 'll be great!
It 'll be great for next weekend. <+++++> No, no, no, this weekend guys!
It 'll be great for next weekend. I mean,  it'll be grrreat. <+++++> What 's going on?
Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel 's sister's cabin. <+++++> So, for the whole weekend?
We 're really sorry, but um, she did ask us first. <+++++> Yeah, that 's okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I 'm alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.
Noo! I 'll stay. He's my brother. <+++++> What a pity stay?
No! We 're gonna have fun. We can make fudge! <+++++> Pity food? Y'know what that 's okay, all right, I don't need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.
Hi! <+++++> Hey.
Hey, what are you doing here? <+++++> Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of MASH and half the hostages coming home?
Ah yeah, but now it 's Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home. <+++++> Where 's Ben?
He 's sleeping. <+++++> Ahh.  Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
Umm, yeah, actually, Susan 's gonna be home any minute, it's kinda an anniversary. <+++++> Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
It 's not that kind of anniversary. <+++++> Ah!  Oh.
Sooo!! Anyway... <+++++> Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great.  'Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
Oh God, Ross I am so sorry. <+++++> Yeah, well.
Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night? <+++++> Oh yeah, I 'd love that.
Oh, great! Me too. <+++++> I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
Ross, thank God. <+++++> Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?
Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don 't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck. <+++++> Oh, now you want a favour?
Yes, please. <+++++> Well, oh, I 'm sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?
Phoebe, hang on a second.  Here, take my car, go pick up your friends. <+++++> No, I 'm not gonna pick them up.
Listen, we both know you 're gonna do it 'cause you're not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car. <+++++> No, Rachel doesn 't want me to....
Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you  'cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don't punish your friends for what Rachel did to you. <+++++> Yeah, you 're right.
Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something.  What?   You slept with someone else?! <+++++> We were on a break!!! Okay!!  We were, we were...,  yeah. Where are you? I 'll find you.
You slept with another woman? <+++++> Oh, you-you 're-you're one to talk.
What is he doing here?! <+++++> He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I 'm stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I've got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.
You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come. <+++++> Excuse me?
It 's horrible. <+++++> Oh please, can 't I come to your special, magical cabin?
Why would you even want to come Ross? You 're a horrible skier. <+++++> Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.
Y'know what, I can handle it, handle 's my middle name. Actually it's the ah, middle part of my first name. <+++++> All right Pheebs, your cab 's ready.
All right, let 's go! <+++++> You 're welcome.
Oh, I 'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else? <+++++> We were on a break!
Y'know Ross why don 't you put that on your answering machine! <+++++> Hey-hey, it 's valid okay? And I'm not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me.
I don 't know. <+++++> That 's what you said last night.
What I said was, was that I understood. Joey 's the one who agreed with you! <+++++> Okay.
No, I think it 's very obvious who's wrong here. <+++++> Obviously not to Joey.
Yeah. <+++++> I can.
Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who 's going with who? <+++++> Look, you guys, you guys should go.  No, I 'm, you, you planned this all out, and I don't want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.
Come on man, you drove all the way up here. <+++++> No, no, really, I 've got to take the car back anyway, I'm spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It's fine, no guilt I promise.
All right, we 'll call you when we get back. <+++++> Okay.
Maybe we can like go to a movie or something. <+++++> Okay.
Or, or the rodeo!! <+++++> That would be great.
I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure. <+++++> I know!
Ugh.  Ross! <+++++> Hi! Sorry I 'm late. Were you sleeping?
Ahh, nooo!! <+++++> Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could,  'cause that's not where you want to skimp.
You 're a genius, Ross. <+++++> Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?
Okay, I 'll pay you tomorrow. <+++++> Okay.
Okay, bye!! <+++++> So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?
Yeah, okay, bye. <+++++> So I 'm gonna take off then!
Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning. <+++++> Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
Hey. <+++++> Aww, is it broken?
Mon? <+++++> Mon?
'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.' <+++++> Wait a minute, look.
What? <+++++> Look, look, look.
What, what, what? <+++++> It's an empty apartment.
Oooh. <+++++> We're all alone in an empty apartment.
Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes  Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything. <+++++> There it is.
Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about.  Hey. <+++++> Hey.
Do I look fat? <+++++> Noo.
Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her.... <+++++> Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?
Nooo! <+++++> And it works both ways.
Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on. <+++++> Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?
That's easy, baggage claim. <+++++> Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers.  Okay, I'm late for work. <+++++> Oh.
All right are you guys gonna come down? <+++++> Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.
Thank you Rachel. <+++++> Bye sweetie.
Bye hon. <+++++> Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.
Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers. <+++++> Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here.  Okay, you're in bed...
Yeah. <+++++> I'm gonna use the cushion.
Yeah. <+++++> Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her  and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.
Okay, the old hug and roll. <+++++> Yep.
Okay, one question. <+++++> Shoot.
Hi! <+++++> Hey, Phoebe.
Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute. <+++++> Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
Hey guys. <+++++> Hey Mon.
Well, your gonna need much bigger jars. <+++++> What are you talking about?
I'm talking about me having a baby. <+++++> What?
Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan. <+++++> Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!
You mean there's more than one of us. <+++++> Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna.....
You're gonna what? <+++++> I'm gonna tell Mom.
Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy. <+++++> Crazy.
What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something.... <+++++> Oh, it's not the ideal way...
Hellooo! <+++++> Hey.
Hey. <+++++> How's the maniac?
Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything. <+++++> You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
Yeah. <+++++> Hello.
Hello. <+++++> Hey.  Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?
Sure. What's up? <+++++> Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk!
Cappuccino. <+++++> Grazie.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Never mind. But it was going to be really good. <+++++> What's going on?
So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor. <+++++> That's great!
So.... I quit. <+++++> Why?
Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream. <+++++> Ah, the lesser-known  "I don't have a dream" speech.
Ooh! I know what you could make!  I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff?  You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know. <+++++> Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free. <+++++> OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross. <+++++> Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
So what are you guys going to do? <+++++> Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe...  huh-huh? <+++++> Well, I don't know....  huh-huh.... but I'm hoping  huh-huh.
I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my... <+++++> Alright...
Talk to me. <+++++> OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
No no no. Talk... dirty. <+++++> Wha... what, here?
Yes... <+++++> Ah....
Say something..... hot. <+++++> Er.... um.....
What? <+++++> Um... uh.... vulva.
Vulva? <+++++> Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times?? <+++++> Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me. <+++++> Please be kidding.
Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now. <+++++> OK.  I'm in my apartment...
....yeah... what else? <+++++> That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation.
Alright, look, I'll start, OK? <+++++> Joey, please.
Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look!  Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now. <+++++> Wow.
Alright, now you say something. <+++++> I... ahem... I really don't think so.
Come on! You like this woman, right? <+++++> Yeah.
You want to see her again, right? <+++++> Sure.
Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt! <+++++> OK, turn around.  I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead. <+++++> Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
There you go! Keep going. Keep going! <+++++> I, er...
I, er... <+++++> I want to take my tongue... and...
I want to take my tongue... and... <+++++> ....and....
Say it... say it! <+++++> ...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
....with?? <+++++> Funny story!
You don't want to work for a guy like that. <+++++> Yeah!
I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it. <+++++> Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.
So, er... how did it go with Celia? <+++++> Oh, I was unbelievable.
All right, Ross! <+++++> I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.
Whoa! And the...  huh-huh? <+++++> Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...
You cuddled. <+++++> Yeah, which was nice.
Are you okay, sweetie? <+++++> I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...
Let me get you some coffee. <+++++> Thanks.
Ooh! Oh! <+++++> No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?
Fine! <+++++> I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.
No you don't. <+++++> No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!
And you never knew she was a lesbian... <+++++> No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud? <+++++> I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.
Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3 <+++++> Sorry.
Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones! <+++++> I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
Hi, sure! <+++++> Hi.
Tuna or egg salad? <+++++> I'll have whatever Christine is having.
I say push her down the stairs. <+++++> 
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy! <+++++> You can see where he'd have trouble.
Who's Paul? <+++++> Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?
Maybe. Joey <+++++> He finally asked you out?
Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay? <+++++> That'd be good...
Really? <+++++> No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!
Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul. <+++++> Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah... <+++++> A wandering?
Shut up, Joey! <+++++> So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing! <+++++> Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your-  -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. <+++++> Okay, sure.
All finished! <+++++> This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.
Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get? <+++++> You guys.
You must stop! <+++++> That only took me an hour.
Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. <+++++> You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon! <+++++> I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
Right. <+++++> Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?
Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that? <+++++> I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
Guess what? <+++++> You got a job?
You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel. <+++++> The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
I don't think so. <+++++> Come on, you made coffee!
Come on, you made coffee! <+++++> C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...
 <+++++> Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..
Well, that's it  You gonna crash on the couch? <+++++> No. No, I gotta go home sometime.
You be okay? <+++++> Yeah.
That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody. <+++++> Goodnight.
Goodnight. <+++++> Mmm.  Oh, no-
Sorry- <+++++> No no no, go-
No, you have it, really, I don't want it- <+++++> Split it?
Okay. <+++++> Okay.  You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
I knew. <+++++> You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
I did. <+++++> Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
Yeah, maybe... <+++++> Okay... okay, maybe I will...
Goodnight. <+++++> Goodnight.
See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you? <+++++> I just grabbed a spoon.
Oh, was I doing it again? <+++++> Yes!
Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya. <+++++> There's an image.
I'm just serving it. <+++++> Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.
Come on! Why are we here?! <+++++> Okay, okay take a guess.
The hot chicks? <+++++> Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y 'know-y'know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It's here! Yeah, it's right-it's right down here! In the biggest library in the university!
Wow that 's actually pretty cool. <+++++> Oh umm, there 's also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina.  What is that?
I 'm sorry? <+++++> My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin ' babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!
Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good? <+++++> Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.
Yeah, there was. It was -there the corner of the library where- where all these dusty books that nobody ever read-Yes, there was. <+++++> Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it 's like uh-a thing!
Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall? <+++++> Oh for cryin ' out loud!
Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift. <+++++> No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!
How can I help you? <+++++> Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
We are aware of the problem you are referring too.  But as far as increasing security, I 'm afraid the library is very understaffed. I, I can't help you. <+++++> Well, fine. Fine! If-if I 'm the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I'll go up there and defend it myself!  And don't you follow me!
Yeah, we were we were just looking around. <+++++> Oh-oh, you 're-you're fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for, hmm? Perhaps,  perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings on the Smiledon Californicus?
Uhh . <+++++> Ah Ah Get out of here!  Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion's views on evolution?
Uh, actually I find Marion 's views far to progressionist. <+++++> I find Marion 's views far to progressionist.
I 'm sorry, who are you? <+++++> I 'm a professor here uh, Ross Geller.
Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It 's uh-Wait!  Did you write this? <+++++> Yes! You 're the person who checked out my book?!
Y 'know, you look nothing like I would've thought. You're you're so young. <+++++> Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.
Couldn 't I just say, "This is Ross?" <+++++> Sure, do whatever you want.
Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section <+++++> Yeah?
Look at this. <+++++> Oh, it looks like mom and dad 's house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is Oh my God!!
I can 't believe mom and dad are selling the house! <+++++> I can 't believe they-they didn't even tell us!
I can 't believe I still don't know what happened to the window in the attic! <+++++> Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper!  Yes we 're surprised!  Who did you leave a message with?
Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it 's time the velvet ropes came down. <+++++> They kept your room for a while.
Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria 's Secret catalogues, not a gym! <+++++> Come on, you know they love you.
As much as they love you? <+++++> I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It 's not my fault.
Hey. <+++++> Hey.
Ugh, I hate this year! <+++++> What 's wrong with this year?
Oh that 's right! <+++++> Hey, y 'know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y 'know, I probably wouldn't have to say spank as much. <+++++> What?
I 'm here! <+++++> Hey!
Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work. <+++++> Dad, we-we can 't believe you're selling the house.
Well, it 's time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling. <+++++> Let 's grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
I used to love to play restaurant. <+++++> Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
So, I think you 're boxes are over here. <+++++> Wow! Great!  Wait, dad who-who 's cigarettes are these?
I don 't know. They-they must be your mother's, but please, please don't ask her. I'll throw these away. <+++++> Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad,  Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym  Oooh, my rock polisher!
Oh look, look there 's your old makeup kit! <+++++> It 's a clown kit! Clown kit!
Well, the white seems to be untouched.  Uh-oh. <+++++> What?
Y 'know how the garage floods every Spring? <+++++> How are you ever going to sell this place?
I think I accidentally used Monica 's boxes to keep the water away from the Porsche. <+++++> Oh no. Dad! Dad! What  Oh God everything's ruined! Dad, she's gonna be crushed!
You don 't secretly smoke do you? <+++++> No!
Well, she 'll understand right? It's not like I did it on purpose. <+++++> Dad that won 't matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
Oh my God, does she really thinks that? <+++++> Well, can you blame her?
Well I don 't know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could <+++++> Dad, dad I don 't want to hear about it.
Really? <+++++> Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we 're gonna give her some! Okay, grab grab some empty boxes. Okay? We'll-we'll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we'll-we'll put 'em in their.
Great! <+++++> Like uh y 'know like this! This!  She-she could've made this!
Sure! <+++++> Right? And this!  She-she could 've won this!
This could 've been hers! <+++++> Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?
Hey guys! Hey! <+++++> Hey.
That 's a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three days! <+++++> Yeah! Yeah!  Oh, this will make a great memory.
Okay. So, which boxes are mine? <+++++> Well, these. These are yours right here.
Okay.  Oh! A coloring book! <+++++> Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines. <+++++> Nu-uh!
Wow! Look at this!  I can 't believe I even fit into this shirt!   Oh, this is yours. <+++++> Oh, I don 't know how that got in there.
This isn 't mine.  Hey, this isn't, this isn't my stuff! Ugh, Ross!  These are your boxes! Where are my boxes? <+++++> Umm, your boxes are umm
What? <+++++> Dad?
Oh, this terrible! Eve rything is destroyed! Look at this.  It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don't even know what it is! Ohh, it's still soft.  What do you think this is? <+++++> All right. I think it was a mouse.
What?! <+++++> What?!!!
Wait, you 're giving me your Porsche , you're kidding me right?! <+++++> Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
All right! <+++++> Well, what about me?! I 'm a medical marvel!!
Oh Emma. This is going to be your first Thanksgiving. What are you thankful for? Mommy's bobbies. <+++++> A lot of people are thankful for those.
It's your favorite sister. <+++++> Jill?
Its a girl? <+++++> Hey Amy.
Not really. But you are much cuter then that geeky guy she used to date. <+++++> That was me.
No, he was this creepy guy from high school who had this huge crush on her since like the ninth grade. <+++++> Still me.
No, I'm not talking about you.  <to Rachel> It was your fat <+++++> Amy. I'm going to save you some time, ok. <spins finger around in circle> All me.
Hello? Yeah, um. Hang on one sec.  <to Ross and Rachel> Can I take this upstairs? <+++++> Sure, we don't live there but...
God she is unbelievable. <+++++> I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.
My boyfriend canceled on me. I mean.. I I finally find a real relationship. I mean, someone that I can spend this day with and then his wife comes back into town. I swear, its almost not worth dating married guys. <+++++> Don't say that.
Oh Amy, don't cry Amy. <+++++> Sure, you want to go upstairs?
Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving. <+++++> You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.
Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I would like them to bond. <+++++> Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.
Hap.. Hap.. Happy Thanksgiving. <+++++> Hi.
Hi. <+++++> Hi.
Oh I was just thinking. You know what would be incredible? If you guys died. <+++++> Thank you Amy.
PHOE-BE. <+++++> Why does she keep making that noise?
Well who would? <+++++> Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want Monica and Chandler.
Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful. <+++++> Woah. Woah... <nearly really drops the plate and more seriously> Woah.
Actually what? <+++++> well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma would go to my parents.
So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma? <+++++> No,  that that is not what we're saying.
Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. you're more the fun parent. <+++++> Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.
Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable? <+++++> No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you're strongest when.. when you're together.
Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die  <knocks on table>  she'd have to give her up. <+++++> Sure, Monica would have to give her up.
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress. <+++++> Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.
I did the first time! Oh. Oh..  <gets up and walks into the kitchen> And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving Emily to you. <+++++> Emma.
You bitch. You just think you're so perfect. With your new baby and your, your small apartment.  <directs this to Ross who in turns throws the towel in his hand down on the table> Well let me tell you something. Your baby isn't even that cute. <+++++> Too far, Amy. Too far.
Alright. Thats it!  <Pushes Amy back> <+++++> Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't time!
By the way, that fight was totally arousing. <+++++> Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.
Oh yeah? Well thanks. <+++++> So, so now do I get Joey?
It sounds interesting! <+++++> Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett...
You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise! <+++++> What? How come that you don't have to go!
Hey! <+++++> Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.
Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs. <+++++> There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.
What's so bad about that? <+++++> It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.
 <+++++> These aren't suede.
No. <+++++> Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller.
Oh, hi. I'm professor Wealer. <+++++> Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice.
It's a... It's good to meet you! Thank you so much for taking the time out to show me around. <+++++> Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.
And, by the way, I really enjoyed your paper on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis. <+++++> Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute.
Twenty bucks says they're married within the month. <+++++> We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover.
Oh, ah, isn't there another professor that is supposed to come with us? <+++++> I don't think so.
I'm pretty sure, professor Spafford from Cornell? <+++++> Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is  "if you can't come on time, then don't come at all".  An option that many of my students use.  Shall we?
You don't think we should wait for him? <+++++> You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok?
Professor Geller? <+++++> Oh, damn it!
And then my wife and I went on a cruise to the Galapagos. There was a sea food buffet you wouldn't believe. There were clams, and mussels, and oysters, and cracked crab, and snow crab, and king crab. It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish. <+++++> So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?
And that's not all I'm allergic to. <+++++> Oh, it's not over!
I'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts... <+++++> So basically all nuts?
Oh my God!! <+++++> I've lost the will to live.
Let's ditch him! <+++++> What?
Come on, he's still in the bathroom! I'm begging you! <+++++> Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm...  When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll...
Hi! <+++++> Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll take this. Excuse me. <+++++> Ranion's theory of species variegation?
So, did you two have fun? <+++++> Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny...
Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play. <+++++> Really? Wh-what's wrong?
... Ok, who is this? <+++++> I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.
WHAT? <+++++> Wh-what's going on?
And that horrible museum tour! <+++++> No, I arranged that...
Please... Chandler is the love of my life... ... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! <+++++> So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?
Actually, I'm kinda happy to be leaving... I just broke up with someeone. <+++++> Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?
Actually, Alby is the guy I broke up with. <+++++> You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?
Yeah... <+++++> ... And you called him Alby!?  I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...
Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man. <+++++> Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!
Yes! And while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of issues... <+++++> Oh! like what?!  Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch  "Access Hollywood".
Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him. <+++++> Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?
A guy who won two. <+++++> Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart
Yeah... for three years. <+++++> Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?
... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend Billy. <+++++> Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?
No, but he did just win the McArthur genius grant. <+++++> Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine?
How is it going with Charlie? <+++++> Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.
Oh, What's the matter? <+++++> She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.
I always loved that!! <+++++> Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!!  Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God!
Worse? <+++++> Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians...   "Can we walk"?  Oh, you... you like that?
No. <+++++> What?
Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.  Dirk, this is my good friend Ross. <+++++> Nice to meet you.
Hey! So what show are you on? <+++++> Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology.
Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or... <+++++> Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.
Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs. <+++++> I'd lead with that.
What have you got there? <+++++> Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper? <+++++> It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize.
Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe Phd. <+++++> Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.
You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny... <+++++> And sexy.
Ok well give her a chance to see all of that! <+++++> Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her.
Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch! <+++++> Stop going through my stuff !
No. <+++++> Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?
Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere? <+++++> I'm smarter than him!
I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference. <+++++> Hey.
Hey. <+++++> Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
No, she's out shopping. <+++++> Damn!
What's going on? <+++++> I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it.
Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore? <+++++> Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the  "I get to see my wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this.
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work? <+++++> I have no idea. I mean But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
Oh look! A letter from my mom. <+++++> So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?
Oh my God! My dog died! <+++++> What?!
Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog! <+++++> Le Poo's still alive?!
Oh yeah! <+++++> Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there's this one thing Okay,  here goes. I made a promise that--Oh hey!
What? <+++++> You're nose is bleeding!
Oh God.  No! Oh not again!  This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry.  Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me? <+++++> Umm
Sorry. Sorry. <+++++> Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.
Hi! <+++++> Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out.
Okay, what's up? <+++++> Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants. <+++++> And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants
Yeah? <+++++> is for me not to see you anymore.
That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her?   Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you? <+++++> It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died! <+++++> You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you. <+++++> What are you doing?
Storming out! <+++++> Rachel, this is your apartment.
You want my advice? <+++++> Yes! Please!
You're not gonna like it. <+++++> That's okay.
You got married to fast. <+++++> That's not advice!
I told ya. <+++++> I'm going to the bathroom.
Okay, but try and get Joey too. <+++++> Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?
Oh, sure!  Bye Ross!  Forever. <+++++> Hi.
Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules? <+++++> I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.
Oh, Ross <+++++> No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?
No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you. <+++++> Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?
Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding! <+++++> I can't believe this is happening.
I know. <+++++> I am so sorry.
Oh no, wait! Joey! <+++++> 73! 72! 71!
Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or Phoebe? <+++++> What?
Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister. <+++++> Well, who's gonna kiss my sister.
Chandler. <+++++> Awww, man! Really?
Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler? <+++++> That's a good point.
Yeah. <+++++> Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.
Okay, great! <+++++> All right.
What?! <+++++> Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the history.
Yeah! <+++++> 3! 2! 1! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!
Happy New Year. <+++++> Happy New Year, Pheebs!
But your divorce isn't even final yet. <+++++> Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.
Do you want us to leave the room, or? <+++++> Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.
She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us. <+++++> In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar. <+++++> Ohh.
I'll see you tomorrow. <+++++> Okay!   Hey!
Hey! <+++++> I just asked that girl out.
Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today? <+++++> Yes it is. See.
Elizabeth Hornswoggle? <+++++> That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet! <+++++> Hi, Pheebs!
Hey! <+++++> Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth  Hornswoggle.
Hornswoggle?  Ooh, this must be killing you. <+++++> All right, see you later.
Then don't touch one!! <+++++> Hi!
That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight.  Maybe there's something in that area. <+++++> Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself,  "Wow,  I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."
Oh come on!! <+++++> Okay, seriously, what do you think?
Awful, absolutely awful. <+++++> What are you, what are you doing?
It's my New Year's resolution! <+++++> What, to blind my child?
No. <+++++> Okay, it must just be me then.
Okay, it must just be me then. <+++++> That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
No, go ahead. <+++++> Thanks.
Hey, my favorite part is coming up! <+++++> 'Kay!
'Kay! <+++++> Oh my God!
Hello? <+++++> Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!
Uhh, Chandler's not here. <+++++> Well, you can help me!
Okay. <+++++> Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom
Nice! <+++++> No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can't put them back on. I can't!
Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder? <+++++> Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder!
Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up. <+++++> Yeah, okay, hold on!   They're not coming on man.
Umm, do you see any -oh, Vaseline? <+++++> Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?
Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there. <+++++> Hold on.
Ross? You okay? <+++++> They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!
Really?! Uhh, what color is it? <+++++> What difference does that make?!
Joey, do you have a minute? <+++++> Dude, what am I gonna
Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out. <+++++> All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.
Oh my God! <+++++> I had a problem.
We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry. <+++++> This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
No. No, you're not a loser. <+++++> Look at me!
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you!  Huh? You're-you're a cowboy! <+++++> Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
Howdy partner! <+++++> Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides.  I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight.  I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.  I would make a good cowboy.
What are you doing? <+++++> I...reorganized the fridge. See, bottom shelf
Why are you doing this? <+++++> Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I've already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.
Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You've got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven't you ever been unemployed? <+++++> Hey, I am not unemployed. I 'm on sabbatical!
Hey, don't get religious on me, ok.  A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here sit down.  Ready?  Ahh!!  Ohh, yeah!! Huh?! <+++++> So what, we just sit?
That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it! <+++++> I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?
Wait a second, I could star in it! <+++++> Or that.
I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it. <+++++> I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.
Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?! <+++++> Yeah!
Thanks! <+++++> All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
Done! <+++++> And it can't be Joey.
It's not. <+++++> Or Joseph.
Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid -Op! Op! <+++++> This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work. <+++++> And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work.  Now come on!
Hey! <+++++> No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done!  Ahh!
Eww!! <+++++> So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?
Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something? <+++++> Sure.
Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle? <+++++> Oh-oh, yeah.
All the time. In fact, I was undefeated. <+++++> Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.
We don't, we don't wrestle now. <+++++> Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.
Too strong for me? <+++++> Yeah.
You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go? <+++++> Oh fine.
Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe! <+++++> Joey's not going.
Well, why can't you do them tomorrow? <+++++> Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done. <+++++> I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed. <+++++> I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Come on look guys, don't fight. <+++++> And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk? <+++++> If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors! <+++++> How about we settle this right now!  There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!
I paid for those tickets! <+++++> No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day? <+++++> Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today! <+++++> Yay!
No dude, Ross tore up the tickets! <+++++> I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?
All right. <+++++> All right.
Okay.   "It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out." Ross <+++++> Hey man.
What is up? <+++++> About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.
No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted. <+++++> Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest  But we had our best friend's interest at heart.
Could I be more sorry. <+++++> I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist.  All right Joey, we get it.  I'm sorry.
Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going. <+++++> I am sorry, Chandler.
Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out! <+++++> I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her. <+++++> I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!
I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius. <+++++> Hello.
Hello, Ross? <+++++> Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily!  It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush- shhst!  Hi!
Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good- bye! <+++++> No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!
Really? About what? <+++++> Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.
I miss you to. Well, at least I think I do. <+++++> She's talking.
Because I'm very happy for him!  And you , you lucky dog! <+++++> Hi!
Hey! <+++++> Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.
That's great! <+++++> In London!
What?! <+++++> She wants me to move to London.
What-what-what are you gonna do? <+++++> I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.
Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife. <+++++> It could happen.
I understand that would be difficult. <+++++> Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?
I don't know, it's just <+++++> Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.
All right. <+++++> All right, did you just say all right?
I did. Now I'm the idiot. <+++++> Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!
Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still. <+++++> Yes, tell me.
Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends. <+++++> I know. I am, I am so sorry.
And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her. <+++++> Again, very sorry.
I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her! <+++++> Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.
All right. I'll come to New York and we'll try and make this work. <+++++> Oh that is so great! That's
Great! <+++++> No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
What?! You can't -what did you tell her? <+++++> I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision?  I'm actually asking you!
No, you cannot. <+++++> Thanks for the help, problem solved.
Ooh, it's not a toy. <+++++> Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do.  Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again?  Ask again later. Later is not good enough.  Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!
Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late! <+++++> For what?
For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes. <+++++> Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay! <+++++> It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.
Like what? <+++++> Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help. <+++++> No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help.
Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to Hi! <+++++> Thanks.
Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it.  I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't.  Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy! <+++++> Hello.  Hi sweetie.  Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it.  So will you come to New York?
It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie. <+++++> Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!
I missed most of the party  Charlie's a girl, right? <+++++> Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did not kiss.
I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls at the party, GOD! <+++++> Why do you care so much?
Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... and I... want him to hook up with lots of women!  I just... All I'm saying is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common. <+++++> Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils...
All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean... <+++++> Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with it...
Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with it... <+++++> Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!
Hey! <+++++> Hi!
Hi! <+++++> I'm gonna get some more coffee.
Oh, you know what? I'll come with you! <+++++> Ok.
I feel like I owe you an explanation. I don't ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. I'm... well, I'm kind of embarrassed. I really hope you don't think less of me. <+++++> Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.
You know, actually I'm a little surprised to myself. I mean, Joey is so different from the guys I usually date. I mean, they're all professors, and intellectuals, and paleontologists mostly, you know, very cerebral... <+++++> Yeah, I know the type.
Ross! <+++++> Hi!
I need to talk to you about Charlie. <+++++> Oh, do you, do you really?
Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem. <+++++> Look, if you don't know what the word  "acrimonious" means, just don't use it!
No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her body is soo... <+++++> Get to the problem!
Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid! <+++++> Are you wearing two belts?
EH, what do you know! <+++++> You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.
Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out! <+++++> You know, I really don't want to get involved in you guy's relationship.
Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her. <+++++> Fine.
Thanks. <+++++> Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!
The Metsss! <+++++> Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Oh, that's what she meant!  You know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion! <+++++> Yeah, most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!
Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET. <+++++> Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.
Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date! <+++++> But I'm not! . You know what if you're in the mood for Thai food...
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok? <+++++> Ok.
You got to tell me exactly what to do there. <+++++> Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.
Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself. <+++++> Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks! <+++++> Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.
Phonetically? <+++++> Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time for this.
Ok. <+++++> Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on  "Days" I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy". <+++++> Wow. What does that mean?
No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means  "you're gonna get eaten by a bear". <+++++> Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! . <+++++> Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no! No ad-libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings.
Come on! you... <+++++> No!
Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die! <+++++> Respectfully, professor R. Geller.  Hey!
Hi! <+++++> Hey, how was the Met?
The museum was amazing! <+++++> Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?
Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to say, and some of it didn't even make any sense. <+++++> What do you mean?
Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around. <+++++> Wait a minute... when you guys walked into the Met, did you go to the right?
No, we went to the left. <+++++> Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.
Yeah, it's fun . <+++++> What?
Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really know me that well; it would be weird. <+++++> What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.
Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common with. You know what I mean? <+++++> Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.
Yeah, I guess that's true. <+++++> And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.
He is very sweet. Plus he's hot! <+++++> That was going to be my next argument.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me up. <+++++> Glad I could help man.
Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good. <+++++> Well, well, they're good. It's been a while since I've seen you like this. You, you clean up good.
Oh well, well thank you.  Okay, stop. Stop looking at me like that. The last time that happened,  that happened. <+++++> Oh right, right.  So, are you . . . ah . . . you excited about your, your first night away from Emma?
Yeah, yeah. Phoebe and I are going to have so much fun. And thank you for watching the baby, by the way. <+++++> Oh, it's fine. Actually, I, I invited Mike over.
Phoebe's Mike? <+++++> Yeah.
I didn't know you guys hung out. <+++++> We don't. But I thought it would be nice to get to know him. You know, maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.
Oh that's so cute <+++++> I don't know. But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know. He plays piano; I played keyboards in college. He's been divorced; I have some experience in that area.
Ok. So now, I think Emma is probably down for the night, but if you need anything Ross . . . <+++++> Rach, Rach, we'll be fine, all right? You go have fun.
Bye. <+++++> So . . . Welcome.
I got beer. <+++++> I got bottled breast milk.
Eh, why don't we start with the beer? <+++++> Okay.  So, um, Phoebe tells me you, ah, you play piano.
Yeah. <+++++> You know, I, I used to, ah, play keyboards in college.
Ah?  Do you have one here? <+++++> No.
Okay. <+++++> Um . . . ah . . . you know, I'm divorced. Um, Phoebe, ah . . . Phoebe said you . . . You've been divorced?
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't . . . I don't really like to talk about it. <+++++> That's okay. We'll talk about  something else.
So, you're a paleontologist, right? <+++++> Yeah.
My cousin's a paleontologist. <+++++> Ah?  Well, he and I would probably have a lot to talk about.
Ross and Rachel's apartment. Mike is blowing a note from his beer bottle. Ross stares off to the side.) <+++++> Shouldn't the pizza be here by now? I mean, they said thirty minutes or less. Well, how long has it been?
Eleven minutes.  And now twelve. So, do you like the beer? <+++++> I do. I do. Although, it's actually a lager.
huh.  What's the difference between beer and lager? <+++++> I don't know. We could look it up.
Ya know, I'm going to take off. <+++++> So soon?
Well, yeah. <+++++> Okay. Well, thanks, ah, thanks for the beer.
Ah, you mean lager. <+++++> Ah yeah. Good times.
Hey buddy. <+++++> Uh, hi.
Um, can I come back in? <+++++> Why?
I, I was just thinking about how much more we have to talk about. <+++++> But you left.
So, except for the fermentation process, beer and ale are basically the same thing. Fascinating isn't it. <+++++> Maybe you should look up "fascinating."
I'll get it.  Hello? Ross's place. Mike speaking.  It's for you. <+++++> I don't understand what just happened here.
Hi. <+++++> Oh God.
Wow. So, what did you guys do? <+++++> Oh, you know . . . we just drank some beer and Mike played with the boundaries of normal social conduct.
See you guys. <+++++> Rachel, lock the door. Lock the door, seriously.
Yeah. <+++++> Hello.  Ah, no, she's not here right now. Can I take a message?  Bill from the bar?  Okay, "Bill from the bar." I'll make sure she gets your number.
Aaah. <+++++> So, ah . . . So, how was it? Uh, did you guys. . . Did you guys have a good time?
Oh, it was so much fun. It felt so good to be out. <+++++> Uh, Rach.
Yeah? <+++++> Never mind.
Ross, when 's this comet thing start? <+++++> Well, technically it seven billion years ago
Oh no! Oh no! <+++++> Okay! Okay! Fine, I 'll stop! No teaching, okay? We'll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky.  Okay? Who's official name is Bapstein-King.
Oh I don 't-I don't know. <+++++> Man, look at all those stars!  Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesn 't it?
Y 'know what else makes you wonder? <+++++> Huh?
Ross! <+++++> What?
Come here, check this out! <+++++> What? Is it the comet?
No! No-no. Look, there 's a bug stuck in tar right here. <+++++> Joey come -I can't believe-I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of nature's most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
Y 'know, there's two women dude. <+++++> Show me where?
Right-right up here. <+++++> Joey where 's the pipe that was holding the door open?
I don 't know!   Yeah, I do. <+++++> Joey!
What?! All right -Hey! Don't look at me! You're the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet! <+++++> It 's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay?  Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
Come on! <+++++> I can 't believe this!!
All right well, y 'know I guess we know what we have to do to get down. <+++++> Yeah, I guess we don 't have a choice.  Help us! Please help us! We're stuck up on the roof and we can't get down!!!
Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape. <+++++> I know, I wasn 't finished.   But don't worry! We're gonna go down the fire escape!!
All right, it won 't go down any further. It's stuck. <+++++> Ugh. Well, we 're just gonna have to jump.  Yeah. Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there you go up to the roof and you let me in.
Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?! <+++++> Yeah! Oh yeah, you 'll be fine! It-it'll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y'know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won't.
What if I smack my head on the concrete? <+++++> Well, I 'm gonna lie to you Joey, it's a possibility.
I don 't know Ross! I-I tell you what, let's flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right? <+++++> Oh, all right.  Tails!  Can you-can you see what it is?
No. <+++++> Okay. Well, you be careful.
What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I 'm not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can't go if I break my leg. <+++++> Well I 'm jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won't have a father if-if I die!
Man, I 'm starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both! <+++++> Y 'know, y'know I'm lookin' and I don't think anyone's home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y'know explain later.
Yeah? Really? No one 's home? <+++++> I don 't think so. Hello?  When you get in there
Yeah! <+++++> Okay, I 'm going to start climb down you now.
All right! Just hurry up! <+++++> Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we 're face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we're-we're butt to face.
I think face to face. <+++++> I would say that.
Face to face, yeah! <+++++> Okay, here I go.
Oh my How much do you weigh Ross?! <+++++> I prefer not to answer that right now, I 'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
Y 'know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through. <+++++> So what do you want me to do?
Well, just shimmy down me and drop! <+++++> Hi.
Hi. <+++++> M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.
Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while! <+++++> It 's still looks pretty far!
It 's not that far! Just drop! <+++++> Do not rush me!!
Ross, you should know that my pants are startin ' to come down and I'm not wearing any underwear! <+++++> Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I -Ooh, a quarter!
Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2! <+++++> Joey, we just saw it!
And? <+++++> And it 'll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
Die Hard!!!!!! <+++++> Dude, you didn 't say Die Hard. Is everything okay?
Yeah, I just got uh, got plans. <+++++> Well, John McLane had plans!
Well, I don 't know!! <+++++> We fell asleep! That is all.
Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I 'd better go. <+++++> I think that would be best.
Yeah. All right, I 'll talk to you later. <+++++> Okay. But not about this!
No! Never! Never!  Bye. <+++++> No touch! No touch!
Hey there, you handsome thing. <+++++> Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio.
Hi. <+++++> Just uh, brought back your videos.
Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before. <+++++> No! No we don 't!
Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!! <+++++> I I don 't know what you are talking about.
Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had! <+++++> I 've had better.
Okay! When?! <+++++> All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
Uh-huh! <+++++> I 've said it! Okay?! But it's over Joey!
I want to do it again. <+++++> We can 't do it again.
Why not? <+++++> Because it 's weird!
Fine! Do you want something to drink? <+++++> Sure, what do you got?
Okay, all right, this is how it 's going to work. We're gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest. <+++++> No, 10 is the highest.
Why is 10 the highest? <+++++> Because it 's the highest.  Okay, Rachel you're up first.  Situation No. 1
Thanks! <+++++> Yes, very nice Rachel.
We 're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go! <+++++> When Monica was a little girl, I remember that --Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?! <+++++> It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
Ohh, wait a minute, we haven 't pre <+++++> Go!
Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster 's Dictionary defines marriage as  Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old. <+++++> Oh! That 's nice.
Wow.  Good speech. <+++++> Yeah, it really was!
Aw, thanks! <+++++> Okay Phoebe, I guess you 're next  although I really don't see the point.
What?! <+++++> I 'm sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.
Well then I demand a recount! <+++++> Actually, it wasn 't that close.
Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me. <+++++> Yeah?
Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch. <+++++> Why-why would I care about that?
Great nap. <+++++> It really was.
Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God! <+++++> Excuse me.
I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you. <+++++> She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
Any contact? <+++++> She lent me an egg once.
You're in! <+++++> Aw, right.
Hi, Ross. <+++++> Hey.
Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks. <+++++> An egg?
I think it's winning. <+++++> I think it's insane.
Pathetic mess? I know, but -come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching!  Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this. <+++++> Hi. She said yes.
That's funny. Who are they? <+++++> The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
You mean they're lovers. <+++++> If you wanna put a label on it.
Wow, uh, anything else I should know? <+++++> Nope, nope, that's it.
Nope, nope, that's it. <+++++> Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part.  Helloo!
I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry. <+++++> Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
I guess. <+++++> Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine. <+++++> Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin......does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine. <+++++> You did so. I swear, I swear - How long has she been in the bathroom?
Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone. <+++++> Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
That could be it. <+++++> Oh, god.  You know, this is still pretty hot.
Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny <+++++> No, it's just...you know the whole  "getting on with your life" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.
Oh, I love you too. But... <+++++> No but, no but.
You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you. <+++++> That's easy for you to say, you found one already.
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn 't that sad?  God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be? <+++++> I know what you mean, I 've always wondered how different my life would be if-if I'd never gotten divorced.
Which time? <+++++> The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn 't realized she was a lesbian.
I can 't. I keep seeing it the good way. <+++++> I 'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay.  Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical.
Sure I would! <+++++> Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!
What, you guys really think that I 'm that shallow? <+++++> No, I just think Monica was that fat.
What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch? <+++++> What?!
Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y 'know that if I'd work with stocks, I'd have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox. <+++++> Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we 'd still hang out?
Rob Tillman! <+++++> No-no. It 's-it's me, Ross!
Oh, I 'm sorry. Ross Tillman. <+++++> No, no-no, Ross Geller.
Ohh, of course Monica 's brother! <+++++> Yeah. Right.
Wow! How are you?! <+++++> Good-good, I 'm-I'm married.
Ohh! Me too! <+++++> Is-isn 't it the best?
Oh, it 's the best!  So, umm how's Monica? <+++++> Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she 's right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.
Ohh, I would love too. <+++++> Yeah? Oh-oh, she 'd be so excited!
Ohh! Okay! <+++++> Come on!
Oh wait, don 't you have to pay for your,  Busty Ladies? <+++++> No, it 's okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don't
Oh yeah? Okay. <+++++> Okay.
But! Don 't you have to give him his money back? <+++++> Uh-huh.  Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you.  Okay, let 's go see Monica!
Ohh that 's so sweet!  Oh! Hang on!  Hang onnnnnn!!!   Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0, it's a number! It comes after 4-9!! No, it's okay. It's okay, you're allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired. <+++++> Hey Mon!
Hey! <+++++> Mon, look who I ran into!
You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds! <+++++> And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler.
Oh yeah. <+++++> And that 's Phoebe over there!
Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we 've seen each other? <+++++> 1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon 's party. I played you one of my songs, y'know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.
Oh yeah. Right. So now, are -do you, do you still do music? <+++++> Sometimes, you should come over  sometime! I 'll play you one of my other
Well it 's kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he's not real. <+++++> Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!
So what 's going on with you? <+++++> Well umm, I 've been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.
Still going through that dry spell with Carol? <+++++> Yeah.
How long has it been since you had sex? <+++++> Well, last weekend
Oh that 's not so bad. <+++++> will be two months
That is. <+++++> since I stopped trying.
Maybe you need to spice things up a little. <+++++> What-what do you mean?
I don 't know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other <+++++> Oh.
Y 'know, dirty talk, mÃÂ©nage ÃÂ  trois, toys <+++++> Wow!
Roll playing You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench! <+++++> Okay, I think I got it.
Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms. <+++++> Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.
What do you mean? <+++++> Carol our sex life is -it's just not working
Dad!! <+++++> Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why don 't we get some shoes on ya, huh? Hey, why don't you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! Yay!!
Yay! <+++++> Yay!  Seriously, our sex life I was thinking, maybe I don 't know, we could try some-some new things. Y'know? For fun?
Like what? <+++++> Well I don 't know umm,  what if we were too tie each other up?  Umm, some people eat stuff off one another.  Nah! Umm, y'know we-we could try dirty talk?  Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
Okay! Okay!  I 'm so glad you're here. <+++++> Come on.  I got it.
Oh, give it to me. <+++++> I got it!
Give it! <+++++> Hello?  No she can 't come to the phone right now.  Oh, right no problem. Okay, bye-bye.
Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?! <+++++> J-j-just relax, nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that you were getting better.
Thank God. <+++++> Yeah, she 's fired.
Ooh, actually I 've been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this! <+++++> Oh.  Wow!  Huh.  Boy!  Well, someone 's been doing their homework.
Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so <+++++> Oh, I know.  Y 'know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda
Oh, me too. <+++++> Yeah? Well, I-I think Ben 's asleep.
Oh umm, y 'know I think it would be better if we just save it. <+++++> Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that.
Hey. <+++++> Hey, how 's it going?
But, I put some honey in it. <+++++> She doesn 't know she was fired yet, does she?
But I think we should tell her. <+++++> Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.
Looks like it. <+++++> Y 'know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at
I got it! <+++++> Okay.
Oh, I wouldn 't miss it for the world. <+++++> I 'm-I'm Ross by the way.
Thank you so much. <+++++> How hot is this?!
Hey! <+++++> Look at you! You 're up!
Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol 's great and I'm sure you're a very attractive man, but I . <+++++> No! The reason I 'm asking is that I sorta had one last night.
You? <+++++> Yeah!
Wow! <+++++> Yeah!
All right! So, was it amazing? <+++++> It was, it was okay.
Just okay -Did you do it right?! <+++++> Look, it 's just did, did you ever go to a party and think, "Would really anyone miss me if I weren 't here?"
Huh. But still Ross, you 're worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y'know what I mean? <+++++> Oh-oh, absolutely!
Oh-oh, absolutely! <+++++> It 's just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around.
But you got to be with both of them, right? <+++++> Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
Not the other one? <+++++> No, she kept kicking me away!
Yeah, you don 't want that. <+++++> No!
Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right? <+++++> Oh I a lot of stuff!
You got a little bored? <+++++> A little. Yeah. I made a snack.
Yeah? What did ya have? <+++++> Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard
Sounds good. <+++++> It really was!
Hi Ross! <+++++> Hey Rachel.
Is Joey Tribbiani here? <+++++> Umm, no.
Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I 'm looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up! <+++++> That-that 's always good news. Are you okay?
Me? I 'm great! I'm fine! I'm sooo good!! But, you know who's not great?! Men! You're a man right Ross?! <+++++> Yeah.
Sit down! <+++++> Okay.
Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we 're going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor 's dog walker?! <+++++> We 're sorry.
No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage? <+++++> Didn 't you spend last night at Joey's?
Aw what are you?! A detective? <+++++> Look I-I don 't know what's going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.
Oh. <+++++> Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a two some with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
Who are these men? <+++++> Men. I guy I know.
Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is  gay. <+++++> She is not  She 's gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can 't believe this.
Good day for married people huh? <+++++> I 'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
I 'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren't that great either. <+++++> Try telling my wife that.
Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago. <+++++> Hey!
Hey, mister tux! <+++++> Why aren't you guys dressed?
We have a half hour. <+++++> No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight.
Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed. <+++++> Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.
Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy. <+++++> Really.
Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi. <+++++> Hi.
How come you didn't come over earlier? <+++++> 'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man.
Hey, Ross, want some cider? <+++++> No.  So, um, let's see your pretty close, huh. Make-up's on, hair's done.
Yeah, I just have to get dressed. <+++++> Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes.
What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech? <+++++> No! Do you wanna hear it?
Am I in it? <+++++> Uh, huh. Yeah, right after I thank everyone for giving money to the museum, I sing a song about the wonder that is Joey.
Hello. <+++++> Hey!
Whoa! <+++++> Wow, hello! You look great!
Thank you! I know, though. <+++++> You see this, this is a person who is ready to go. Phoebe you, oh, you are my star.
Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo... <+++++> You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..
Hi. <+++++> Hey.
Ooh, are you gonna do magic? <+++++> That's, that's funny. Change!
Hang on a second I just got in. <+++++> Look, I don't care it starts at eight, we can't be late.
We could not, would not want to wait. <+++++> Look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is gonna be there, everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.
"Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm already there when your playing this message?"  Is that too spooky? <+++++> "Hi Rach, are you there? It's me, pick up. Rachel. Rach!"
What?! <+++++> Nevermind.
Is-is-is that message old or new?  Old or new?! Old or new?! <+++++> It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?
Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old. <+++++> Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing. And you know what I did?
Huh? <+++++> I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay.  There we go, there we go.
What am I gonna do? <+++++> No, no, don't, don't, rub it! Don't!  What gets out hummus?! What gets out hummus?!
All right! <+++++> Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay.
No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on. <+++++> No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes.
I called him. <+++++> Nooo.
I know the code to his answering machine. <+++++> Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the... Okay, you're dialing, you are dialing.
Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle? <+++++> Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.
Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?! <+++++> You don't, you don't know what your wearing?
Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night. <+++++> Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you.
Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room. <+++++> Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep. <+++++> Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi! <+++++> Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?
We used them as pillows when we went camping. <+++++> What?
The sheep. <+++++> Hey, what you do on your own time...
Where's my underwear?! <+++++> Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?
He took my essence! <+++++> Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?
Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now. <+++++> Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?
Okay, I'm ready. <+++++> Oh, aaaah!
Duh!! Christmas! <+++++> Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch.  Okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail isn't going around any more.  What time is it? It's 7
Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple? <+++++> Just, just, just pick one!
Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants? <+++++> Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.
But I... <+++++> No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go.
All right. <+++++> Thank you!
Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to. <+++++> It was, it was her voice.
See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now. <+++++> Yay!
Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!!  That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back. <+++++> No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.
Okay, we're on it. We're on it. <+++++> Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um.
I'm not gonna gooo. <+++++> You're not going to go.
No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence. <+++++> How, how, um how can you not be going?
I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going. <+++++> Um, you know, just out of curiosity...
Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood. <+++++> Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.
It's fine. <+++++> No, but, your-your mad.
I'm not mad. <+++++> No.
I'm just not going. <+++++> Your not going.
Right. <+++++> Okay. You know that I-I have to go.
Um, hum. <+++++> Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.'
No. <+++++> No, because your not upset.
Right. <+++++> About the yelling.
Right, and the humiliating. <+++++> Oh, well of course, the humiliating. So, so wee, we're okay.
Um, hum. <+++++> We're good.
Right. <+++++> Okay. Honey?
Yes, Ross. <+++++> I love you.
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges. <+++++> Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!
Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed. <+++++> You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.
You could drink the fat. <+++++> Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.
No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting. <+++++> What?
Yaaaay! <+++++> Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.
Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out. <+++++> I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers.
No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go! <+++++> You will?!
You were really gonna do that, weren't you? <+++++> Well, yeah.
Let's see what else he'll do! <+++++> How 'bout instead you, go get changed!  You, give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica!
Noooo!!!! <+++++> Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!
Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself. <+++++> Rachel!!  Wow! You, uh, you look, wow!
And I still have about five seconds to spare.  Okay, that was about seven seconds. <+++++> So we're a little late.
Come on.  Oh! And, uh, by the way.... <+++++> What?
I'm going commando, too. <+++++> Awwww!!!
Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute. <+++++> Wow! What a pleasure.
You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you 've got a girlfriend? <+++++> Is this about Mark?
Oh my God. <+++++> Okay, it 's not, it's not.
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break. <+++++> Fine, you 're right. Let's ah, let's take a break,  let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yoghurt, or something..
Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don 't want to take a break. <+++++> I 've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
Hey, what do you want to drink? <+++++> Who 's that?
Nobody. <+++++> Is that Mark?
Umm, honey, look he just came over to.... <+++++> Yeah! Got it!
Hi, it 's me. I've been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid. <+++++> Yeah!!
Eh, I 'm just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I don't want to get back together over a machine. <+++++> Na-huh.
So, I love you. <+++++> I love you.
And y'know what, I 'm gonna, I'm gonna go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, I'm gonna stop by around 8 <+++++> Okay.
Bye. <+++++> Chloe, Chloe how 's it coming?!!
Hey, what kind of puppy do you think I should get? <+++++> Umm, oh, hey, I don 't know. How about a big one?
But my apartment is so... <+++++> Well then a small one!! Listen, let 's, we kinda have to get going!
Wait! Where 's my shoes? <+++++> You, you sure you need shoes?  Okay.
Do I know why we 're rushing? <+++++> Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?  Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
That 's so great for you guys! <+++++> Yeah!
You must be so happy! <+++++> Yes, yes I am, one of the many things I 'm feeling. Well....
Good luck, with your girlfriend. <+++++> Oh, thank you.  Hey, hey.  Rachel!!!!
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message. <+++++> Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again? <+++++> Yes, you can, very much.
Yes, you can, very much. <+++++> Ahhhh!!
Yeah. We figured when we couldn 't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh? <+++++> You think?! God, I, ah, I 'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all like, 'I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, 'What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did.
Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you? <+++++> What?! Look, we 're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
Yeah, and there won 't be a relationship left to rebuild. <+++++> Yeah, but don 't you think....
All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing 's right. And that's what deathbeds are for. <+++++> Yeah, okay.
All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn 't find out some other way.  Did you think about the trail? <+++++> What trail?
The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it!  You always have to think about the trail! <+++++> Oh, I-I don 't think there's any trail.
Is this about me taking your watch? <+++++> You took my watch?
I 'm sorry, I do that. <+++++> Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
Oh no. I feel it isn 't really anybody's business, y'know. <+++++> Exactly. So you didn 't, didn't mention anything to Issac right?
Oh, well I tell Issac everything. <+++++> You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven 't actually met...
You dog! <+++++> Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.
Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place. <+++++> Yeah, that 's the one. Listen, I don't want to hurt her.
Oh, hey, man I know, doesn 't matter how much we love 'em, monogamy is too cruel a rule. <+++++> Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We 're the same, you and me. <+++++> Actually, no, we 're not.
Yeah, we are. <+++++> No, we 're not.
Yeah, we are. <+++++> No, we 're not!!
Okay, we 're not. <+++++> Right.
But, we are. <+++++> Fine. I just need to know that you 're not gonna tell your sister.
Uh-huh. <+++++> We met at Phoebe 's birthday party, I'm, I'm Ross Geller.
You did a bad thing! <+++++> Yes, I did.
Very bad! <+++++> Very bad.
Very, very bad. <+++++> I 'm agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?
No. <+++++> Okay, Jasmine, please, please don 't. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?
All right. <+++++> Thank you, thank you.
But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too. <+++++> Who 's your roommate?
What, what are they talking about? <+++++> Rachel?
Just get away from me! <+++++> No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here! <+++++> No!!
Just get out! Now!! <+++++> No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let 's talk about it!! How was she? <+++++> She was...
Good different? <+++++> Nobody likes change.
Nobody likes change. <+++++> What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave?  Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?! <+++++> Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!
And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!! <+++++> Look, I didn 't think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.
We were on a break! <+++++> That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
You think you 're gonna get out of this on a technicality? <+++++> Look, I 'm not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!
God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!! <+++++> Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn 't happen!
All right. Let 's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me? <+++++> Yes I would.
You 'd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me? <+++++> Yes.
You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were.... <+++++> La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it 's, I mean it's you.
I 'm thinking, I'm gonna order a pizza. <+++++> Order a pizza like,  'I forgive you?'
Fine.  Hi! Yes, I 'd like to order a large pizza. <+++++> No anchovies.
With ah, extra anchovies. <+++++> That 's okay, I'll just pick 'em off.
That 's.... <+++++> That 's what?!
That is neither here nor there. <+++++> Okay, well here we are. Now we 're in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail?  Look, I,  I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I'm sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can't.  I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.
No Ross!!  Don 't! You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn't work that way. It doesn't just make it better. Okay? <+++++> Okay, okay, okay.
I think you should go. <+++++> What?
I really think you need to go now. <+++++> Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn 't work past it together...
Yeah, what the hell did I know! <+++++> Look, look, there 's got to be a way we can work past this. Okay,  I can't imagine, I can't imagine my life without you.  Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach,  and, and....
Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year. <+++++> What?
Hey! <+++++> Are you kidding?
Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus , we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us. <+++++> That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!
No, no! We made this decision together. <+++++> She's putting words in your mouth!
You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes! <+++++> Hey! Hey, guess what Joey has!
Three tickets to today's Rangers game!! <+++++> Dude, I wanted him to guess.
Yeah, they're great seats too! <+++++> Guess where they are?
Center ice. <+++++> Did I do something to you?
Hmm, the game's at one. <+++++> So?
Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go! <+++++> He's right, man.
That's some gentle comedy, dude. <+++++> We're still going at the game, right?
Yeah! <+++++> Yeah.
Oh, Bob, get off the guy! <+++++> Oh! What a game, huh?
I know, yeah. <+++++> I can't believe Chandler is missing this!
Yeah. I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say,  I am really enjoying Nacho Chair. <+++++> Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.
Ohhhh! These seats are great! <+++++> I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice  I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!
Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner. <+++++> Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal.
I don't know... <+++++> One more fight!
Okay. <+++++> Okay.
How late are we? <+++++> Forty-five minutes.
Wow <+++++> Here!
Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were! <+++++> You may want to lose the foam finger!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand! <+++++> Hey!
What are you doing here! <+++++> We're late too!
Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani! <+++++> So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!
Yeah, where were you! <+++++> Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy!
And I won! <+++++> You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee.
Yes!  Y-E-S. Yes! <+++++> Let me see this...  Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division.
Yeah. That's me! <+++++> You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?
Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before... <+++++> I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!
She won a thousand dollars! <+++++> So this is an annual thing?
You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier! <+++++> Yeah. What are we gonna do?
Alright, what are we gonna say? <+++++> Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!
No. Here <+++++> HEY!
Alright, Emma is napping...  what happened to your shirt? <+++++> I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.
We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this <+++++> That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time. <+++++> We know you're out there.
Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad. <+++++> Well, let's just go in there and face them.
Ah-haah! I win!! <+++++> What is that?
Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time. <+++++> Alright, okay.
It's locked. <+++++> Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're having sex on the couch, its like
That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand. <+++++> FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!!
Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS. <+++++> That's worse than no food.
Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us. <+++++> I don't know...
I'm telling ya...  I can do it. <+++++> Yeah, he can do it!
Come on you guys, we want you to know we're  very very sorry.   Right guys? <+++++> I feel terrible.
So bad. <+++++> So bad.
Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do. <+++++> Really girls, not cool.
Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness! <+++++> It's a day to be thankful.
Yeah! I'll cook! <+++++> Yeah! Let's go out.
I'll pull you through. <+++++> Okay.
I lent them to Ross. <+++++> I gave them to Joey.
Oh! <+++++> I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.
I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants. <+++++> Nice!
To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio. <+++++> I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.
Great! <+++++> Really? Which one?
Ohh! Fish, seaweed, a sunken ship. <+++++> Things you find in the ocean,  You're gonna be on "Pyramid"!!
Oh, that was our favourite game show ever! <+++++> Except for "Match game"...
Yeah, sorry boys, this ride's closing. <+++++> Oh, and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing. I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond.
Seriously? <+++++> Yeah-uh!
"I'm a little bit country"... <+++++> "...and I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll"!
Who? <+++++> He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.
Did I go to this school? <+++++> Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her.
Sure, nice. <+++++> Dude. You're married to my sister.
You're right, by saying "nice" I'm virtually licking her. <+++++> Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out?
Are you asking permission to break the pact? <+++++> Yes please.
Awesome, the name really stands out. <+++++> Thanks to a little something called "Helvetica Bold 24 point"!
Hey! <+++++> Hey, Missy...
You know, our band is playing on Friday. <+++++> Yeah, yeah. You should come check us out. We're called "Way! No Way!".
No way! <+++++> Way!
Fresh! <+++++> Boss!
Mint! <+++++> She's gone.
I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out. <+++++> Dude, I was gonna ask her out.
I said it first, bro. <+++++> Well, I thought it first, Holmes.
Look, if you did... <+++++> Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want.
Totally. I had sex in High school... <+++++> Me too. I'm good at it.
All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg. <+++++> You got it.
All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with. <+++++> Those are the pacts!
Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway. <+++++> Oh, oh... maybe not you!
Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact. <+++++> Thank you.  All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?
Your hands are shaking. <+++++> I know, and I can't stop sweating.
I'd love to! <+++++> Great!
So how come it took you so long to ask me out? <+++++> Oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?
Sure, he was in your "band"? <+++++> It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
Sorry. <+++++> That's ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!
Really? <+++++> Yeah, why?
Well, Chandler and I used to make out! A lot! <+++++> You did?
Yeah. We'd go to the science lab after hours! <+++++> AND ON MY TURF?
Excuse me. . That didn't make us sound gay at all! <+++++> You broke the pact!
Ross, that was 16 years ago! <+++++> That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.
I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair.  All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts. <+++++> I didn't.
Oh really? <+++++> No.
Oh really!? <+++++> NO!
Yes? <+++++> Hey! Hey Adrienne.
Hey! Hey Adrienne. <+++++> I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.
Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her. <+++++> I don't know what... you're talking about.
Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days. <+++++> Listen Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about this.
Oh believe me, Ross, I won't be telling anybody about this. <+++++> Cool!
Well, I did and it hurt.  That's when I wrote the song <+++++> Man... I... I'm sorry.
Look  it was a lo-o-ong time ago. <+++++> So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even.
Hmm mmmhm.. <+++++> We are even, right?
Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody? <+++++> What did you do to my mom?
She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital. <+++++> Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
What? When was this? <+++++> Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.
Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter. <+++++> Well, it matters to me.
Why? <+++++> Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.
Seriously, where did this happen? <+++++> Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.
Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on? <+++++> Mine.
I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed. <+++++> No, she was definitely on my bed.
Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed? <+++++> Well, then who was on my bed?
OH! Oh, oh! <+++++> NO! No, no!
YES! <+++++> You were under the pile of coats?
I was the pile of coats! <+++++> OH MY GOD!
You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser? <+++++> You were my first kiss with Rachel?
Hey! <+++++> Hey...
So, you know... I have a little time. If you... if you want to... <+++++> Oh...   Ohh... I'd love to but I really have to grade these papers.
Fine, it's fine...  I'll just shower by myself... <+++++> B, B, B, B, B!
Oh, Ross, you gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalogue. <+++++> Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt.
Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt. <+++++> Damnit!
Rachel!! Open up!! It's your sister!!  I have to talk to you!! <+++++> Hi Amy!
You're not Rachel. <+++++> Still sharp as a tack!
H-Hi!! And you are...? <+++++> Ross? I... I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together last year... I had a baby with your sister!
N-no... uhm... did I buy a falafel from you yesterday? <+++++> Yes, yes, you did.
Wait, this is important! Can Ella wait? <+++++> Ehm... Her name is Emma.
Why did you change it, Ella was so much prettier! <+++++> What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!
Hey, your English is getting better!! <+++++> Oh my God!
I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated. <+++++> What... what you working on?
Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so... <+++++> Why don't you use your Thesaurus?
What did I just say? <+++++> Watch.  Here, you ehm... You highlight the word you want to change.
Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song. <+++++> Seriously?
Phoebe, that 's huge! <+++++> Well, do you wanna marry him?
I think it could be kind of great! <+++++> Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!
Hello?  Oh, it's our nanny!  Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye!   That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today? <+++++> No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting?
Menstrual cramps. <+++++> I don't think that's what this is.
Well, actually... <+++++> Well, can I talk to you for a sec.?
Yeah. <+++++> Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.
Why not? <+++++> Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!
Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name! <+++++> Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.
Wha... the next one? <+++++> Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby.
Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!! <+++++> I... I don't know..
Ugh. <+++++> Hey guys.
Hi Ross. <+++++> Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see. .
Nah, I don't really want her to see. <+++++> Why not?
Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat? <+++++> Come here  Oh! There she is! Hi!
Come here  Oh! There she is! Hi! <+++++> What?
Nothing. <+++++> Hi!  What... . Please tell me those are clip-ons.
Oh, they're real! <+++++> Did she  do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her!
What? <+++++> That's not a thing!
Enter Amy! <+++++> Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna...
What? What are you gonna do? <+++++> No more falafel for you!
What? <+++++> Hi.
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them. <+++++> Really.
No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody. <+++++> Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?
Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual... <+++++> Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.
Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl? <+++++> Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who...
Hi. <+++++> ...Gets interrupted. Hi!
Hugh! Hugh Grant! <+++++> Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
And I will see you tomorrow! <+++++> That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you.
Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this? <+++++> 'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there.
I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already? <+++++> I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
She really said that? <+++++> Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
'Tonight' tonight? <+++++> Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey. <+++++> Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face...  ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks. <+++++> Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?
Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine? <+++++> Yeah. You, uh, you want some?
Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark? <+++++> Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff?  Well-
Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this. <+++++> Okay, quick and painful.
Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me. <+++++> Oh, what? What-what?
Y'know Marcel? <+++++> ...Yeah?
I know, I know, I'm sorry- <+++++> No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.
See? I've even called Animal Control! <+++++> You called Animal Control?
Uh-huh... why... do you not like them? <+++++> Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.
O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that... <+++++> That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!
Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding! <+++++> Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.
Turned out it was a hat. <+++++> Cat!
Marcel? <+++++> My uncle Marcel.
Marcel? <+++++> Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.
Ross, you don't know that. <+++++> Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village.  And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.
Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here.  Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?! <+++++> Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!
Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose. <+++++> Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...
Ross. <+++++> I don't even wanna hear it, you're just...
Ross. <+++++> Oh, forget it, okay?
Ross! <+++++> What? What?
Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea. <+++++> Hi, did you order some bananas?
What about it? <+++++> Gimme back my monkey.
Potassium. <+++++> Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?
Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel? <+++++> Marcel! What've you done to him?
That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey. <+++++> Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon.
C'mere, Patti. <+++++> C'mere, Marcel.
Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey!  Gotcha. <+++++> Okay, gimme my monkey back.
That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever. <+++++> Alright, I want my monkey.
Sorry, prom queen. <+++++> You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.
Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit. <+++++> Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...
Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your... <+++++> Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?
That'd be good. <+++++> Alright.  The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming.  Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...
I can't. I can't do it, I can't marry Mindy. I think I'm still in love with you. <+++++> Oh!
Oh! <+++++> We have got to start locking that door!
Op! We gotta go! <+++++> Oh, where are you guys going?
We 're gonna pick up the wedding dress then we're gonna have lunch with mom. <+++++> Ah. Joey you 're-you're having lunch with my mom?
No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure! <+++++> Y 'know what? Actually I'm kinda glad they're leaving 'cause uh, I need to talk to you about something.
What 's up? <+++++> Well this uh, this may be a little awkward.
Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I 'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night. <+++++> No, its Its not that. Umm, now what I'm going to say to you, I'm not saying as your friend. Okay? I 'm-I'm saying as it as Monica's older brother.
But you 're still my friend? <+++++> Not for the next few minutes.
During this time are you, are you still my best man? <+++++> Nope.
Do I still call you Ross? <+++++> Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldn 't be more thrilled for both of you, but as Monica's older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down, and kick your ass!  What? I'm-I'm-I'm serious!  Come-Hey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? I'm-I'm not kidding here!
Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning. <+++++> No problem.
So are we friends again? <+++++> Yeah.
Mr. and Mrs. Bing! <+++++> Wow Monica! Hey, just so you know I had my uh, older brother chat with Chandler.
What is that? <+++++> Well I I told him that if he ever hurt you I would hunt him down and kick his ass!  What?! What?! What is the matter with everybody?! I am serious! I would kick his ass!
You could kick anyone 's ass you want too. <+++++> Thanks you guys.
Oh I get it! A man duh! <+++++> Can I have everyone 's attention please? I'm uh; I'm Ross Geller.
Doctor Ross Geller. <+++++> Dad dad, please! As I was saying umm, I'm Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh, and I'm the best man. And uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is my little sister. And, she's the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if you'd all please join me in raising a glass to the, the couple we're here to celebrate.  To the Bings.
Hey! Where have you been? <+++++> Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.
Oh. <+++++> What? Are you going back to work?
Yeah. <+++++> Nice shades.
Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won 't get spit in the eyes, y'know? <+++++> And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!
Great! All right. I 'll see you later. <+++++> Hey, where 's Chandler?
Uh, I think he 's in Rachel's room. See ya. <+++++> Chandler?  Chandler?
Hi! <+++++> Is uh, is Monica here?
She 's steaming her dress, why? What's up? <+++++> I think Chandler 's gone.
What?! <+++++> He left that.
Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he 's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry. <+++++> I think it means he freaked out and left!
Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do? <+++++> Look -Okay, I'm just gonna-I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
Okay but if you don 't find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass! <+++++> I will, I will find him.
No. No, I haven 't seen him. <+++++> Oh damn!
He 's getting married tomorrow right? <+++++> Yes. Yes. Don 't worry. Everything's fine. We'll uh, we'll see you tomorrow at the wedding.
I wasn 't invited. <+++++> Well then we 'll-we'll see you the day after tomorrow.  Mom?! Dad?!  What-what what you guys doing here?!
I certainly see what the girls like coming here. <+++++> Why?!
The sexy blonde behind the counter. <+++++> Gunther?!
Your mother just added him to her list. <+++++> What? Your-your list?
Yeah, the list that -of people we're allowed to sleep <+++++> Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know I 'm looking for him?
Anything? <+++++> No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn 't heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandler's parents again!
You told them he was missing? <+++++> No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I 'm interested in them.
All right, we 've got to tell her he's gone. <+++++> No! Hey! Hey! We can 't!
Ross, she 's gonna start getting ready soon! <+++++> Well, can 't you at least stall her a little? I'll-I'll go back to some of the places I went last night.
All right, well how much time do you need? <+++++> Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
One hour. <+++++> Give me two.
Then why do you ask?! <+++++> Okay, wish me luck.
Okay. I 'm going with you. <+++++> Why?!
Oh my God! Is that him? <+++++> That is an old, Chinese woman!
He could be in disguise, y 'know. <+++++> Aw, y 'know Y'know, maybe we're-we're just approaching this all wrong. If you're Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you'd go?
Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I 'm related to Monica. How is she? <+++++> She 's fine. She doesn't know you're gone. And she doesn't have to know, okay? Now come on, we're going home.
Because if I go home, we 're gonna become the Bings! I can't be the Bings! <+++++> What 's wrong with being the Bings?
The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games! <+++++> Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
No. <+++++> Then you are neither of your parents!
I want to. I love her so much, but I 'm afr It's too huge. <+++++> Y 'know, okay. You're right. It is huge. So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
Well yeah, but then <+++++> Yeah -No-but-but-but-but! We're just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that's not scary right?
No. <+++++> I 'm telling you, just a little bit at a time.
Yeah okay. Well, what 's the next little bit? <+++++> Getting married.  Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that too! Just like you 've done everything else!
Yeah. You 're right. Hey I-I can do that. <+++++> Yeah.
Okay, excuse me for a minute. <+++++> Wh -Hey-Whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!
Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air. <+++++> Okay.
I thought he was with you. <+++++> He-he was with me umm, we 're playing a little game, y'know? Hide and seek.
You can 't ask us son, that's cheating. <+++++> You 're right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.
Honey, it isn 't good luck. <+++++> Oh my God! Monica!
I know! Hey, how 's Chandler doin'? <+++++> Great. He 's doing great. Don't you worry about Chandler.
Are you okay? <+++++> Uh-huh.

Oh that 's sweet. Don't touch me. <+++++> Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
What 's going on? <+++++> Chandler 's gone again!
Hey! Oh! <+++++> You 're not getting away this time mister! Unless you want that ass kicking we talked about!
Ross! <+++++> Hiiii-Ya!!  I 'm serious! You're not walking out on my sister!
That 's right! I'm not! <+++++> Then where the hell have you been?!
You know?! <+++++> What?
Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking. <+++++> What?! What?! Talking about what?!
You don 't know? <+++++> Know what -If somebody doesn't tell me what's going on right now

Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes <+++++> Cigarettes?!!
But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she 'd know I was okay. <+++++> Dude.

What? Wha-wha-wha-did you do ROSS! <+++++> oh boy you got mad at that part. I went over there to tell him how great you are but you know me BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, and I ended up telling him that.
WHAT! <+++++> umm. that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named Vicrum.
WHAT! WHY? <+++++> well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in a serious relationship.
If you hadn't just had a baby with my best friend I swear to Lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your danglers RIGHT NOW! <+++++> well Phoebe, I think you'll feel better when you know a little bit about Vicrum, His a Kite designer  and he used to date Oprah.
I'm not going along with some lie you made Ross, No I'm just gonna be honest with him. <+++++> Good yeah just be honest with him.
yeah I've nothing to be ashamed of ok so I haven't been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. Ok I haven't had a real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave. which he will and that's ok. so I'll just be alone forever you know alright I'll be. it'll be fine. it'll be fine. I'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians. Oh <+++++> I'll get it
Definitely <+++++> This is Vicrum.
I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas. <+++++> You're really not coming back?
Yeah, I can't wait to go back to work. <+++++> I can't get enough dinosaurs!
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth. <+++++> You got me a cola drink?
And, a lemon lime. <+++++> Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.
Cool! <+++++> Yeah!
Come on Ben. <+++++> Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
Hey! <+++++> What are you doing here, Santa?
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man? <+++++> I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say. <+++++> What are you doing?
You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work! <+++++> Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.
Why? <+++++> Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.
But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly. <+++++> I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.
Uhh, uh... <+++++> Answer faster, answer faster!
I don't know! <+++++> Answer better, answer better!
Oohh, I love it! <+++++> Really? You're not gonna return it?
Oh wow, it's so beautiful... <+++++> Wow, it really is!
Hey! <+++++> Oh my god...
What? <+++++> What, you, you really quit your job?
Here, pass these, will ya.. <+++++> Oh, hey...
Oh, hey... <+++++> "A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet." -- How did you know?
Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK. <+++++> I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.
And the fact that they're both monkeys. <+++++> Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.
Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding. <+++++> Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.
Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake? <+++++> Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.
Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question. <+++++> Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.
Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on. <+++++> Oh my God, what happened?
Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died. <+++++> I can't believe this.
I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today. <+++++> Well, ya know, someone should have called me.
I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture. <+++++> Zoo dollars?
I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me? <+++++> I was thinkin' about it.
Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes. <+++++> Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars?
Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe. <+++++> Buddy, my monkey?
Oh, yeah, right. There was a break-in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey was taken. <+++++> Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.
The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya? <+++++> That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.
Of course they're gonna say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity. It's all a great big cover-up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes? <+++++> That guy Lipson?
Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows? <+++++> No, I, I only know Lipson.
Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with... <+++++> Buddy, my monkey, my monkey.
Word on the street - well, when I say street, I mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo. <+++++> Of course.
Your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. That's all I know. <+++++> This is unbelievable.
So, what is this information worth to you, my friend? <+++++> Are you trying to get me to bribe you?
Maybe. <+++++> But you already told me everything.
Well, so what're you gonna do? <+++++> Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.
OK, hi again. <+++++> Hi Phoebe.
Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God. <+++++> Well, there goes my whole belief system.
I'm not Drake. <+++++> That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin.
This is amazing. <+++++> I know.
C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon. <+++++> Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?
I'm sorry guys, closed set. <+++++> Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together.
Ross, there he is. <+++++> Hey, hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel.
Woah, dude, burn. <+++++> I don't get it, he seemed so happy to see me yesterday.
In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepard. <+++++> Woah.
You're blowin' me off for a monkey? <+++++> Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday.
Oooh. <+++++> With mealworms.
Chandler's wearing panties. <+++++> What? Let me see.
No, no, you don't have to see. <+++++> Hi Tushie.
Hey, hey, and I'm in the movie. <+++++> What happened?
One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, I'm dying on the gurney. Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want to go down there and say goodbye. <+++++> Ahh, oh that's OK, I mean, he's probably got, you know, parties to go to and stuff. But, ya know, he's moved on. Hey, that, that's the way it goes right.
All right! Who's are they? Who's are they? <+++++> Well, they're not mine!
See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's! <+++++> Why are they here?
This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish. <+++++> Hi.
What's wrong buddy? <+++++> Someone at work ate my sandwich!
Well, what did the police say? <+++++> My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!
Ross, it's just a sandwich! <+++++> Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but <+++++> That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.
Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street. <+++++> Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh,  "Keep your mitts off my grub?"
Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff. <+++++> Whoa! Ohh!!
Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you! <+++++> Phoebe!
Yeah? <+++++> Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.
Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller. <+++++> That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want.  Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee! Now!
Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you? <+++++> Yeah, of course, Donald.
We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part. <+++++> What?!
Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently people now call you mental. <+++++> Yeah.
We want you to speak to a psychiatrist. <+++++> Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.
A sandwich? <+++++> Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here
Oh, you know what? <+++++> What?
I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that. <+++++> You ate my sandwich?
It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone. <+++++> Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?
No. <+++++> Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?
There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind. <+++++> That said it was my sandwich?!
Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash. <+++++> What?
Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away. <+++++> You-you-you-you  threw my sandwich away!
Ross? <+++++> Hey Chandler.  Monica!
Ross, are you okay? <+++++> I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
Why?! <+++++> On account of my rage.
Which I may say, right now, is out of control. <+++++> He gave me a pill for it.
A pill? <+++++> Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.
And you're okay with that? <+++++> I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!! <+++++> What's going on?
Look! <+++++> Dude! That's my sister!
Well, what is the truth? <+++++> Yeah, what's going on?
Oh no! <+++++> You slept with my sister?
Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London. <+++++> This is not good for my rage.
I guess I wanted to keep it  as a souvenir. <+++++> My God Monica!!
But sadly I could not be enticed. <+++++> Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island? <+++++> Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.
Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island. <+++++> Also an island.
Hey, what time is it? <+++++> 2
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour? <+++++> Are you serious?!
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it. <+++++> Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Is Monica here? <+++++> No.
All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl. <+++++> You bought Shawn Cassidy!
Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready? <+++++> Yeah!
Okay!  Check it out! <+++++> What-what is it?!
Yes it is! <+++++> Why is it inside out?!
Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat! <+++++> How much did you pay for that?
Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal. <+++++> Yeah? How much?
A thousand bucks. <+++++> ON A CAT??!!!!
All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it! <+++++> Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}
Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson.  Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?! <+++++> Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
Uhh, the ball thing. <+++++> Yeah?
Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?! <+++++> Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!
Uh-oh. <+++++> What?
Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it! <+++++> I know!  Don't switch hands, okay?
All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work! <+++++> How do you know? You don't have a watch.
What?! <+++++> Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!
Yeah, we haven't dropped it in <+++++> 2 hours, 27 minutes.
I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good.   Yes!!   Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not. <+++++> Hey Rach!
Hey. <+++++> Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat. <+++++> Yeah.
You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying,  "Rachel!" <+++++> Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
I'm not a dropper! <+++++> It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?
It's throwing and catching! <+++++> All right.
I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing! <+++++> Baking it didn't help, huh?
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay! <+++++> Congratulations! Congrats!
No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they? <+++++> Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!
Not fun anymore? <+++++> I'm still hungry!
All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me? <+++++> I am!
It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken.  Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson. <+++++> Oh, thank God!
Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long. <+++++> I know. My arm is killing me.
Hey man, what's up? <+++++> Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow.
Ooh, Ross, look! Look! <+++++> What? Where?
Right over there! Right there! Look-look-look! <+++++> What am I looking at?
I want to go on a ride along! <+++++> Me too!
Okay, you guys free tonight? <+++++> Yeah!!
Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita? <+++++> Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!
It is starting to get dark out there. <+++++> He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!
Okay.  But it is officially nighttime. <+++++> Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?
It's called the cherry. <+++++> It's the -Chandler!!
It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that! <+++++> Yeah, no one talks like that!
Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop! <+++++> Hey, I'm more cop than you two!
How do you figure that? <+++++> Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay. <+++++> Umm, jealous!
Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here. <+++++> Yeah, no problem.
Ross! <+++++> Sorry! Sorry! Oh,  there!  Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!
No. But that reminds me,  sign this. <+++++> What is it?
Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?! <+++++> What? What? What? What is it?
You okay man? <+++++> Uh-huh. Thank Joey!
Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message. <+++++> Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye!
No, Joey! <+++++> Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car
Okay, go ahead. <+++++> Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
It was a car backfire! <+++++> Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!
Yeah, I didn't know that. <+++++> And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
Who jumps at loud noises! <+++++> Wow! I could've died tonight.
Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. <+++++> I do have a newfound respect for life.
Bye! <+++++> Bye!
Hey! Hi! <+++++> Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister! <+++++> Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh!
Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross? <+++++> The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!
What?! What? What happened?! <+++++> Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?
Yeah! <+++++> And somebody took a shot at me!
Really?! <+++++> No, a car backfired, but  I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
Because a car backfired? <+++++> Okay, why are you here?
Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole  "seizing" thing but um, Emily called you today. <+++++> You talked to her?
No, she left a message.   But it-it kinda got erased. There's just  something wrong with your machine. <+++++> Well, okay, what-what did she say?
Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her. <+++++> Wow!
Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right? <+++++> Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!
Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because -I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me-not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right.   Your decision. <+++++> Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.
Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that? <+++++> Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!
Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience! <+++++> You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?
Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff. <+++++> Huh.
I mean, look-look today you escaped   death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily? <+++++> That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.
Well, there you go! <+++++> Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.
Close call day. <+++++> Hey, thanks Rach.
Ohh, honey no problem. Okay. <+++++> Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.
Oh? <+++++> "Hey Ross, it's you!"  Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.
No. <+++++> Hey umm, was-was Monica here?
Yeah. <+++++> Yeah, I want my money back.
Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story. <+++++> I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but- but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
Before or after you were shot by your own troops? <+++++> I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us. <+++++> I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
Does anyone wanna watch TV? <+++++> Yeah, sure.
Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong? <+++++> Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.
Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything. <+++++> I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you? <+++++> Oh God, no.
Oh, let's not tell this story. <+++++> Oh, come on!
Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say,  "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut buash?" <+++++> Yeah that's the same.
Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it? <+++++> Which one?
You too sweethart! <+++++> Hey!
Oh my! <+++++> Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!
Ross! <+++++> Oh, this is Monica.
I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so I hope you're hungry. <+++++> Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
dammit! <+++++> So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since I've been away at college.
Oh! No, not really. <+++++> Well, that's cool. So did
Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly.  Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men! <+++++> Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.
Call them mom and dad you loser! <+++++> Monica!
Emotional Knapsack? <+++++> Yeah.
Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don 't take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez. <+++++> Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I 'm gonna be out with her all night.
Dude, don't do that too me! <+++++> All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister. <+++++> Hey!
Oh, I can't believe you called her fat. <+++++> I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
Hey! <+++++> Hey.  Happy Thanksgiving!
Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look. <+++++> So uh, where's Monica?
You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body! <+++++> Dude!
Yes, yes Monica is thin. It's wonderful. But what we really want to hear about is Ross's new girlfriend. <+++++> Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!
Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot. <+++++> Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe, you just said it!
Chandler! <+++++> Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that.
No it is awesome! <+++++> Hi guys.
Wow! Hey, why are you all dressed up? <+++++> Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn't she look cute?
Well, because if one more person says "what a cute little boy" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna! <+++++> I think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? She's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts. Can I get a blue bow?
That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl. <+++++> Yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread.
I'm the hell person whose office this is! <+++++> Good one, Rach.
Excuse me? <+++++> Rach we have a code brown situation.
Can you please, please take care of it for me? <+++++> Alright, but you have to do one sometime.
Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me. <+++++> What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even...
Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out. <+++++> What about Emma? We don't have a nanny.
I know. You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today? <+++++> Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.
Come on, I don't know what else to do. <+++++> Fine, fine.  We'll have fun, won't we? Yes, we will, yes we will.
Ross? <+++++> Huh?
Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family. <+++++> So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now?
Yeah. <+++++> Good-bye.
Yeah, Ross is here so... <+++++> Yeah, and I was really hoping that I could hang out. What do you feel like doing?
We're gonna have sex. <+++++> I don't feel like having sex. Maybe we can watch a movie or something.
Let me put it this way. We're having sex whether you're here or not. <+++++> Pants off Bing!
Hey. <+++++> You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.
Hi, good morning lover. I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees. <+++++> Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!
What!? You faked it? <+++++> You know what? I don't need a tie. I mean, it's better, open collar. You know, it's more casual
Oh, Rachel! <+++++> Actually, um, I was thinking maybe both of us could go.
Oh, yay! <+++++> Thanks, I put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift.
Okay, well that's now the third sign that I should not leave Emma. <+++++> Oh, what were the other two?
Well, let's see. The first one is <+++++> I know, it's the first time, we're leaving the baby and hey, I know how hard it is for you, but but Emma is gonna be fine. My mom is gonna be with her. She's great with kids.
She is? <+++++> Ya.
What about  Monica. <+++++> Hey, you only heard Monica's side of that. That little fatso was a terror.
Ish. I just don't think I can bear it. <+++++> Rachel, I know that you can. And you should.
Uch. <+++++> Really, it would be good for you and in fact, why don't you, why don't you go ahead to the restaurant and I will wait for my mom and then I'll meet you there.
Oh-A. <+++++> No, no, really. You should go. Just go! Go! Go out! Really, the world is your oyster. Kick up the heels. Paint the town red.
You need to learn some new slang. <+++++> I'm serious. C'mon, you should go. Here.  No, uh-uh, just go.
What Oh! <+++++> No! No, you know what?  You
I was just going to say that I left my keys. <+++++> Oh,  holy molly are we in a pickle now.
No. Uch. <+++++> Oh-oh, wait, my mother is gonna be here any minute. And she has the keys.
Alright, I can't, I can't wait that long. You have to do something-knock that door down! <+++++> I would, but I bruise like a peach. Besides, y you know, everything is gonna be fine. The baby's sleeping.
What if she jumped out the bassinet? <+++++> Can't hold her own head up, but yeah jumped.
Oh my god, I left the water running. <+++++> Rach you did not leave the water running. Please, just pull yourself together, okay?
Ah, did I leave the stove on? <+++++> You never cooked since 1996.
Is the window open? Because if there's a window open, a bird could fly in there. <+++++> Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think you're right. I think listen, listen!
Ubb. <+++++> A pigeon, a pigeon.  No, no wait, no-no, an eagle flew in. Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird's aid. The eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon. Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still up lays  are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the apartment.
Och, god.  Oh, thank god, you're okay. I'm so sorry we left you. Mom never gonna leave you again. Never ever ever again. Uch. <+++++> Great. So let's get going?
I understand, separation is hard. One time I was about to leave Ross to go to the beauty parlor and he got so upset, he took off all his clothes, tucked his ??? between his legs and cried out <+++++> Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.
Oh, uh, again. Can I make a special request <+++++> Hey, hi, hi!
You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two? <+++++> I'm so sorry
That's a great story-can I eat it? <+++++> And then Rachel wasn't sure she could leave the baby.
Oh honey, this is for the best, thus I'm not distracted, worrying about Emma, how she's doing at home and I'm being completely here with you and, oh, she spit up! <+++++> What?
She spit up. Judy! She spi Judy! Look alive, Judy!  Thank you. <+++++> Thanks. Oh.
Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman. <+++++> Y'know this ??? is incredible.
Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach. <+++++> Okay, I'll have the fixed salad and the duck.
Why are you going? He said, she wanted the shrew! <+++++> Rach, c'mon, Emma is fine. You're turning into an obsessive mother. Okay, you need to stop.
You mean the lully story? <+++++> Huh-huh, they already know it.
Could you please get her attention? <+++++> W-oa Mommy!
Oh, for god's sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock!  I'm sorry, was that rude? Di- did my, my li-little outburst blunt  the hideousness  that is this evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didn't even have the courtesy to call.  Well, it's too late now. <+++++> Well, ??? think that's us?
Oh thank god, if Phoebe's going, can we please take Emma home? <+++++> You know, I think that's a good idea-our babysitter just pounded in another Chardonnet.  Bye, y'guys.
Hey! <+++++> Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I 'd take that bad boy out for a little spin.
Yeah, well he 's my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it. <+++++> It 's a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won 't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver. There! That wasn't about the wedding. <+++++> Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I 'll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
Take the top down did ya? <+++++> Only way to fly.
Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she 's talking about! I am an excellent driver! <+++++> You 're fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader. <+++++> Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must 've seen me cruising in the bad boy.
I think she 's checking out your beehive Ross. <+++++> What?!  Give-give me a brush.
Gimme the keys! <+++++> No way!
Well no brush! <+++++> Fine! Y 'know what? It doesn't matter, because, if I remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.
My God! <+++++> What do you think you 're doing?!
Just washing the windshield. <+++++> There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don 't you just hand over the keys?
She puts the key into the ignition, which is on the left side of the steering wheel. Does anyone know why that is? It's a tradition left over from Porsche's racing history. The world's greatest endurance race is the 24 Hours of LeMans. Which is in France and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on Saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on Sunday.  In the 60s LeMans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track. At the start of the race, the drivers would run across the track, get in the car, buckle up, start the car, and drive off. Porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took. Since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel, that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat-belts, put the car in gear and start it. The driver's left hand did nothing. Porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24-hour race; moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat-belts with his right hand. That's why every Porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel.} <+++++> No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car!  Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now!
Look Ross, if you 're so freaked out, just get in the car! <+++++> With you?! Yeah right!
All right. <+++++> Okay! Okay! Okay!
What are you doing?! Get in the front! <+++++> In the death seat?!!
God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed. <+++++> You don 't have a valid driver 's license-Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
Oh Ross you 're so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax <+++++> What-what are you doing?! Are you -Okay that's not funny! Just stop horsing around!
Uh-oh. <+++++> Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.
Really? You think so? <+++++> I was talking to myself! You 're going down!
Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I 'll go under, you go over! <+++++> Yeah, I 'll get right on that.
Oh come on Ross!! <+++++> No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, I 'm sure we won't get arrested for this.
Hi officer, was I going a little too fast? <+++++> Oh my God.
Oops sorry, my mistake. <+++++> Dear Lord!!
Wow! <+++++> Here it comes.
Yeah? Well you look phenomenal. <+++++> Well she should, it was taken ten years ago!
Oh well <+++++> I can handle the stick!!
Remind me to introduce you to someone! <+++++> Who?
Fourth gear!! <+++++> What?! What does he want?! I wasn 't doing anything!
Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o 'clock position. <+++++> Maybe it 's uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more!
It 's a different guy! <+++++> Good evening officer.
Do you know how fast you were traveling back there? <+++++> Ah no. I don 't, but it could not have been more than sixty.
You 're right. It was 37. <+++++> I mean you 're not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are ya?
That 's right. <+++++> Y 'know of-officer I uh I had the weirdest dream last night
Your license please. <+++++> You don 't-you don't want to hear about my dream Officer Pretty?
You have a son! <+++++> I know. I know.
Oh, let me see!  Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over! <+++++> That would be nice.
Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research. <+++++> What kind of research?
Oh, just, y'know.... science. <+++++> Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that.
Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars. <+++++> Hey.
Hey. <+++++> Hey.
How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last? <+++++> I'm going to China.
You're going to China? <+++++> Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the bo -it's-it's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary . Um... here's a picture of me...
Oh, let me see! <+++++> 
Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh....  Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun. <+++++> Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.
Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl. <+++++> Oh.  Hey, who's Carl?
You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse. <+++++> No.
Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the... <+++++> At the coffeehouse, right.
So you do know who he is!  Sorry. <+++++> OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys.
Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story. <+++++> Hi.
Hey! <+++++> ....I have to go to China.
The country? <+++++> No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?
Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no. <+++++> Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
Course there, they just call it food. <+++++> Yeah... I guess. I don't -I don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK?
Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you. <+++++> I know.
Alright! <+++++> Ni-chou chi-ma!
I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy! <+++++> I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here. <+++++> Fine, just stop thinking about me.
Fine, just stop thinking about me. <+++++> Can't do it, can you?
So I'm thinking about you. So what? <+++++> I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car! <+++++> Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
Ross, it's too hard. <+++++> No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.
Ross, you're like my best friend. <+++++> I know.
If we broke up, and I lost you... <+++++> Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?
Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up? <+++++> No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?
I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before. <+++++> Well, start looking.
For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel! <+++++> Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
Oh, thanks, sweetie. <+++++> No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
Really? <+++++> Yeah.
You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me? <+++++> No, no, they will. I just... uh...
Can't wait. <+++++> Come on, they're gonna love you.
Hey, look, you guys, I'm going for anything here, OK? I cannot be a waitress anymore, I mean it. I'm sick of the lousy tips, I'm sick of being called 'Excuse me...' <+++++> Rach, did you proofread these?
Uh... yeah, why? <+++++> Uh, nothing, I'm sure they'll be impressed with your excellent compuper skills.
Hey, guys. <+++++> Hey.
You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again? <+++++> I don't know.
Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing? <+++++> No, it's not just that. It's just -I want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh...
...little playthings with yarn? <+++++> What?
Could you want her more? <+++++> Who?
Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening. <+++++> Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just...
Hi! How are you? <+++++> We're fine, we're fine.
What? <+++++> Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright? <+++++> Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'
Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play? <+++++> No, women are welcome to play.
I mean, that's a typical guy response. <+++++> Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs. <+++++> No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can't -you can't do...
Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here! <+++++> No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that.
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours. <+++++> Oh, you're...
Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks... <+++++> Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...
The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so... <+++++> The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.
And you know what? We want a rematch. <+++++> Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
 <+++++> ...Yeah.
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less. <+++++> Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt...
...Yeah? <+++++> I'm not a nice guy.
Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria? <+++++> You still on that?
Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? <+++++> You are way off, pal.
No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her. <+++++> Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one time -not any more. I just-I...
Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one time -not any more. I just-I... <+++++> Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
Marcel! Where are you going with that disc? <+++++> You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OK -if you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble.
Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else? <+++++> Alright.
Alright. <+++++> I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
Hi! <+++++> Hey.
Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, and -oh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well! <+++++> That's great! That's wonderful!
Yes, we should. I think we should. <+++++> Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?
No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go. <+++++> Alright.
That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie. <+++++> Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
Excuse me, where are you going? <+++++> Uh... to the bathroom.
Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker? <+++++> I want to go to the bathroom.
Yes!  .... or no. <+++++> Alright.
Me too. Alright, whattaya got. <+++++> Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush.
Ross? <+++++> Oh, I am very in.
Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you.  What do you say... want to waste another buck? <+++++> No, not this time.  So... what'd you have?
I'm not telling. <+++++> Come on, show them to me.
No..! <+++++> Show them to me!
Get your hands out of there! No! <+++++> Let me see! Show them!
Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants. <+++++> First of all, I'm not losing...
Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing. <+++++> Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the...
Hel-lo, Rachel Green. <+++++> Mee mee, mee-mee mee.
Check. <+++++> I'm in for fifty cents.
I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars. <+++++> I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.
 <+++++> No, I fold.
What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it? <+++++> I'm in.
How many you want? <+++++> One.
Dealer takes two.  What do you bet? <+++++> I bet two dollars.
OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty. <+++++> I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five.
...teen! <+++++> 
 <+++++> Fifteen.
Here, I got five, I got five. <+++++> Thank you.
Good luck. <+++++> 
Full house. <+++++> You got me.
 <+++++> Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know.  But, uh... look how happy she is.
Go. <+++++> Uh.... bean! Bean!
Hey guys! <+++++> Hey!
Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday! <+++++> Yeah!
Well, can't you just have the party when we get back? <+++++> No.
Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was! <+++++> C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.
Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day? <+++++> Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.
Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food! <+++++> Hey guys!
Hi! <+++++> Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.
Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule! <+++++> Yeah!
Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people! <+++++> That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?
Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon. <+++++> Ah, and where is Joey?
I said it's still nap time. <+++++> Hey, there is uncle Joey!
Hey! <+++++> Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!
18, uh? <+++++> Joey, NO!
What, what!? it's for her hot friends! <+++++> When they see this you'll be 52!
HI! <+++++> Hey!
I remember your first birthday! Ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you. He pulled on his testicles so hard! We had to take him to the emergency room! <+++++> There's something you didn't know about your dad!
All right, let 's get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us. <+++++> Oh, great!
Wow! That was amazing! <+++++> Thank you so much for that gift!
I was not ready for this today! <+++++> Amazing... amazing.
Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too! <+++++> Ok, cut! Great. That was... that was just... yeah!
Ross, um, don 't forget to get a shot of Emma's cake. It's in a box in the fridge. <+++++> Sure.
Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny. <+++++> Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?
I know what you're thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny! <+++++> I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.
No, no, this is not what I ordered. Ok? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for my daughter 's birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now! <+++++> Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby 's face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. . That is a weird sentence!
To be fair this one does have nuts. <+++++> Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.
Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key! <+++++> Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh?  Ok!
And you know, I have a massage client soon. <+++++> You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?
Alright, 5 more minutes. <+++++> Hello?  Oh no! What happened?  Ok ok, where are you? . Ok, I'll be right there.
Was that Emma? Is she up? <+++++> No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.
No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us  We've been complaining the longest! <+++++> No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?
I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday! <+++++> Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves!
No, there isn't time to go to the bakery. We're just gonna come home... Everybody left? Alright, well just tell Emma we're gonna be there as soon as we can.  Bye... <+++++> RACHEL!
OOH! God! Sorry! <+++++> I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver.
Emma's awake. <+++++> Yeah?
I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake. <+++++> Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else.
Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me. <+++++> Rach, she's not going to remember this.
I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing  "Happy Birthday". Then we would all go into... HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!!  They have to learn! <+++++> Hey!
What? <+++++> It's not bad.
Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that? <+++++> Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.
Well, I'm very impressed. <+++++> Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.
I've been here the whole time! <+++++> Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.
Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many! <+++++> Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means...
NO, no science camp! <+++++> Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake.
Thanks! <+++++> Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma.
Let's do it, come on! <+++++> What's wrong? Are you okay?
Okay. <+++++> Okay, you ready?
Yeah. <+++++> A-a-and... record.
Ross, how about you. What would you give up, sex or food? <+++++> Food.
Ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs? <+++++> Oh my God. It's like Sophie's Choice.
Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can't believe he would do this to Monica! <+++++> I know, and with the baby coming?
So, should we tell her? <+++++> I don't know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?
Why? Who'd you seen him with? <+++++> No one, I'm just saying if...
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW! <+++++> I know nothing! Mike's a great guy, it was hypothetical!
All right. . He is a good guy. You're right, he wouldn't cheat. <+++++> Believe me, if I did see with someone, there 's no way I...
All right... <+++++> We think Chandler might be having an affair.
Who's Nancy? <+++++> What's going on?
So you're gonna move? <+++++> Oh my God.
...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by. <+++++> So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?
Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door? <+++++> You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.
No, no, it's not, don't listen to him!  I'm gonna thump you! <+++++> It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.
Actually, we already found a house we love. <+++++> What?
Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh? <+++++> You put an offer on a house?
Yeah, but so is this. <+++++> Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy! <+++++> You can see where he'd have trouble.
Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica... <+++++> That money is mine, Green!
Deal! <+++++> What was Monica's nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Big fat goalie. <+++++> Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movieÃ¢ÂÂ¦
Dangerous Liaisons. <+++++> Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
Weekend at Bernie's. <+++++> Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
Fancy guest. <+++++> Two seconds...
Uhh, 11! <+++++> 11, unbelievable, 11 is correct.
11, unbelievable, 11 is correct. <+++++> Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl's breast?
14? <+++++> No, 19.
Thanks man. <+++++> Joey had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
Maurice. <+++++> Correct, his profession was?
Space cowboy! <+++++> Correct! What is Chandler Bing's job?
Ow...Oh Gosh! <+++++> 10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
Well it stupid, unfair question! <+++++> Don't blame the questions!
Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us! <+++++> Chandler!!! Chandler!!!  Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
Hey Ross. What's up bro? <+++++> What the hell are doing?!!
Dude! He's right there! <+++++> I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too. <+++++> My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this.
Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked. <+++++> That's so sweet.
That's so sweet. <+++++> And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters. <+++++> You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good.
I'm really sorry you guys. <+++++> Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window.
Yeah, we'll be okay. <+++++> Love you guys.
I know. <+++++> I love this.
A meatball Sub? Thanks! <+++++> Seriously you guys, what's going on? What are these for?
Hey... <+++++> Hey!
Hi! <+++++> Pheebs, what's wrong?
Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this...  HUGE engagement ring! <+++++> OH!
Congratulations! Wow!! <+++++> So, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared, or  did he cry?  Yeah, big surprise, I like proposals!
Well, hey! Well...  Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and...  I wanna say Mike?  To Phoebe and Mike! <+++++> Whoo!
Hey! <+++++> Guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant! I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you.
Ah, well, unless it's the creepy guy with his hand up his kilt, I'm gonna say congratulations! <+++++> Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not that I'm keeping score or anything... five!
Wow, that's great! So, tell me about the grant! <+++++> Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the  "Paleontology Review"! Yeah! That'll be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious questions about my work!
Wait. Are you talking about the Dewar grant? <+++++> Yeah. Why?
Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant. <+++++> Your ex-boyfriend?
Yeah. <+++++> So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!
No, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, if anything, I think this could help you. You know what? Why don't we all go out to dinner together, and I can introduce you. <+++++> Well, if you think it would help.
Yes, absolutely. I'll call him. <+++++> Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know, butter him up? Anything he really likes?
Mmh... he does have a pretty serious latex fetish. <+++++> We'll see how dinner goes.
Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning! <+++++> Well, I... I am having a good hair day.
Me too. <+++++> I'm ok.
I'm sorry...  Ross Geller... Benjamin Hobart. <+++++> It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize,  whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into the field.
You weren't there! <+++++> No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... tzz-zzz, mmm.
So, tell me about it. <+++++> Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.
M-m. <+++++> See, there are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated.
Break up with Charlie! <+++++> What?
What? <+++++> Did you just say  "break up with Charlie"?
Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I didn't not say it. <+++++> Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?
I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting to realize how much I missed her, and I'm gonna need you to break up with her. <+++++> Are you serious?
If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then I'm joking! <+++++> No!
Interesting. <+++++> I guess!
Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday? <+++++> What? I... I...
Care to venture a guess? <+++++> May 12th?
Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit was later covered by a popular British invasion band? <+++++> Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.
No! I'm sorry, we were looking for  "Baby It's You". Baby It's You. <+++++> Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my questions have anything to do with Paleontology.
You're right, I apologize. Scratch the last question. Spell "Boscodictiasaur". <+++++> um... I've never heard of a  "Boscodictiasaur".
Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it. <+++++> Ok.  B - O - S ...
No, it starts with a silent  "M". <+++++> Oh come on!!
I've come here to apologize. I think I may have let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process. <+++++> No! Stop!
Anyway, I've decided to offer you the grant. <+++++> Really?
Well... there is just one small... stipulation... <+++++> I have to break up with Charlie?
Hey, you got one right! <+++++> You're crazy.
Crazy, or... romantic? <+++++> Crazy!
Ooor... <+++++> Get out!
Did you get the grant? <+++++> No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.
What? <+++++> Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't give you up.
Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up with me. And besides, he's a very ethical man. <+++++> Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of  "Underdog"?
I'm sure he was just joking, Ross. <+++++> If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.
Seriously? <+++++> Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?
Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then M-B-O... <+++++> Damnit!
Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are you doing here? <+++++> I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the voice of Underdog!
Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross, this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia. <+++++> No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.
Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in my life. <+++++> Too little, too late, Benji!
I never should have broken up with you. I think about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me? <+++++> No!
Yes! <+++++> What?
I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so.... romantic. <+++++> or...
Maybe... <+++++> Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.
I love you too! <+++++> Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!
Come on, it 's a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn't smoked since. <+++++> Pffhah.
What 's your problem? <+++++> Nothing, it 's just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City. <+++++> Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.
Oh, y'know what, I didn 't want cinnamon on this. <+++++> Sorry.
Oh, yeah! <+++++> Wow!
What, he 's 18. <+++++> Exactly, it 'll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.
If that doesn 't keep kids in school, what will? <+++++> And so now you guys are gonna be married?
No, I know, I know, that this is Frank 's life,  y'know. Y'know, I don't want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it's sick and wrong! <+++++> Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?
Yes. Not out loud. <+++++> Pheebs, if you don 't tell him, soon he's gonna be married, and then you're gonna hate yourself.
Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he 's gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can't.  But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it. <+++++> No-no-no-no-no.
Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?! <+++++> No.
Look, the point is, there 's a lot of women out there you haven't even had sex with yet! <+++++> Yeah, he-he 's right, he's right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you're young, you're-you're weird, chicks dig that.
Yeah, in a poem maybe. <+++++> No the man 's right, that's what I had with Rachel.
You don 't have it anymore? <+++++> No, I ah, I slept with someone else.
Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better? <+++++> It didn 't.
It 's so cool man, it's so, it's just 'cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her. <+++++> Yeah, yeah.
Why can 't I find that? <+++++> Don 't ask me, I had it and I blew it!
I don 't know, maybe I can't. I mean, maybe there's something wrong with me. <+++++> Oh, no! No!
Well then,  what about you?! Huh?! <+++++> I 'm the ring bearer.
Hey! <+++++> Hi!
And that 's why, I'm not inviting you in for a drink.  Bye. <+++++> Oh-no-no-no-no .
Rehearse it! <+++++> Hi!
Thanks for coming you guys. <+++++> Oh,  hey, oh... I... I was-I was going for a hand shake.
Is that why your hand is pressed against my crotch? <+++++> That is why!
You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow. <+++++> Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?
Uh... November? <+++++> I wanna say it's not looking good.
Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding. <+++++> What?
I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were-you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut. <+++++> Oh, man!
This is like figure skating team all over again.  I mean synchronized swimming.  I mean- I mean the balance beam.  Help me! <+++++> FOOTBALL!
Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises! <+++++> I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.
I know, I hate being left out of things. <+++++> And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it...
What happened? <+++++> Who cares, AND?
...and I was wondering if... you know, maybe one of you guys... <+++++> I'll do it!
Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus. <+++++> No, Mike, no, no. You wanna pick me, I mean... watch!  Huh?
You know, I really don't feel very comfortable making this decision. You know, Phoebe knows you better, I'm gonna let her choose. <+++++> Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.
Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me! <+++++> Please, you're going down!
You are going downer! <+++++> Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike! <+++++> So, what did you decide?
All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid. <+++++> I'll do it!
Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer. <+++++> Hey!
Hi. <+++++> Where's Rach?
She's in her room, why? <+++++> I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! .  Oh! My God! You're breathtaking!
What d'you want? <+++++> You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?
Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is! <+++++> I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!
Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too! <+++++> Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!
Oh, you are the lesser of two evils! <+++++> YES, YES!
How's it going? <+++++> Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.
That's what I was doing too. <+++++> Well, you have fun tonight.
You too. <+++++> Oh, I will.
Me too. <+++++> Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you?
I'm not supposed to tell you. <+++++> I'm not supposed to tell you!
Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other. <+++++> Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again.
Oh, you haven't picked yet. Oh good, 'cause I had an idea. I thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog. Chappy. <+++++> What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose.
I don't think they are. <+++++> Haha! Looks like you're not going to be in the wedding either.  So sorry Pheebs.
Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl. <+++++> I can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today.
I guess. <+++++> I'll do it!
I'll do it! <+++++> No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you scared of dogs?
I'm not scared.  I'll just take little Chappy and...  HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED. <+++++> Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then. Ha haaa...  He stinks!
Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh... <+++++> Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free.
I'll do it. <+++++> I'll...
Geez Ross, you could have showered. <+++++> It's the dog.
I love you too. <+++++> Uh Joey...
Yeah? <+++++> Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.
I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to. <+++++> Come on Chappy, do your business. MAKE! MA-AKE! I did not sign on for this.
All right, so, so you went to Pete 's... <+++++> What happened?
He didn 't ask me to marry him. <+++++> Ohh.
So you can like, bite, and pull people 's hair and stuff? <+++++> Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
What 's fish hooking? <+++++> Huh, what 's fish hooking...   Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
All right buddy, way to go! <+++++> Dude, what are you doing?
Anything but stew. <+++++> All right so, Chandler, from now on, don 't give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don't turn your back to him.
God Ross, what is that? <+++++> Yeah, it 's the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!
Don 't worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent's strength and weight against him. <+++++> Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.
Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble. <+++++> All right! You go get him! Let 's go!
Hey. <+++++> Hey! How long until Pete 's fight?
Oh, about five minutes. Right now they 're interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves. <+++++> Hot dog?
So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie? <+++++> What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn 't expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now, but she's really terrific.
Ohh, that 's too bad! <+++++> No, I-I 'm saying I liked her.
Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea. <+++++> Pheebs, I think she 's great. Okay? We're going out again.
Hey! Which one 's my turkey burger? <+++++> Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
Hey, the fight 's starting! <+++++> Okay, we 'll be right in.  So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area. <+++++> Oh! Oh!
Wait, if that 's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it? <+++++> Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn 't want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can't.
Shhhh! <+++++> What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes. <+++++> What? That's like insanely easy!
It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose. <+++++> What? You forgot fourteen states?
Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game. <+++++> Wow, how many have you got?
Regular Celery!  Oh, I already have that. <+++++> Done! With time a-to-spare.
Oooh that may be a New World's record <+++++> You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called  "a globe?" Hmm?
Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states. <+++++> What? That's impossible.
I am only one man!  Okay Ross, time is up! <+++++> No, just give me another minute.
Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself. <+++++> This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.
Okay, but if you can't no dinner! <+++++> You're on!
Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay? <+++++> Pshhshhh!
Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk. <+++++> Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
Yeah, so she went back to Ohio. <+++++> Ohio!! Thank you!
Huh! Where is the dog?! <+++++> What dog? There-there's no dog here.
I have to! Okay? It's time!  Okay, I hate dogs. <+++++> What?
Are you crazy? <+++++> Are you out of your mind?
They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit. <+++++> Right, they are scary.  Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
You don't like ice cream? <+++++> It's too cold.
Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable. <+++++> It hurts my teeth.
1250. <+++++> Damn, I forgot you were here.
Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream! <+++++> Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom. <+++++> Yeah, but, but look what I'm...
Where's Monica? <+++++> Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.
Why not? <+++++> Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.
Well, I, I should go in there. <+++++> No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.
Why not? <+++++> Because you sent away the dog!
This is ridiculous. <+++++> Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend Phyllis take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.
Ross, you need some help? <+++++> From you?  Yes, please!
Thanks for having me over, you guys. <+++++> Tag? Y-You're going?  Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?
Colorado. <+++++> Ah, what good are you.
All right. <+++++> I want my turkey now!
You got it.  You got Nevada twice. <+++++> I know.
Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college. <+++++> She seems really , really fun!
They were lovers. <+++++> What?!
No we weren 't! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y 'know, ended up kissing for a bit. <+++++> So that 's two of my wives.
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head? <+++++> No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman 's tux!
What? <+++++> That 's right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film that Batman film he was in.
You can 't wear that! I'm wearing the famous tux! James Bond's tux! <+++++> So?
So -If you wear that you'll make mine less special. <+++++> Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you- you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.
Please, don 't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?! <+++++> Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.
Look, it 's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you. <+++++> When I got married you slept with my sister.
You just carry that around? <+++++> Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.
Between you and <+++++> Gunther.  Hey-hey! Why don 't we put them on? Y'know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.
A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants. <+++++> Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
Well, does that mean that you 're not going to wearing yours? <+++++> What are you kidding? It 's Batman's tux!!
Let me try it on! <+++++> Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin ' in there.
Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman!  What 's this? <+++++> What?
An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn 't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty- fruity love story where he played a blind guy! <+++++> Let me see that!  Oh man!
Hey! <+++++> Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?
Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who ever <+++++> OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?
No! <+++++> OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.
Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said <+++++> Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,
So are you gonna...talk to her? <+++++> Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!
You know when "That's fine" sounds true when someone yells it and spits! <+++++> No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You know
No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving? <+++++> I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.
Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life! <+++++> Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental
Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going? <+++++> Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times, <+++++> That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?
What are doing? You know I can only dish it out! <+++++> I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me
Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing <+++++> No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.
Did she go out with him? <+++++> No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.
Ah! The high road... <+++++> You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there!
Are you trying to get everybody divorced? <+++++> You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You...you break the
I thought I had to make the jokes! <+++++> Don't you have to be at work?
Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. <+++++> Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in Europe? Here's a question
You already hit on me an hour ago <+++++> Right, so that's a firm "no". I cannot believe this, I just keep striking out.
I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed <+++++> This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.
Well... <+++++> I know!
Thank you so much for letting me do this. Public bathrooms freak me out, I can't even pee, let alone do <+++++> But, what's great is that you don't mind talking about it.
It's so amazing I met you the same day that Eric broke up with me, because it's like you lose a boyfriend, <+++++> Uh-ah!
No don't worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally over Eric. <+++++> . Good choice Ross.
Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I've been looking for you everywhere! <+++++> Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am.
Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o' clock. So I was hoping you and I could have a <+++++> Oh, yeah, yeah that's Michelle.
Who? <+++++> Oh, just this woman I've been seeing.
You've being seeing someone? <+++++> Yeah, didn't I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we haven't being going out for too long, but rather there is this
What are you taking amoxicillin for? <+++++> How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that's
Ah, who is Emma? <+++++> I told you about my daughter.
Actually about an hour and a half. <+++++> I told you it wasn't long, but there is an amazing connection between us.
You feel that too? Oh, I thought that was just me! <+++++> Are you kidding?
Hey, do you want to go away this weekend? <+++++> We'll see.
Ok, Ross, what's going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now? <+++++> I don't know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?
How do you know about that? <+++++> Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to sleep...
Emma. <+++++> When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a guy you know, for what? A week?
No, actually, see I had to pee, 'cause I can't use public bathrooms because the doodie parasites. <+++++> Ok, Michelle, it's time to go.
Well, call me! <+++++> Ok.
No, wait, you don't have my phone number! <+++++> You know, if it's meant to be, I'll guess it. Bye, bye.
Score. <+++++> Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties on
Oh God, I can't believe you're making such a big deal about this. It was one kiss, one guy, one time! <+++++> Oh, really!
Yeah. <+++++> Oh, really!
Oh yeah. <+++++> What about the guy from the bar?
What? Who? <+++++> The guy you gave your number to.
Whoa, how do you know about that? <+++++> Because he called here looking for you. So don't tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,
Why didn't I get that message? <+++++> What?
From the guy in the bar, why didn't I get that message? <+++++> Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you not look there?
Ross? <+++++> I never gave it to you.
Why? <+++++> I don't know.
Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to decide what messages I should or should not get? <+++++> Who am I?
Yes. <+++++> I am the guy who's taking care of our baby while you're out at bars meeting guys!
Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you <+++++> None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That's not the point. Ok? The point is you...you are the one
Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What's wrong with us? You know when people hear about our situation they <+++++> Uh, clearly.
And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know, <+++++> Yeah, maybe not. So what you wanna do?
Hi. <+++++> Hi.
I just finished getting Phoebe all dressed to meet Mike's parents. She's so nervous, it's so sweet! <+++++> Guess what? I made Emma laugh today.
You WHAT? And I missed it? Because I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie? <+++++> Yeah, and it was uhm... it was like a real little person laugh too. It was... it was like uhm...  Only... only not creepy.
Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh? <+++++> I uhm... Well, I sang...  well actually I rapped... Baby Got Back...
You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses? <+++++> But you know what, if you think about it, it actually promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... juicy doubles.
owwwww... <+++++> Please don't take her away from me!
Okay... aahhh... Please laugh for mommy... Please? Please laugh for mommy...  Not funny huh? Oh so, is it... only offensive novelty rap? Or maybe just, you know, rap in general? 'Cause mommy can rap...  My name is mommy and I'm here to say / that all the babies are... Oh, I can't rap... Allright sweetheart... This is only because I love you so much, and I know that you're not gonna tell anybody...  I like... big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... / when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face...  Yes! Yes! Yes! YES! Oohhhhh! Oh!  I like big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... Oh Emma you're laughing! Oh you are, you really do like big butts, don't you. Oh you beautiful little weirdo... <+++++> Hey!
Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing. It was amazing. It was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that... <+++++> Oh I know, isn't it? Ooh... what'd you do to get her to laugh?
Oh! You know, I just... couple of things I tried ... I just sang a little doo... Itsy Bitsy Spider... <+++++> You sang Baby Got Back didn't you?
So fellas <+++++> Yeah!
fellas <+++++> Yeah!
has your girlfriend got the butt? <+++++> Hell yeah!
So shake it! <+++++> Shake it!
Shake it! <+++++> Shake it!
Shake that nasty butt... <+++++> Baby got back
One more time from the top... I like big butts and I cannot lie, you other br... <+++++> Rachel please! That is so inappropriate!
Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor! <+++++> Oh God, here we go!
What? <+++++> Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she like freaks out. Watch! Watch!
Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please? <+++++> All right, fine.
Monica! Come on! <+++++> Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I?
Ohh, give him a kiss for me! <+++++> All right, bye!
Bye! <+++++> Later!
Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come! <+++++> Hey!
Hey man, what's up? <+++++> Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?
Sure, what do you want to see? <+++++> I don't know, umm
Umm, no thank you. <+++++> What's with her?
I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay? <+++++> Okay.
What do you like better action or comedy? <+++++> Action.
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel? <+++++> Dude, you are sick.
Did you not hear the plot of the movie?  "She's been dead for ten years." I'm gonna be a millionaire! <+++++> Hey!
Hey! <+++++> I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.
You got it! <+++++> All right!
Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing! <+++++> Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading?  Pheebs?  Hello?  Phoebe?  Phoe-Phoebe!  Come on!
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there. <+++++> Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? 'Cause if are please, tell me what it is I did!
Well, if you don't know I can't help you. <+++++> Well, I don't know.
Well, I can't help you. <+++++> Well, whatever it is I'm-I'm very, very sorry. Okay?
Apology accepted. <+++++> Okay. So we're, we're good?
Uh-huh. <+++++> All right.  I'll uh, I'll see you later, okay?
Bye, fat ass. <+++++> ALL RIGHT!! Phoebe now come on! Will you please tell me what it is I did that mad you so mad at me!
I don't know! I don't remember! <+++++> Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?
No. <+++++> Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?
Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who! <+++++> Yeah? Sometimes it's
Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose. <+++++> Okay, I'm the baby.
Chandler! What are you doing here? <+++++> Hey!
Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge! <+++++> Why?!
Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison. <+++++> Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay, clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?
Uh-hmm. <+++++> What do you like better flora or fauna?
Fauna. <+++++> Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?
Garfunkle. <+++++> Why are you mad at me?
You said I was boring--Ohh! <+++++> When did I say you were boring?!
Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess! <+++++> Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that. <+++++> Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.
Art lover! <+++++> What'd you say?
I said art lover. <+++++> Is that supposed to be an insult?
I don't know, I'm very tired. <+++++> So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.
That sounds great. <+++++> Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines.
Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow!  Love to love ya, baby!  Darnit!  Ugh. <+++++> Hey.
Uh, yeah, if you want too. <+++++> Do you want me too?
Yeah, sure? <+++++> So do I.  Okay Rach, before anything happens  I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules.  This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of  "Us."  Okay? I just want this to be  about what it is!
And um, what-what is that Ross? <+++++> The physical act of love.
What?! Are you crazy? <+++++> Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
Oh God, you saw me?! Oh! <+++++> You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?! <+++++> No! No!  No!  No-no-no-no.
Ohh wow! I 'm sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes! <+++++> Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry. <+++++> Thank you.
Yes. <+++++> All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack.
Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love. <+++++> Yep! That's hilarious!
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done. <+++++> Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times. <+++++> Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily. <+++++> What?! You totally get embarrassed!
No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are. <+++++> Is that so?
Yeah. <+++++> Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom!
Hope you had a nice flight. <+++++> Ohh, it was the best!
Hey! <+++++> Phoebe!
What are you talking about Pheebs?  I don't   Oh my God, you drew on me?! <+++++> Hey, you wet my pants!
Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I can -you have so crossed a line. <+++++> Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way.
Ugh! <+++++> What?
That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing. <+++++> Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people.
M-M-Mole people? <+++++> What? No-no, a lurker.
Oh. What's a lurker? <+++++> Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits for you to give up and then
Kills you? <+++++> No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.
Ohhh! <+++++> Uh-hmm.
How do you know about this? <+++++> My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance -karate lessons.
Dance karate? <+++++> Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport.
All right, it won't come off! <+++++> What?!
It won't come off! <+++++> Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?
Hey-hey-hey you made it! <+++++> Joey!!
Who's your friend? He's hot! <+++++> Thanks man.
Hi. <+++++> Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie.
No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin! <+++++> Your what?
My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine! <+++++> What?! That's not gonna make you any money!
What?! What else did he say? <+++++> Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So  Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.
Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this! <+++++> Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.
Ross, I am a human doodle!! <+++++> Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you. Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here!  There are tons of freaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one will notice, I swear!
Okay, I need a, I need a drink! <+++++> Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff.  But who cares?! Because it's all on me!   That is, one big drink!
Macadamia nut? <+++++> Umm Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut!
Hm-mmm! <+++++> Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh?
Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel. <+++++> All right. Y'know what? We don 't have to go downstairs! We can bring Vegas up to us!  All right, come on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go.  13.
Hit me! <+++++> Oohh, 23.  Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars!
I bet 20. <+++++> You're right!
Hit me.  Hit me.  Hit me.  Hit me.  Hit me.  Hit me.  Hit me. <+++++> We need more cards.
Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second.  Whup, okay.  Hello! Vegas? Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? We would like some more beers. Hello? Ohh, I forgot to dial! <+++++> That must be our alcohol and beers!
Hey! <+++++> Ohh, it's Joey! I love Joey!
Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate! <+++++> I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man.   Whoa-oh-whoa! Are you, are you okay?
Ross, don't let her drink anymore! <+++++> Ohh, here's that Macadamia nut!
Ohhh!! <+++++> Nope! Something else.
Oops! All right, so what do you want to do now? <+++++> I wanna get out of the room! Y'know, I I really miss downstairs.
Good luck to ya! <+++++> Excuse me sir, you've got a little something right here.
Wow! <+++++> Hello!
Hello! <+++++> Hello!
Are you sure you wanna do this? <+++++> Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
Allright. Well thank you so much for coming... <+++++> Thank you.
Oh, you know, wait. I do have one question.  Do you guys do random drug testing? <+++++> Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.
Okidoki!  Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny. <+++++> Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews  And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with.
What, the blonde with no bra? <+++++> She was blonde?  Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years.
Hi... I'm Sandy. <+++++> And she's a little mannish...
Sandy, that's exactly what it is... <+++++> Are you gay?
Oh, that's pretty. <+++++> So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?
I realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people, but I really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is take care of a child. <+++++> Okay.
Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person... When I left, I said <+++++> Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap.
Oh, that would be great!  I love him, I love him, I love him... <+++++> Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!
So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out. <+++++> Because , it's weird!
Why? <+++++> What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's like if a woman wanted to be...
Yes? <+++++> King?
Oooh... I really can't hear what she says come here. <+++++> You gotta be at least bi...
Oh... Oh boy...  Hi... <+++++> Is everything allright?
You know, I can't tell it again... <+++++> And I'm fine never having heard it...  Rach, can I... can I see you for a sec?
Yeah!  Excuse me... <+++++> Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.
Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, that's all. <+++++> Okay, okay, see... that... that is the problem. He is too sensitive.
What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby? <+++++> Yeah, I mean, all things that guy...  These are amazing!
Sandy made Madeleines. <+++++> This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks.
Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle. <+++++> Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
Yeah! I think that's great! <+++++> Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes Madeleines?
Oh... How are they? <+++++> Lighter than air...  But that's not the point.
Hey! <+++++> Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
Really...? Guys do that...? That's... weird... <+++++> Thank you!
That's like a woman wanting to be a... <+++++> ...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?
Yeah, so? <+++++> Wow!
So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing is... <+++++> Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?
What are you guys talking about? <+++++> Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...?  That slayed me. <+++++> Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you!
Not knowing when to shut up... <+++++> Yep! That's my thing...
Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught me Hot- cross Buns. <+++++> Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.
Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this... <+++++> I swear to God...!
Well, please welcome... The Snufflebumps... Who wants to be mr. Wigglemunch and who's gonna be the Grumpus? <+++++> Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?
I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch. <+++++> Oh my God!
That was kind of rude! <+++++> Oh, I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps for me.
You know, he was just doing his job... <+++++> Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can't... I can't go through with this.
Oh, come on Ross... <+++++> No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...
Oh... That's true. <+++++> Thank you!
I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo. <+++++> Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I'm afraid it's not working out.
Oh... <+++++> Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... with Emma... uhm... We just feel...
YOU! You feel! <+++++> I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...
Oh, damn you Geller! <+++++> Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings.
No, none at all. You need to be happy with whoever is in your home... Although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem? Maybe it's something I can work on in the future. <+++++> No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's uhm... my issue.
What is it...?  Please...? <+++++> You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you.
That's fair... Although, can I ask... why do you think that is? <+++++> Why... I... I don't know.  Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?
hmmm... <+++++> I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now.
Huh ha ha! <+++++> I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.
That must have been hard. <+++++> It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says...  "What are you doing with those things? What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like a... like a real boy?
But you are a real boy! <+++++> I know I am!  ...And when it's summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?
It's allright! Crying is good. It lets the boo-hoos out. <+++++> Here come some more...
I tried, but apparantly singing  "I will survive" in a helium voice \- not helping. <+++++> Hey you guys!
Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me. <+++++> Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly . Molly, Chandler, Joey.
Hi. <+++++> Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.
Oh, wow, Molly is just great! <+++++> Yeah.
Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross? <+++++> Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ....
What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way. <+++++> Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it.
I'm gonna take her back to the appartment. <+++++> Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you \- wovyou dovyou ...
I think it's sweet. <+++++> Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma.
So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable?  Yeah, sounds about right. <+++++> Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.
Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more! <+++++> What are you, a child?
Yes! <+++++> Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.
Seriously dude, 3 years ago. <+++++> Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
You don't trust him? <+++++> Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the  "hot nanny".
Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now. <+++++> You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me?
Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it. <+++++> Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees.
Picturing that tree? <+++++> I am, yes.
Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help. <+++++> Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.
I'm sorry, I got a little occupied. <+++++> We have to stop them before something happens!
Molly ... people don't study acting ... <+++++> Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?
Sure, I'll go check on Emma. <+++++> Thanx.
Will the stable boy never get the princess?? <+++++> What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?
No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real?  Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again. <+++++> Come on! Joe!
Hi, is Molly here? <+++++> Yeah, come on in. Molly?
Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha .  I'll see you tomorrow. <+++++> Ok ...  Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have no problem.
All right, uh  Oh hey, you 've done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows? <+++++> Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Hey, what have you guys been up to? <+++++> Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
How is  "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate? <+++++> How 's Monica coming along with her vows?
Well let 's just say its she's lucky she has a sweet ass, 'cause she's not so good at the writing. <+++++> I can 't believe in four weeks they're gonna be married!
Well let 's just hope it works. Y'know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce? <+++++> Phoebe that 's not true.
Has it been that long?! <+++++> Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!! <+++++> What's going on?
HI!! Hi! <+++++> What?! What?!
Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment! <+++++> Actually, it looks really good.
I don 't want them to move to a Volvo dealership! <+++++> It 'll be okay Joe.
Hey, who's this little naked guy? <+++++> That little naked guy would be me.
Aww, look at the little thing. <+++++> Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Who are those people? <+++++> Got me.
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25? <+++++> Looks like a fun gang.
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked! <+++++> Nono, that would be me again.
What? I don 't get it. <+++++> Oh man, this is hilarious.
Okay, what do you guys think? <+++++> Dude!
You really like it? <+++++> Dude! How-how did you write this?
I stole Monica 's and changed the name. <+++++> You can 't do that!
I 'm ready! <+++++> You sure?
Thanks daddy. <+++++> No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it 's all yours.
Okay. Okay. <+++++> Yes! Yes! Yes!!
Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and it bent. <+++++> Yeah.
I never had a bike of my own. <+++++> What?!
That sounds like my first bike.  My dad gave me his old one. <+++++> Ohh.
No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front.  So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard. <+++++> That is so unfair!
Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!! <+++++> Mine stole my newspaper! It 's like a crime wave!!  Pheebs, you uh, you got a second.
Sure! <+++++> Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn 't stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a first bike, so
Oh my God Ross!! <+++++> You like it?
I love it!! <+++++> Yeah?
Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you! <+++++> Ahh.
Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer! <+++++> Ah!  Well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, y 'know give it a test ride.
Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I 've ever gotten. <+++++> You 're welcome.
Those two only had each other! <+++++> Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin ' it by the park. <+++++> Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?
Ohh, uh-huh so much! <+++++> Pheebs you uh you do know how to ride a bike don't you?
Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat -or a beanbag chair! <+++++> Phoebe, you can 't get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!
Why? Why do I have to learn? <+++++> Well In-in case of emergency.
What kind of an emergency? <+++++> Well let there -what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, "You ride this bike or I'll sh I'll shoot you."
Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star. <+++++> Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and -Hey! I'll hold you up and-and push you. Okay?
You won 't let go? <+++++> No!
Swear?! <+++++> I swear!
Okay. <+++++> Come on.  All right, here we go. All right?
All right. <+++++> All right. Feel good?
Well <+++++> All right, try pedaling.
Okay. <+++++> That 's it, your doing great.
Okay. <+++++> Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!
Weee!!! <+++++> Yes!! Yes!!!
Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore! <+++++> I-I just thought you were doing so well. I
I am shocked! Shocked!! <+++++> It 's a legitimate learning technique.  Wow!
Well, they 're just gonna have to wait aren't they? I've only got two hands!! <+++++> Need some help?
No! You don 't know the system! There'll be nobody messing with the system! <+++++> By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.
Oh, hello liar. <+++++> Look, I-I 'm really sorry I let go of the bike.
I could 've been killed I hope you know! <+++++> I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe!
Well, I would love to but the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects. <+++++> Phoebe.
What?!  What the hell?! <+++++> All right, y 'know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I'm sorry, I'm just gonna have to take it back.
What?! Why?! <+++++> Because! Because, it-it-it 's It'd be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don 't ride it you-you're-you're killing its spirit!  The bike is dying.
All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay. <+++++> Great! Great!  You 're making the bike very happy.
I can 't believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that! Thank you Ross. <+++++> Oh hey, don 't thank me, thank yourself. You're the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
No-no, that 's not, that's not me Phoebe, that 's her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F.  Best Friends Forever. <+++++> Oh!
I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach? <+++++> Yeah! Yeah, we can!
Shoot! I can 't go, I have to work! <+++++> That 's too bad.
Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house. <+++++> Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?
Ross gave it to me. <+++++> Yeah, I think she looks good.
Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage. <+++++> Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.
I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker. <+++++> No, no!
Okay, who 's next?! <+++++> No-o-o!  No way!
Come on, please?! I 'm boredddd! You let me do it once before. <+++++> Yeah well, if ah, if that 's the rule this weekend...  No!
Yes! <+++++> Get away!
Just once! <+++++> Stay away!
Take it like a man, Ross! <+++++> No!  No!
Big bullies!! <+++++> Ow! Ow! Oh, no-no-no!
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring? <+++++> Noo!!
I don 't know, but we're having dinner tomorrow night, so I figured, she's gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to, buy me presents, I don't know! So, you're all bored? <+++++> Ohh!!
Yeah, well, I couldn 't find any cards, so it was either this or Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff. <+++++> Okay,  Fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect two cool points. Yeah.
Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off one item of clothing. It hasn 't happened yet, but we're all very excited. <+++++> Okay, come on!  Daddy needs a new pair of electromagnetic microscopes for the Prehistoric Forensics Department!   Okay.  Take Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point, collect three cool points!! Yeah! Which gives me five, and let 's see who is gonna lose their clothes. Ummmm, I think I pick our strip poker sponsor Mr. Joey Tribianni.
All right, relax. It 's just a shoe. <+++++> Wooooo!!!!
All right, I 'm gonna make more margaritas! <+++++> Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?
I 'm just making margaritas. <+++++> Okay.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!  Hi Bonnie!
Hi! My boss let me off early, so I took the train. <+++++> Oh.
Oh, yeah, I don 't know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house. <+++++> Good morning.
Like a log. <+++++> Us too.
I 'm going for a walk. <+++++> Good morning. Nice breasts by the way.
Well, she 's out of town so, there's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is. <+++++> Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
Well, are any of those people here?! <+++++> Oh, no!! No, no!
Hey, everybody! <+++++> Wow!!
Wow!! <+++++> Wh-haa-haa! Look what  'cha did!
You wanna touch it? <+++++> Nooo, but it, but it 's great.
Come on, touch it! <+++++> Okay.  You can feel all the bones in your skull.
Hi! <+++++> I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what, she- she happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um, whole head shaving idea, and now, who was it? Oh, that 's right, that's right, it was you!
That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge. <+++++> She said you gave her the razor!
So, anyone up for a midnight dip in the ocean? <+++++> Ahh, no, I 'm good.
Okay, I 'll see you in a bit. <+++++> Okay, have fun! Wooo!!
Come on see, she doesn 't look that bad. <+++++> You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head! What the hell were you thinking?!!
I don 't know. <+++++> You don 't know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!
All right! Ross, do you think it 's easy for me to see you with somebody else? <+++++> Y'know, hey! You 're the one who ended it, remember?
Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you! <+++++> You still love me?
Noo. <+++++> You still love me.
Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me! <+++++> Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
Noo! Maybe! I, I don 't know. Ross, I still can't forgive you for what you did, I can't, I just, but sometimes when I'm with you I just, I feel so... <+++++> What?!
I just, I feel, I-I just... <+++++> What?
I 'm telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together! <+++++> That 's not true! Her, she doesn't even know what she wants! Rachel's still mad about the whole thing.
Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don 't need that kind've hurt. Take it from a guy who's never had a long term relationship...... <+++++> I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!
Okay, well g 'night. <+++++> Good night.
Don 't be too long. <+++++> Okey-dokey!
There is not one hair on that head. <+++++> Hey, it 'll grow back, right? And she-she's really fun, and she's cool, and-and I'm finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel was so , y'know? Y'know, and I'm finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her, and-and-and it doesn't work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that again?
So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you 're doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on. <+++++> Yeah.
Hi <+++++> Hey! Hi!
I have an audition for this play and for some of it I have to speak French. Which, according to my resume, I'm fluent in. <+++++> Joey, you shouldn't lie on your resume.
Yeah, you really shouldn't.  By the way, how was that year-long dig in Cairo? <+++++> It was ok...
Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"?  No? Divorce? <+++++> Hey.
Hey. <+++++> You guys know where Rachel is?
No, we haven't seen her since this morning. <+++++> So unbelievable. She was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with Emma.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
These are for Erica! <+++++> What? She's gonna eat all those cookies?
Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat! <+++++> So, why is Erica coming to visit?
Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it? <+++++> Oh, hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!
Ross... <+++++> No, no, no, I'm sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney's?
My father had an heart attack...  ...while I was at Barney's. <+++++> Oh my God.
I'm so sorry... <+++++> Is-is he ok?
Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's still heavily sedated. <+++++> Ok, ok. I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you, I mean, you can't be alone right now.
No, come on, I'm totally ok.  I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own. <+++++> Still-still, let me come... for me.
Ok. If you really need to. <+++++> I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly baked cookies.
Oh, I really could. <+++++> Oh!
Oh, uhm, excuse me, I'm here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green. <+++++> And I'm Doctor Ross Geller.
Absolutely. <+++++> Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I don't want to infect him.
Ross, please, don't be so scared of him! <+++++> I'm not scared of him, I'm really sick!
He's under sedation, so he's pretty much out. <+++++> I'm feeling better.
Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok? <+++++> He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine!
Ok. <+++++> Did the TV wake you?
No, when you put your feet up in my bed, you tugged on my catheter. <+++++> Ouchy.
What are you doing here, Geller? <+++++> Well, I came with Rachel, who should be back any second!  So what's new?
Ooh, I have a little heart attack. <+++++> Right, is it painful?
So what's new with you, uh, knocked up any more of my daughters lately? <+++++> Nope, just the one. RACH!
Hi! <+++++> I was gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream.  I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.
Uh.  Did you call your parents? <+++++> Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.
Oh good. <+++++> Wow.
What? <+++++> Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.
What do you mean? You've been in my room before! <+++++> Yeah, sure, right! Like I've ever been in Rachel Green's room.
Ok I gotta tell ya, it's really weird when you use my whole name. <+++++> Sorry. . You ok?
Yeah. <+++++> You had a rough day, uh?
Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean he is a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick! <+++++> But we do!  It's gonna be ok, Rach!
Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital! <+++++> What? No, no! Hey, hey, hey look...
What? <+++++> They gave him a lot of medication, ok? He wouldn't even know if you were there. Look, we'll go see him first thing in the morning, ok?
Really, I shouldn't feel guilty? <+++++> No, God! Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.
Ok, maybe you're right. <+++++> Good night.
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while? <+++++> Sure!
Ok.  Thank you for coming with me today. <+++++> Oh, of course...
Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room! <+++++> Me too. Come here.
I just don't want to be alone tonight. <+++++> Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or... Oh, oh. . No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea.
Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we? <+++++> No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.
Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy! <+++++> Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!
Wow. Ok. <+++++> I'll see you in the morning .
Mhm-mh! <+++++> Haven't had sex in four months, I should get a medal for that!
Sure. <+++++> You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?
Hmm-hmm. <+++++> You sure you're alright?
Yep. <+++++> O-kay. Well, I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast.
FYI.. <+++++> There it is...
In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it. <+++++> Wait, wait,  You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.
Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied! <+++++> Well...
Oh stop that! <+++++> I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.
Oh, that is so hot. She walks around him to the other side) <+++++> Hey, I was looking out for you.
Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me. <+++++> I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.
Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either. <+++++> Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again.
What? <+++++> That's right, sex is off the table.  I am never having sex with you again.  Dr. Green, are you feeling better?
Oh, good. <+++++> So uh... I guess I wanna take off.
Okay... Hey listen, just before you go I-I again, I just wanna say "thank you" for coming with me. <+++++> Oh, no problem.
And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again. <+++++> Thank you. I'm glad you agree.
It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good. <+++++> Yeah... Yeah, that's true.
Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...? <+++++> Oh, ye-ah!
You know it was you're uhm... birthday... <+++++> ...Valentine's day...
Well, I guess that's all in the past, now. <+++++> Hmmm-mmmm.
Not even one more time? <+++++> Not even once.
No matter how much we want it. <+++++> Even if we want it really bad.
That's what we decided. <+++++> Uhm, right!
...It's kinda hard though! <+++++> Yeah.
You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste. <+++++> ...I hate waste.
...Ross? <+++++> Yes?
Just so you know... With us... it's never off the table. <+++++> Damn it. It's never off the table.
Hello, people who do not live here. <+++++> Hi! Hello!
We were out of Doritos. <+++++> Hey, how 'd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?
He 's great! I mean we have such a good time together! He's so funny, and sooo sweet, and I'm not attracted to him at all!! <+++++> Still?!
Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! <+++++> I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can 't do it, they're all like-like laughing at me. <+++++> Hello.
Hey! <+++++> So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
Wow, what-what do you think she wants? <+++++> Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.
It 's possible. You are very loveable, I'd miss you if I broke up with you.  I was just trying to be supportive. <+++++> Then be supportive like a guy.
Hi! <+++++> You ah, wanted to see me?
Yeah. Ahh, here 's a box of your stuff. <+++++> What?!
Oh, y'know, it 's just like hats, and a shirt, and CD's, just sort of stuff that you've left here. <+++++> What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?
No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it 's time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don't' you think? <+++++> Yes.
Yeah? <+++++> Yes, I do.
Good. <+++++> Yeah, I-I really do.  Hey! This-this was a gift?!
Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop. <+++++> It 's still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!
Okay, all right, give me the mug! I 'll keep the mug. <+++++> No!! Y'know-y'know don 't do me any favours. In fact, where, where's the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm,  Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I'd like that back too. Yes, I do.
You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt! <+++++> I 'm just trying to help you, move on.
Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty.... <+++++> Petty...
Petty... <+++++> Petty...
Petty... <+++++> Petty...
Small... <+++++> Small...
You are so just doing this out of spite. <+++++> Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!
Huh? <+++++> I 'm-I'm gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!!
You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn 't even fit you anymore! <+++++> Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...
yeah-yeah-yeah!! <+++++> Oh-oh, okay, okay!  If you don't mind I'm gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt.  You have a pleasant evening.
I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn 't matter, I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It's so annoying. Does it bug you? <+++++> You bug me.
Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can 't just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You're gonna get peep eye! <+++++> I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she 'd say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!
You didn 't just break up. <+++++> Hey, it 's been like three weeks!
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower! <+++++> Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I 'm gonna kill myself, I swear. I can't, I can't watch this.  Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she's going in.
Okay. <+++++> She 's going in. Wait! He's going in! He's going in!! The door's closed! I, I can't see anything but the door closed!!
And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave. <+++++> Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!
Stop what?! <+++++> I don 't know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I'll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!
No!! You can 't!! <+++++> Look, they must be stopped!
I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!!  You are surprisingly strong! <+++++> I need juice! People need juice!!
Look man! <+++++> People need juice!
Listen to me!! <+++++> Juice, I need...
She 's moving on! Okay, if it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else! And unless you're thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It 's over. <+++++> Yeah, okay.
Okay. <+++++> It 's just I miss her so much.
Hey! <+++++> Hey, what are you doing?
That's funny, we were doing the same thing! <+++++> Yeah!
It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost- cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell. <+++++> There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.
I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry. <+++++> Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.
I think it would make me wanna marry you even more. <+++++> I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!
Maybe you do that next time you get married! <+++++> No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset.
Hi! Emma will be up in a minute! <+++++> Oh, good!
Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry. <+++++> Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.
Absolutely. <+++++> There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge!
So, uhm... what are you gonna do today? <+++++> Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!
Oh my God, what!? <+++++> Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!
Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground. <+++++> Be-caaauuuse...
All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing incident... when I was little. <+++++> Seriously?
Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair!  And it was uneven for weeks! <+++++> And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie!
Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes. <+++++> Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and you'll see!
Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth! <+++++> Space is filled with orbiting children.  Look, please, just come on, you know, when you 'll see the look on Emma's face, I swear you won't regret it.
All right! <+++++> Good, you don 't want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you?
Irrational, huh? All right, well, I 'll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment! <+++++> Oh, yeah, that 's the same, I am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings!
Ok, careful. <+++++> Ok.
Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR! <+++++> Rach, she 's got like three hairs!
I know  but they're just so beautiful! Oh, my God, I just pulled one out. <+++++> I promise you she 's safe! No watch how much she loves this.
Ok. <+++++> Ready sweety?
Ok. <+++++> Here we go!
Ok, careful, ok.  Oh, she 's smiling! Oh my God, she does like it! <+++++> See, I told you!
Awe!  Oh my God! Looks, she 's a little dare-devil! Oh, let me push, can I push? <+++++> Oh, absolutely!
Ok. Oh God.  Get the camera, it 's in the diaper bag. <+++++> Ok!  See? Scared of swings, I bet you feel pretty silly  Ow!
Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay? <+++++> SON OF A BITCH!  (To the
Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it. That is <+++++> No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault and kind
Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets <+++++> No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing, okay? And
I know what this is all about... You've always been <+++++> Look, I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your silly
Alright fine. I'll do it. <+++++> Good.
If you hold a spider. <+++++> WHAT? WHERE? WHERE?
IF you hold a spider. <+++++> I know. (Rachel bends down to Emma and Ross looks over his shoulder again,
Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one. <+++++> Ok...
Ok... <+++++> This feels perfectly normal. Ok, get on the swing!
whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH! <+++++> See?
A-alright! I can do this. <+++++> There you go! Good for you! And you know what, I'm actually getting used to this little guy. I don't really even feel him in here anymore.
That's because he's on your neck. <+++++> Well...  Whaa... aaah... aaahhh...
Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy 's theory. Okay? <+++++> Hey!
Hey. <+++++> I 'm gonna be on TV!!
No way! <+++++> Yeah! They 're putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel 's gonna film it!
Oh my God! Who 's gonna watch that?! <+++++> Thanks. You ready to go?
Oh God! <+++++> Hey, you guys! Guess what?
Got a job on a river boat? <+++++> Y'know what I didn 't wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You're not my girlfriend anymore so...
Oh I see, so this suit is making a point. <+++++> Right.
Now that you 're on you're own, you're free to look as stupid as you like. <+++++> You like it right?
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?! <+++++> Okay, good bye!
Do you think we 'll get our three bucks back? <+++++> Hey!
Hey! <+++++> Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think?  This blue suit, or this brown one?
Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one. <+++++> Really?
Oww! <+++++> Wow! That aspirin dance really works!
Oww! <+++++> Oh my God, is that still...
I 'm fine, I'm fine. <+++++> No you 're not.
Yes I am! <+++++> Rach!
Look, I 'm fine. Watch.  Look at that.  Whoa-whoa! <+++++> Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a doctor! Okay?
No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It 's a very big deal, there's a lot of people there I have to meet. <+++++> And I 'm sure you're gonna make a big impression. Hi! I'm Rachel Green. It's nice to meet you.  Come on, you probably have a broken rib!
Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it 'll still be broken then. <+++++> Rach...
But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready. <+++++> Rachel...
Look, either help me or go. <+++++> Fine. I 'll go.
Okay, but before you go, could you help me first? <+++++> Sure. I 'll help you.
Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too? <+++++> Ohh.
Okay. Let 's use this brush. <+++++> Okay. This stuff?
Yeah. <+++++> All right.
Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it. <+++++> Oke-dokey.
Oh-ho! <+++++> Sorry.
Hey! That 's just poking me in the eye! <+++++> Sorry, I 'm sorry. Close, close, close...
Okay, just sweep it. <+++++> I 'm sweeping...
Right. <+++++> Sweep, sweep....
Okay, now make it even,  'cause we don't... <+++++> What? What?
We don 't want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle. <+++++> No. No, y'know you don 't, you don't wear enough of this.  What?
Since when, since when do you think I don 't wear enough of this? <+++++> Well I, close your eyes, I just think you 're gonna like this a little better, 'cause, close-close...
Blow it. <+++++> Sorry.  'Cause umm, I think this will make you a little more sophisticated.
Sure. <+++++> Yep?
Sure, I 'll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing. <+++++> Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?
Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed? <+++++> Sure, okay.
Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around. <+++++> What?
I don 't want you to see me naked! <+++++> Rachel, I 've seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?
Yeah, but that was different. Y 'know? I mean, we were, we were going out then, now I think it's weird. <+++++> Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.
What? <+++++> All I have to do is close my eyes. See?  Woo-hoo!!
Ross! Stop that! <+++++> Ah, I 'm sorry.
Come on! I don 't want you thinking of me like that any more! <+++++> Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It 's one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend.  Oop, oh yeah!
Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out! <+++++> Okay, okay, I 'm sorry, it will never happen...  Uh-oh! Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I'm the king.
Rosss... <+++++> Come on, would you grow up? It 's no big deal.
All right.  Fine. <+++++> Yowzah!!!
O-kay!! See what you did, I 'm gonna be doing it by myself now. Okay? <+++++> Aww, come on.
That 's it.  Ow!!! <+++++> Oh my God!
Oh-ow! <+++++> All right.
Ow! <+++++> Look...
Ow! <+++++> Okay.

Ow! Ow! <+++++> Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?
Okay, I do. <+++++> Okay.
I really do. <+++++> Okay, I 'm gonna get your coat and then I'll-I'll put you in a cab.
Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you 're not gonna come with me? <+++++> Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
Okay. <+++++> Okay?
Thank you.  Oww!!!! God! <+++++> What?! I wh-, what 's wrong?
Okay, you 'd tell me the truth. Right? <+++++> Rach, you can 't look fat in an x-ray.
Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!! <+++++> That 's a duck.
That 's a bad duck!!!  How'd the thing go tonight, Ross? <+++++> Oh, it was, nah, well....
What thing? What thing? <+++++> Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on.  Easy.
What thing? What is this thing? <+++++> I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel.
Oh my God! <+++++> Yeah.
Ross, why didn 't you tell me that? <+++++> Eh,  'cause I knew that if I told you, you'd make me go, and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on.
I cannot believe you. <+++++> What?
That is the sweetest thing, I just.... <+++++> You should get some sleep.
Okay. <+++++> So, I 'll umm...
Oh, I 'm sorry I spoiled you're evening. <+++++> No, that 's, no, as long as you're okay. So I'll ah, I'll see you tomorrow.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Hey sweetie! <+++++> WOW!
Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs! <+++++> I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?
She went on one of those spray-on tan places. <+++++> Eh, you got a spray-on tan?
Chandler gets pedicures! <+++++> Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?
Why...why? <+++++> Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean, it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!
Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off. <+++++> So, do you get colours or just French tips?
There. Here's their card. <+++++> Thanks.  Hey, I know where this place is! It used to be an X-rated video...  florist.
Alright Mr. Geller! Right this way! So, how dark do you wanna be? We have one, two or three. <+++++> Well... I like how you look, what are you?
Puerto Rican. <+++++> Two, I think a two.
You've got to face the red light. When the red light goes on the spraying is about to start so close your eyes. When the spraying stops, count to five. Pat yourself down to avoid drip marks then turn around so we can get your back. Got it? <+++++> Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.
Wow, you catch on quick. <+++++> Well, I have a PhD, so...
Well, I have a PhD, so... <+++++> One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis... WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've not finished counting!!
One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis... WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've not finished counting!! <+++++> You sprayed my front twice!
You've never turned? <+++++> No, I barely even got to three Mississippi.
Mississippi? I said count to five'! <+++++> Mississippilesly?  Well, how bad is it?
Ain't that bad yet, but it keeps getting darker for the next four hours. <+++++> So, how dark is it gonna get?
You got sprayed with two two' s and... <+++++> I'm a four?
Yeah, but you're back's a zero. You're gonna wanna even that out. <+++++> Really!
You might wanna get back in there. <+++++> Ok!
Ok! <+++++> Wait, wait a minute, there's no light on the back wall! How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello?  Ah, oh, ah!  Ah!  The same thing happened again!
You got two more twos? <+++++> I'm an eight!
Hold on! There is something different. <+++++> I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
Was that place... The Sun? <+++++> Oh! And it gets worse!
How could you mess this up? It's so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!! <+++++> How do you count to five?
One Two Three... <+++++> Damnit!
oooh! Oh oh! <+++++> I Know!
Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the booth, and... <+++++> I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them all on my back.
Okay... <+++++> Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?
Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it? <+++++> Which... which... which... Which one is it?
Which... which... which... Which one is it? <+++++> OH! SON OF A BITCH!
Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in. <+++++> Go away! I don't want to see anybody.
I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in. <+++++> Really? Did you count Mississipily?
Really? Did you count Mississipily? <+++++> Dude, you're not tanned.
Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. . <+++++> Halftime.
Let 's do it! Ross? <+++++> What?
Do you wanna play football? <+++++> Um, Monica and I aren 't supposed to play football.
Says who? Your mom? <+++++> Yeah.
Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind 've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose. <+++++> It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
To score the winning touchdown, by the way. <+++++> Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn 't count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.
I won the game. <+++++> Oh yeah! Then how come you didn 't get the Geller Cup?
Um, there was a Geller Cup? <+++++> Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said,  'nobody won that game, ' and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and....  threw it in the lake.
And was the curse lifted? <+++++> Anyway. That 's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.
Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it 's been twelve years. <+++++> Can I see you for a second?
Once!! <+++++> All right, we 're gonna play.
Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me. <+++++> Here you go.
What? <+++++> Bunny!
Monica, I 'm your best friend. <+++++> Sweetie, don 't worry you'll get picked. Chandler.
Phoebe. <+++++> Sweetie, now I pick you.
You don 't pick me! You 're stuck with me! <+++++> Okay. All right. So let 's see, let's play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we'll kick off.
The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice. <+++++> Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!
Are you okay? <+++++> Come on, let 's go!
Losers walk! <+++++> Yeah, losers talk!
Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!!  You wanna go shotgun? <+++++> Yeah!
Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7. <+++++> Okay,  this play, I want you to do a down and out to the right. Okay. Break!
Wait, what am I gonna do? <+++++> You, you go long.
Wait, how long? <+++++> Until we start to look very small.
Okay. <+++++> Break!!
Set....hike! <+++++> One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!
Come on guys! Let 's go! Come on, it's second down. <+++++> Uh, hello, it 's third down.
No it 's not, it's second. <+++++> Wow!
Wow, what? <+++++> It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.
Pulling what? It 's second down. <+++++> Okay, it 's second down.  Take all the second downs you need.
I heard that! <+++++> Well, I said it loud.
Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it 's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle. <+++++> Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?
Can I see that for second. <+++++> Yeah.
Yeah. <+++++> Okay. Hut! Hike!
Touchdown!! Touchdown!! <+++++> Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn 't count.
After the snap! <+++++> Before the snap!
Now, does it really matter? <+++++> Yes!!
Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So? <+++++> Oh Pheebs, that 's great. It doesn't count.
Does so count! <+++++> Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.
Y'know what, that 's fine, maybe you haven't grown up, but I have. <+++++> Oh-ho, okay.
Dead leg!! <+++++> Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.
No! Listen, I 'm not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can't blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let's just call this, tie score and it's halftime. <+++++> Okay, first of all, I don 't play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!
Y'know what? I 'll think you'll play. <+++++> Oh really! Why is that?
Because the winner gets this! <+++++> The Geller Cup.
Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four? <+++++> Yeah.
When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out. <+++++> That cup is mine!
Here you go! <+++++> Chandler! Chandler!
Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don 't see that everyday, do ya? <+++++> Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What 's with the tackling?
What?! I just touched him and he went over. <+++++> Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough.
Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done! <+++++> It 's no surprise that your winning, 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.
Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I 'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game. <+++++> What?! The guys against the girls? See, that 's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns.
Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls. <+++++> Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you 're with me.
Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it 's better if we're on the same team. <+++++> Right. Okay, let 's play. Let's go.
Oh, my. <+++++> Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let 's play some ball, guys.
Fine with me. <+++++> Okay, y'know what, let 's just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?
Which do I like? <+++++> Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...
Y'know what, it doesn 't matter, 'cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook! <+++++> Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
We 're not gonna lose to girls. <+++++> Hey! It 's 42-21!
Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn 't the play still going. <+++++> Let go! Let go!
Let go! <+++++> No! You let go!
No! <+++++> How come it 's always us left in the field holding the ball?
I don 't know. I guess the other people just don't care enough. <+++++> Hey! It 's starting to snow.
Hey! It 's starting to snow. <+++++> Gimme the this!
I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet? <+++++> I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.
Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's. <+++++> God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.
Did I miss it, did I miss it? <+++++> She's not even here yet.
I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical. <+++++> Where the hell have you been?
I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky. <+++++> Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunky s.
I got an extra one. You want this? <+++++> No.
Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing? <+++++> Dr. Franzblau, hi.
They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds. <+++++> 59 seconds.  Quartz, ha.
Ice chips, just ice chips. They're at the nurses' station. <+++++> I'll get it.
No, I'm getting it. I'll be right back. <+++++> I got it -I'm getting it!
Thanks, Ross. <+++++> Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
Breathe. <+++++> Breathe.
Breathe. <+++++> Breathe.
You're gonna kill me! <+++++> 15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12...
It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keep focusing on Jordie. <+++++> Who the hell is Jordie?
Your son. <+++++> No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.
Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie. <+++++> What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp. <+++++> I got it.
I got it. <+++++> I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.
All right, that's it. I want both of you out. <+++++> Why?
He started it! <+++++> No, you started it.
I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier. <+++++> But...
Now go! <+++++> Thanks a lot.
See what you did. <+++++> Yeah, listen...
How, how is this my fault? <+++++> Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.
Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along. <+++++> You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me. <+++++> Oh, I'm threatened by you?
Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it! <+++++> Yeah, Susan.
Help! <+++++> I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back.  Ow.
What're you gonna do, suck the door open? <+++++> Help! Help!
They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next... la la la la la la. <+++++> Help!
The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have. <+++++> No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?
You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day. <+++++> Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
This is so great. <+++++> You wanna explain that?
Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue! <+++++> Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben.
Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent. <+++++> Phoebs, It's open! It's open!
Push, push! <+++++> We're here!
Where have you been? <+++++> Long story, honey.
All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go! <+++++> Good luck!
All right, he's crowning. Here he comes. <+++++> Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?
You're doing great, you're doing fine. <+++++> Hello!  Oh, sorry.
What do you see? What do you see? <+++++> We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.
What does he look like? <+++++> Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell-o.
You guys, he's beautiful! <+++++> Oh, thanks, Pheebs!
No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy. <+++++> How 'bout Ben?
Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before? <+++++> We uh, we just cooked it up.
Hi. <+++++> Hey.
Can we come in? <+++++> I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody.
Ross, can I? <+++++> The head, the head. You gotta...
He doesn't do much, does he? <+++++> No, this is pretty much it.
You guys wanna get some coffee? <+++++> Yeah.
Yeah. <+++++> All right, I'll see you guys later.
Yeah. But a part of me also can 't wait 'til it's over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding. <+++++> A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
I gotta make up the guest bedroom.  Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days. <+++++> Cassie?
Uh-hmm. <+++++> Wow, I haven 't seen her for like forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes.
Ross, she 's 25 years old. <+++++> So what! I still have -No you're probably right.
Cassie needs to stay at your place. <+++++> What -why?
Because Purvry Perverson over here can 't stop staring at her. <+++++> What?! Chandler she 's our cousin!
You were staring about eight inches south of there. <+++++> Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
Hey Ross! <+++++> Hey!
It 's been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi. <+++++> Oh. Oh, that 's right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn't.
Ah yeah, sorry about that. <+++++> It 's okay. Come, come on in.
Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica 's place was nice, but her fiancee sure stares a lot. <+++++> Oh.
Oh my God! You do a great Chandler! <+++++> Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions.
Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me. <+++++> Yeah -No!!
I 'm all done. <+++++> Thank God.
I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together. <+++++> Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you  'til you cried?  We're probably too old to do that now.
I 'll always remember that summer, because it's when I got all of these freckles. <+++++> Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I 'll always remember that summer because that's when I realized that we are related.
It took you that long to figure it out, huh? <+++++> Well I 'm, I'm a little slow.  Just as our children would be.
Hey! What the hell are you doing?! <+++++> Say something clever!  Okay, doesn 't have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words.  Any words will do.  Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever!   There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!!   I-I, I uh haven't had sex in a very long time.   Yeah, you really shouldn 't have said anything.
Phoebe and I are moving in together. <+++++> Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!
Yes dear. <+++++> I can't believe you guys are moving in together. That's, that's great! I mean...I'm happy for you guys..
Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah. Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do. <+++++> Phoebe, I had no idea you were so conventional.
Hi <+++++> Hey!
Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage. <+++++> Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for all hanging out but to come to my home!
No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it. <+++++> Why?
Mike doesn't ever wanna get married. <+++++> Never?
Never. <+++++> wow, are you still going to move in with him?
I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks! <+++++> Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.
That's not how you really feel is it? <+++++> No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but I can't help it. I love marriage.
Seriously? You divorce-o? <+++++> If you have to call me name, I prefer  "Ross the Divorcer". It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry.
It's ok that's how you feel. <+++++> But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have so much fun and you love Mike.
I do love Mike. <+++++> Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before, and you know what? You should be. It's a big deal!
Yeah I guess you're right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks. <+++++> The Divorcer, to the rescue!
It's not cooler. <+++++> Yeah I just hurt it.
Very cool. <+++++> Hey Pheebs, you know I'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the other day and I hope I was a little helpful.
Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you. <+++++> Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.
What do you mean? <+++++> Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?
They are awfully boxy... <+++++> I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so... normal.
Uh huh. <+++++> Hey hey, can I help?
Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky. <+++++> You know sometimes your words... they hurt.
Okay you have to realize, I was exhausted, I was emotional, I would have said yes to anybody. Like that time you and I got married!  I 'm not helping. <+++++> So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?
That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but I am prepared to let that go. <+++++> So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend.
Well -Really? I thought Chandler was your best friend. <+++++> Well, Chandler 's my oldest friend, but Joey's my-No! Ah!
Hey you guys I 'm gonna take off. I just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye. <+++++> Rachel said she 'd marry you?!
Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket. <+++++> Okay I put most of the stuff away.
Oh great, the pacifiers? <+++++> In the closet.
The burping clogs? <+++++> Linen closet.
The diapers? <+++++> In the hospital.
Wow you guys got a hospital? <+++++> No I left the diapers at the hospital! There 's some in the bag but I'll run out and get some more.
Alright thanks, oh Ross could you stop by the coffee house and get me a muffin? <+++++> Sure what kind?
Umm let me think...What do I want, what d-o I w-a-n-t... <+++++> Please take your time, it 's an important decision. Not like, say, I know! deciding to marry someone, this is about a muffin.
Blueberry. <+++++> Blueberry it is.
Diapers huh? <+++++> Yep.
So I guess Rachel had you baby? <+++++> Yep, can you believe it?
Nope! <+++++> Huh? Ooh  you mean like a Huh?
Hey.  Ross, I know you're pissed at me, but we have to talk about this. <+++++> Ah actually we don 't.
 <+++++> What!  You didn 't do anything wrong?!
I said I didn 't technically. <+++++> Okay let 's put aside that you  "accidentally" picked up my grandmothers ring and you  "accidentally" proposed to Rachel.
Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this  I don 't really know what that means.  You were saying? <+++++> And I can even understand that you couldn 't tell Rachel, but why couldn't you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didn't.
I know I should 've.  "I'm sorry." <+++++> Not using it right, Joe.
Not using it right, Joe. <+++++> I 'm gonna go.
No, come on Ross!  Look, Ross, we have to get past this. <+++++> Give me the bag.
No, look, I don 't know what else to do. I said I'm sorry! <+++++> Joey!
You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me. <+++++> I 'm not gonna hit you.
Why not? <+++++> No I don 't.
A little bit. <+++++> No.
Little bit. <+++++> No!
A little bit more. <+++++> Give me the bag.
No, hit me <+++++> Give me the bag.
Hit me. <+++++> Joey, give me the bag.
Hit me! <+++++> Joe I 'm not kidding
Hit me, hit me. <+++++> No!
Hit me! Hit me! <+++++> You ducked!!
I 'm sorry! It was a reflex! <+++++> Oh my god, this really hurts!!!
I couldn 't help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look! (He goes to punch Ross, expecting him to duck, but he doesn't and Joey punches Ross. <+++++> What is the matter with you?!?
You were supposed to duck!!! Why didn 't you duck? <+++++> Why don 't we talk about this on the way to the hospital?
Hey, so how is it? <+++++> I broke my thumb.
Your thumb? That 's weird.  You sure you're punching right? Make a fist.  Maybe later. Ross I feel terrible. <+++++> You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms.
You, you want me to help you with that? <+++++> Why, does it look like I 'm having trouble with my misshapen claw?
Name?  I know Ross but what 's it short for? You know like, like Rossel or Rosstepher. <+++++> Just Ross!
It 's pretty, Okay date of birth? <+++++> You know my birthday.
Sure, May...tember. <+++++> October 18th.
Occupation? Dinosaurs. <+++++> Actually I 'm a palian Dinosaurs is fine the drawing is not.
Alright, who do you want as your emergency contact? <+++++> Ah, Rachel I guess.
Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while. <+++++> Just ah just put roommate.
Come on, you guys are more then that! I mean, you 're gonna get together right? <+++++> I don 't think that we are.
But you two were supposed to be together. <+++++> Well, I thought so too, but then she said she 'd marry you.
Come on, Ross, that didn 't mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody. <+++++> Yeah that 's what she said.
So? <+++++> So I don 't wanna be just anybody.
Wow. <+++++> You know what, it 's, it's better this way anyway. I mean I don't know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. It's just much easier if we're just friends who have a kid.
Really? <+++++> Yeah.
And you 're Okay with that? <+++++> Yes. I mean, it 's what we always planned.  And if you have a plan, you should stick to it.  That's why they call them plans.  Hello?  I'm fine.
Hey, for what it 's worth, with Rachel I don't think you'll ever be just  "anybody." <+++++> Hey there you go!
Heeeeey, where have you been?  What happened to you? <+++++> Ah I had a little thing with Joey, if you think this is bad you should see him.
Oh no Ross! This is not good, we have to talk about this Joey thing. Please sit.  You have got to get over this Joey thing, okay? I never really wanted to marry Joey, okay? <+++++> Okay.
You know what I really really want? <+++++> What, Rach?
I wanna sleep, I wanna eat, I wanna take a shower, I mean before she wakes up and we gotta do this all over again. <+++++> Right.
I mean I got news for you mister, Emma? <+++++> Well, that 's what I'm here for.  Want me to get that?
Hi! <+++++> Hey! So what's the big news you had us rush all the way over here for?
Okay, our news. My company has asked me to head up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated. <+++++> Oh my God!
What?! <+++++> Monday?!
We were gonna go see the Jets! <+++++> You can't go, I mean you're the glue that holds this group together!
Really? <+++++> Not you.
Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure I can have caffeine. <+++++> I went thru this with Ben and Carol. One cup of coffee won't affect your milk.
Uhuh. <+++++> Rach, you don't have to call whenever you have a little question, okay? Trust me, I know this.
All right, I trust you. <+++++> Rachel, I can see you dialing! I don't understand why...
Excuse me? Oh yeah? Well, up yours too! <+++++> Who the hell was that?!
Dr. Wiener. <+++++> Rach, you can't call people at three in the morning.
Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife! <+++++> Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?
Yes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane! <+++++> Well, what was it?
Hiccups. <+++++> Rach, I told you, you can't call him every time any little thing comes up.
Yeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name? <+++++> Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a good idea. In fact, I think he's dead.
Argh! Why does everything happen to me?! <+++++> Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well.
What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well? What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot. <+++++> You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like!
Wiener, Wiener  Wiener, Wiener!!! <+++++> Rachel!!!
I think you just have a cold, it's definitely not Strep. <+++++> Thanks doctor.
Would you like a lollypop? <+++++> You even have to ask?!    He is alive!
That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me! <+++++> Hey!
Oh, I really liked him.  Yeah, it was really, really, really good. <+++++> You promised you wouldn't say anything.
Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman? <+++++> He's a brilliant diagnostician!
Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor. <+++++> Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'
Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy? <+++++> Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!
That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging! <+++++> It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!
Mommy, I can't find Waldo. <+++++> With the circus? He's behind the elephant.
Wow, so your child is a big fan of the Waldo books too? <+++++> Yeah, that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way.
Hi, I'm Sally. So, no ring. Can I assume you are also a single parent? <+++++> I am a single parent.
It's hard isn't it? There's almost no time for a social life. I mean, where are you gonna meet someone? <+++++> Well, let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the pediatrician's office.
Rossy, we're ready for you. <+++++> Hmm, yeah.  Come on Ross jr. It's time to go in.
Mommy, what's wrong with that man? <+++++> Hey, I helped you find Waldo!
Where have you been? <+++++> I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office. There was some guy that freaked everybody out.
Well, you got here just in time. I really have to go buddy. <+++++> Oh man.
Hey! Ready to go? <+++++> Oh yeah, let me just finish this.
What are you doin'? <+++++> Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.
Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless . <+++++> It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?
The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you? <+++++> Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident...
Bet she'd sleep with you now... <+++++> No... I already e-mailed her.
Let me see what you wrote about yourself <+++++> You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat.
Hey! <+++++> What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes??
No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him! <+++++> Alright, let's go!
Dude! <+++++> I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!
Damn it! Rookie mistake! <+++++> I have sex with dinosaurs??
I believe I read that somewhere! <+++++> That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...  It's not funny!!
I respectfully disagree. <+++++> I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
Who cares? Nobody reads those things <+++++> You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
I don't have a page. <+++++> Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
And so young. <+++++> Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.
Well, how you died was funny. <+++++> Oh please, hit by a blimp?
It kills over one americans every year. <+++++> Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.
You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West! <+++++> You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.
Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me? <+++++> uhu uhu, check this out.
Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya? <+++++> Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead.  Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?
No, come on, you know that's not true. <+++++> What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!
Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community. <+++++> I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy!
Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief. <+++++> You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.
Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come. <+++++> Exactly!!
Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself!? <+++++> No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!
Ross, don't press send, don't press se... ! <+++++> oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...
There you go! Someone came! <+++++> Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!
At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps <+++++> Who is he?
Some guy, Tom Gordon. <+++++> I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives.
Ok! <+++++> I'm dead and no one cares?
Please, one ridiculous problem at a time! <+++++> It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!
You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand! <+++++> Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?
Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something? <+++++> Yeah...
I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance. <+++++> But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!
You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on you! <+++++> Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
What kinda noise? <+++++> Just a high pitched intimidating noise.
But like how? <+++++> Well we-we don 't know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this.  Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that's uh, that's all for today.  Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?
Yes sir. <+++++> Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I 'm afraid I-I had to fail you.
Why?! <+++++> Well you need 60% to pass
What 'd I get? <+++++> Seven.
That 's not so good. <+++++> No-no it 's not. What-what happened there Ned?
Well maybe you can cut me some slack. I 'm sort of in love. <+++++> Well I 'm sorry but, that-that's really not my problem.
I 'm in love with you. <+++++> Well that brings me in the loop a little.
You see, that 's why I did so bad on this test. I'm having a hard time concentrating. When you're up there  and you're teaching and your face gets all serious you look so good.  You wear that tight little turtleneck sweater <+++++> Okay!  Umm, I uh, I 'm your teacher. I'm sorry, you're-you're a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs.
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie? <+++++> There 's this kid in my class who said he's in love with me.
Ross has a boyfriend. <+++++> I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There 's a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.
Really? <+++++> Yeah! I don 't know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of sexy professor vibe?
Not right now. <+++++> It-it -The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y 'know you-I couldn't concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what's it's like to be 19 and in love. <+++++> Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.
Professor Geller? <+++++> Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?
I know I didn 't do well on my midterms and stuff but, I was kinda hoping you could change my grade. <+++++> And why exactly would I do that?
Because I 'm in love with you. <+++++> What?!
Yeah, I 'm all in love with you and stuff. So could you change my grade? <+++++> No!
Well why not you changed Ned 's grade! <+++++> Well that 's different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me!
No he 's not! He's totally yanking your chain! He's done this with three other teachers! <+++++> What?
He 's got a girlfriend! <+++++> I can 't believe someone would do that for a grade.
That was a great lecture today. Did you get a little hair cut? <+++++> Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to know that I 'm changing your grade back.
What?! Why? <+++++> 'Cause I know what you're trying to pull here. Okay? It's not gonna work.
I 'm not trying to pull anything. Look I love you dude. <+++++> Y 'know what? I-I'm not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay --Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me feel Ned?! You used me! You don't love me and you never did!  Ah Professor Winston, Professor Fredrickson, I'll be right with you.  Don't make this worse and I'll give you a C.  Shall we?
Exellent dream score. <+++++> Why, why, why would you dream that?
Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table. <+++++> I love it, when we share.
You're okay there? <+++++> I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
I don't know. What are you wearing? <+++++> Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?
What are you playing with? <+++++> Oh, it's my new beeper.
Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.' <+++++> No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
Okay, he's a senior in college. <+++++> College?
No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22. <+++++> What?
Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean... <+++++> Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.
All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool. <+++++> Yeah, hi, I was just beeped.  No, AndrÃÂ© is not here.  Third time today.  Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services.
Services?  Oh, services. <+++++> Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right, JUMBO with a U, sir.  No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment.  All rightie, bye bye.
I don't sound like that. <+++++> Oh, oh Chandler...
Oh... Yeah, you do. <+++++> 'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
My scones. <+++++> ' My scones.'
All right. <+++++> Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.
No. <+++++> You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?
No, it was just the three of us. <+++++> Huh!
That is so sweet, you guys. <+++++> Hey, Mon.
Mon, Ethan called again. Mon? <+++++> Mon!
Oh. <+++++> Are you not seeing him anymore?
Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is? <+++++> Oh, yeah.
Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now? <+++++> Sorry.
Sorry. <+++++> It's morphin time!
Aren't you gonna... <+++++> Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.
What about AndrÃÂ©? <+++++> Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.
Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom? <+++++> I thought that was just a rumour.
...love you. <+++++> Are you're hands still wet?
Ross? <+++++> I'm here.
You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just... <+++++> What?  Great, now I'm having a baby.
What? <+++++> Ooh, Ooh.
What? <+++++> I'm having... I'm having a baby.  I'm having a... Where's the phone? The phone?
Ross? <+++++> I'm hurt.
Hey Ross, look what I've got going here. <+++++> Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.
Yeah, save it for the cab, okay. <+++++> What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.
What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there. <+++++> Joey, get out of the fridge.
All right, all right. <+++++> What is that?
Yeah, like in a cab... <+++++> Save it.
Okay, hating this. <+++++> Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.
I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew. <+++++> That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on.
Okay, I 'm not gonna have one. <+++++> Neither will I.
All right I 'll have one. <+++++> So what 's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one.
See that is the problem with invisible dentists. <+++++> Why? Why can 't you go to him?
Yes, while I was in the chair! That 's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives! <+++++> Pheebs, come on, you didn 't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence.
Hey, is, is, is Chandler here? <+++++> No, no he 's not.
You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband. <+++++> What?  So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
Well, I 'm going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um...... <+++++> Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.
What did they do? <+++++> Well, they painted over the word  'Sapien' for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let's just leave it at that.
So, do you want me to watch Ben for you? <+++++> Yes, that 's what I was going to ask, thank you.
Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me? <+++++> You? You! Want to watch Ben?  Yes! That'd be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is.
Hey-hey, Ross? <+++++> Yeah.
I 've got a science question. <+++++> Hmm?
If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact  'Homo-sapien', is that why there extinct? <+++++> Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.
I know. <+++++> Hey! Everyone.
Hi! <+++++> How 's my little boy?
He 's perfect, he's never been better. <+++++> What 'd you do, take him whaling?
Monica. <+++++> Oh my God, he just said your name, that 's great! Good job Ben.
All right, we should call somebody. <+++++> And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn 't moving.
Are you, are you, are you sure it 's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child. <+++++> It 's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.
I did! <+++++> I know! I 'm saying you have to watch them all the time.
I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing! <+++++> Monica did it?
Monica did it? <+++++> Monica?
Yeah. <+++++> Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?
No. Why? <+++++> Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he 's leaving out 'e' and 'f.' It's like they just ah, I don't know, fell out of his head.
Really?! <+++++> Oh, and also, he 's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know...
You jerk! You know how much I love that kid! <+++++> Monica bang! Monica bang!  Ow!
All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area. <+++++> Can we please focus here, a naked man 's life hangs in the balance!
Okay, retract the device, retract the device. <+++++> He does not look happy.
No, I don't mind you touching my belly, but right now your hand is kind of blocking the part where the baby is gonna come out. <+++++> Hey!
Hi. <+++++> Hey Erica, welcome back to town!  Wow, look how big you've gotten.
That's because I'm pregnant! <+++++> Right, no, I understand.
Oh, ok. I'm just always afraid that people think I'm just fat with big breasts. <+++++> No, no, I knew .
Okay, well, stop staring at them. <+++++> She brought them up!  I didn't realize you were coming back so soon!
Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel. <+++++> Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?
Plus hotels are fun! My room has this little fridge full of free snacks! <+++++> Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...
I'll be right back. <+++++> Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.
Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name. <+++++> No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?
Yeah, it takes two incomes. <+++++> Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.
Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room. <+++++> Mhm,  packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.
All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos! <+++++> You got it! . All right, she's right, we gotta get serious.  Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!
Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn't know you guys had it in ya! <+++++> Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out.
Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves! <+++++> Bumming hard, guys, bumming hard.
Oh, he has a gig. I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know. My husband has a gig. <+++++> Yeah? Yeah, where is it?
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party. <+++++> Rock on!
Hey. <+++++> Hey, where's Rach?
Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second. <+++++> Great.
Hey Rach, hey you. <+++++> Here she is!
Come here, I'll make you a drink. <+++++> Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
You know, I had a chance to stop her too! <+++++> Yeah?
You know what? Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here . <+++++> Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?
Oh, you're so screwed. <+++++> Hey. What was that all about?
She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually. <+++++> Are you kidding? Oh my God...
Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying. <+++++> Oh, man, I'm not going to be able to handle this.  Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.
Uh, Rach? <+++++> Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.
So, I guess you're next. You're ready? <+++++> I don't think so.
That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic. <+++++> God! I can't believe she saved me for last.  Why are they taking so long?
I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well. <+++++> No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no! <+++++> Okay, here we go...
Oh...  Well... <+++++> Yeah...
I think I'm gonna take off. <+++++> Huh?
Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night. <+++++> What? I don't get a goodbye?
Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit. <+++++> Well, it needs to be plicit.
All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad? <+++++> No, I don't think so.
Mine was a humdinger <+++++> O-kay... I mean, don't I deserve anything? I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug?  NOT FROM YOU!
And say what? "You owe me a goodbye", I mean, he's got more pride than that. <+++++> THE HELL I DO!
THE HELL I DO! <+++++> I don't get a goodbye?
What? <+++++> Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.
Ross... <+++++> Oh no, maybe it's me , I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good...  IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris.
You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care? <+++++> That's what it seemed like.
I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me. <+++++> Fine, then why didn't you say something?
Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh! <+++++> Rach!
What? <+++++> You keep, you keep... You can't...
Ross, say something. Anything. <+++++> So you two are..?
Yeah. <+++++> And have you .. ed?
No, no, no! <+++++> But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?
Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts. <+++++> I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?
No, but you know what I mean. <+++++> Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you.  I'm fine!
Really? <+++++> Absolutely.  I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really,  I'm fine. I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. I mean, at first I was like..  But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this.
Ross.. <+++++> It's all working out! Me & Charlie, and you two. You know what we should do?
Calm ourselves? <+++++> No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!
Look, don't you think that will be a little weird? <+++++> Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!!
Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out.. <+++++> I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie!  Hi Joey.  And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend.  I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know.  Come, please come in. Come in.
Okay, well, we brought you some wine. <+++++> Oh! That is so thoughtful.  She's a keeper. And what did you bring me?
Uh, actually, that's.. <+++++> Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!
Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little... <+++++> What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?
Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink. <+++++> You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.
Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some. <+++++> Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.
Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready? <+++++> I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension.
No awareness. <+++++> We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?
We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go? <+++++> My fajitas!!
Oh, I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable? <+++++> Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!
Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on! <+++++> That is gonna hurt tomorrow!
Ooy. <+++++> And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is life without love?
Oh my god, are we supposed to answer? <+++++> O is for "oh, wow!" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.
Dude, are you okay? <+++++> Totally.
Ross, you don't seem okay. <+++++> I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining. I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.
Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off. <+++++> No!
I'm sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but this has been lovely. <+++++> Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.
You're on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay? <+++++> Okay.
Bye. <+++++> Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!
You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too. <+++++> Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.
No, no, it's just that it's getting late... <+++++> Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.
Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good. <+++++> I don't even know what that's for.
Morning. Here you go. <+++++> Thanks. Did you stay here all night?
Yeah. <+++++> So you took off my pants and shoes?
No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen. <+++++> What do you mean?
Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly.. <+++++> Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!
It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel. <+++++> Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?
That's what I hear, yeah. <+++++> This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?
Come on, I mean, you know me, you know... <+++++> Joey.
I'm crazy about her. <+++++> And she feels the same way?
I think so. <+++++> Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.
Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it. <+++++> No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?
No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this? <+++++> Yeah, I'm sure.
Oh, it 's so great to see you feeling like this! <+++++> Hey!
Hey! <+++++> Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.
Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah! <+++++> We were all pretty shaken up about it.
Wait, am I missing something though?  'Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way. <+++++> Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.
Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch!   And I 'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse? <+++++> You get the dollhouse.
Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you 've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground. <+++++> Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
Hey! <+++++> Hello.

Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler. <+++++> I-I know. Well if something comes up...

Hi! Remember me? <+++++> Hi! Yeah! Tommy 's in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in front of him, I think he's gonna snap.
Ross, I 'm gonna go. <+++++> Go? Why?
I don 't know. Could be because I don't feel like standing around all night waiting for some guy who may or may not scream. <+++++> But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream.
Good bye Ross. <+++++> Uh, oh-ho bye.
One. <+++++> One.
Tommy 's supposed to be here soon, we're going to lunch. <+++++> Look. Look, I wasn 't going to say anything to you, but... All right, I don't think you should be seeing Tommy anymore.
You don 't?! <+++++> No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.
Umm, or , maybe, I should stay away from all men. <+++++> No, it 's not just 'cause I'm jealous.  I mean I'm not, I'm not, I'm not jealous, okay? It's Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like,  banging his hands together! <+++++> Okay, fine, fine. You don 't want to believe me? No, that's fine.
Whoa!! <+++++> Whoa, sorry Tommy.
What 's in the cup, Ross? <+++++> Umm
What is in the cup?! <+++++> Okay, it 's coffee.
Ice coffee? Tell me it 's ice coffee! <+++++> It 's-it's hot
Why don 't you use ours across the hall, 'cause she has problems. <+++++> Oh-ho, whoa! Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled this hot coffee on you.
Yeah, but you didn 't. <+++++> No, but it 's-it's-it's hot!
Ross, would you just stop it! It 's getting really old. <+++++> I can 't believe no one believes me!
I do, I believe you. <+++++> You do Pheebs?
Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it 's one of those 801 numbers. Right? <+++++> Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah.
And yet, she 's still not hanging up the phone. <+++++> Hang it up! Hang up the phone!!
You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it. <+++++> Hey, you guys... I have great news.
Ross, we're kind of in the middle of diner here. <+++++> Oh, well, er, I already ate, but sure...!  Guess what happened at work today...
A dinosaur died a million years ago? <+++++> Try sixty-five million years ago, and then try sssshhhhhh.... My tenure review board met today and I hear it's looking really good.
Wow! <+++++> Yeah. Do you have any idea what this means in academic circles, uh? I am gonna get laid.
Hi you guys. <+++++> Hey.
No one wanted seconds, right? <+++++> No, no. I-I'm good.
Hey you guys... You're never gonna believe it. This headhunter called me. I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci. Gucci wants me. <+++++> I'm up for tenure.
Congratulations! <+++++> You too! What are the odds?
Oh God. I'm so sorry. <+++++> Hey! Wha-hoo! What's this?  Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?
Ross... <+++++> I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!
Congratulations! <+++++> This is the single greatest day of my professional career. Gunther, six glasses!
Six? You want me to join you? <+++++> Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good.  Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow.
Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla! <+++++> I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?
Oh it... good! Yeah, but I'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days. <+++++> Oh, you know what? You're gonna get it. I-I-I-I can feel it.
Ah, all right. Here's to Ross! <+++++> And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.
And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything. <+++++> But also knowing it means a lot.
But more importantly to full well-rounded lives. <+++++> ...that center around work.
To Ross! <+++++> Ross!
Ross! <+++++> You know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired.
Oh God! <+++++> No seriously. I have job security for life. You know, I never have to worry.  Oh, look at you. Look how happy you are for me.
No, it's not that. I got fired today. And I didn't get the other job. <+++++> Rach, I'm so sorry.
Oh! <+++++> Great. I feel like an idiot.
No, it's okay, you didn't know. <+++++> Oh...  Little heads-up would have been nice.
Ross, what is taking you so long? <+++++> I'm sorry, it's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway!
Sure, sure.  What's with the chair. <+++++> Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so...
Nice to see you. <+++++> Yeah! yeah, I got tenure!
Oh my God! <+++++> See? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. I've met him before?
Ross! That's Mark. From Bloomingdales? You were insanely jealous of him. <+++++> That is Mark?
Yes. <+++++> I hate that guy.
Oh. <+++++> No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him.
What? You don't want me to get a job? <+++++> Oh yeah, I'm sure he's gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary.
Ugh. <+++++> I'm serious. I just don't trust that guy, okay?
No. <+++++> She's still at dinner?
I guess. Why? Who's she with? <+++++> That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.
It's seven years ago.  My time machine works! <+++++> We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.
Hi you guys! <+++++> Hey, so uhm... How was dinner?
Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet. <+++++> Oh yeah? Yeah? I wonder why? What could that smarmy letch possibly want?
Oh Ross, come on. He's happily married. His wife just had twins. <+++++> Should we send something?
That's great! <+++++> Congratulations!
I know, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great... <+++++> Can we, can we just stop for a second? Who said something better would come along, huh? You didn't believe me. I told you everything was gonna work out.  You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is. <+++++> I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope! <+++++> I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
Let her know I like her? What are you, insane?  It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem?  I'm right, right? <+++++> Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once! <+++++> Okay, okay, what's going on?
Okay, they're just talking... <+++++> Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!! <+++++> What? What? What?!
And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law. <+++++> Oh!... Right!
Then we took a walk down to Bendall's , and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel... <+++++> That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice! <+++++> That's, that's nice twice!
Hey, I've been honing! <+++++> What was with the dishes?
Y'don't think that makes me seem a little... <+++++> ...desperate, needy, pathetic?
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy. <+++++> Hey! Hi!
You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I? <+++++> You-you had what?
Sex in his chair. <+++++> What, uh... what were you thinking?
I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol. <+++++> No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!
If it helps, I could slide over. <+++++> It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
Where are you going? <+++++> I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?
Ring dammit, ring! <+++++> Thanks.

So, um, did she... <+++++> Twice.
You guys okay? <+++++> I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...
Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone. <+++++> Nono, she's gone.
Sweetie, you think you can get in there? <+++++> I don't see why not.
I don't see why not. <+++++> Here's my retainer!
No. <+++++> I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
You're right. We'll go with the burgundy. <+++++> Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out.
Wait! We need shoes! <+++++> Okay. Um, how about these?
That's really a day shoe. <+++++> And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
Could we see something in a slimmer heel? <+++++> Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.
Mm. Unless we go with a different dress? <+++++> No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.
No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back. <+++++> Oh my God..
Is everything all right, dear? <+++++> Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.

Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy. <+++++> What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?
Oh no! My new Paolo shoes! <+++++> Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise! <+++++> I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff-

Uh Look Rach  Hey Ross is here! Hey look! It's my good friend Ross. Hey Ross. <+++++> Hey Joey.  Hey you.
Hey and look he brought flowers. Thanks Ross, but I 'm really more of a candy guy. <+++++> You 're weird today.   Listen I uh, wanted to talk to you about something.
Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too. <+++++> Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?
No. <+++++> What?
He pulled a quarter out of my ear! <+++++> Hey, where 's uh, where's mom?
Okay. Wow. <+++++> Uh Dad, Emma 's in the nursery. I'll take you now. If you want, but  I really want to talk to you.
Look at her, my first grandchild. <+++++> What about Ben?
Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and Rachel? <+++++> Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room.
Yay! It 's so exciting! Wow, you could've done that with us there. <+++++> Yeah right.
Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can 't talk to Rachel. <+++++> What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?
Noted. <+++++> I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?
Are you kidding me, I could stay and look at her forever. <+++++> Actually umm
Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y 'know what? I'll-I'll come back later. <+++++> Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I 'll guess just I'll come back.
Wanna peek? <+++++> No!
Come on! <+++++> Y 'know what? I don't like you without mom.  Come on.
Oh hey! Wait up! <+++++> Hi!
Congratulations! I didn 't want to say anything in front of Joey 'cause I didn't know if he knew yet. <+++++> What, that we had a baby? Come on let 's give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.
No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged! <+++++> What?
Oh, it 's a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven't done the secret thing in a long time. <+++++> Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn 't propose.
Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor? <+++++> I am a doctor! Y 'know what? I'm just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.
All right, me too.  Should we wake her up? <+++++> No! No, come on let her sleep! She 's so exhausted.
And so engaged. <+++++> What?  Oh my God! She- she thinks we 're engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we're engaged?!
Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y 'know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart. <+++++> I didn 't give her that ring!
Really? <+++++> No!
So whose ring is it? <+++++> It 's mine.
Is it an engagement ring? <+++++> Yes!
But you didn 't give it to her? <+++++> No!
But you were going to propose? <+++++> No!!
Huh, I might be losing interest in this. <+++++> Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybe kinda wanted ah start things up again.
Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment. <+++++> Look, I didn 't want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didn't want to either. But I don't, I don't understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?
No! No, she said you actually proposed to her. <+++++> Well I didn 't! I didn't propose!  Unless uh  Did I? I haven't slept in forty hours and it does sound like something I would do.
Hey. <+++++> Listen, I um I heard about the engagement.
Surprised? <+++++> And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um I didn't propose to you.
I know. <+++++> I don 't think you do.
You didn 't propose to me. Joey did. <+++++> Poor baby, you 're so tired. Rach, I didn't propose to you, Joey didn't propose to you, and Chandler didn't propose to you.
Uh You didn 't propose to me, Chandler didn't propose to me, but Joey did. <+++++> Joey proposed to you?
I can come back. <+++++> Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?
Well then why did you give me a ring? <+++++> Wait! Whoa-whoa, you you gave her the ring?
He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed. <+++++> Whoa! You were down on one knee?
Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didn 't I didn't propose! <+++++> Then what did happen?
Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out! <+++++> Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!
It wasn 't my ring! It's Ross's ring! That's why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose. <+++++> What?!
You were gonna propose to me? <+++++> Uhh No.
Well, this is awkward. {See? I told you so.} <+++++> But I-I was going to see if y 'know, maybe you uh, start dating again but that-I mean that-that was all, Rach.
Dude, step up! I proposed. <+++++> No, you didn 't!
Okay. <+++++> I can 't believe you told her I was going to propose!
I can 't believe you're not going to propose! <+++++> Hey, I 'm not going to rush into anything!
Oh my God! <+++++> What?
Okay. <+++++> Thank you.
Oh wow, this feels weird. <+++++> Good weird?
She 's perfect. <+++++> We 're so lucky.
We really are. <+++++> Look, I-I know it 's not a proposal and I don't know where you are, but with everything that's been going on and with Emma and I've been feeling
I know. I know. I 've feeling <+++++> Yeah?
Yeah. <+++++> Okay, well, that Wow, okay, well, umm then maybe, at least we can, we can talk about us again.
Yeah, maybe. <+++++> Well good, okay. I-I, kind of think y 'know if we if You're wearing the ring.
Wh-what 's that? <+++++> And you told Phoebe you were engaged.
I 'm sorry, what? <+++++> When you thought Joey proposed did did you say yes?
Right. So, it'll be the same except less sex with you. <+++++> So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?
Humiliating and noble! <+++++> You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising.
Ross, you did not come up with "got milk?" <+++++> Yes, I did , I did!  I should have written it down!
Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight? <+++++> Oh, I can't. I've got a date with that waitress, Katy, yeah, I know we've been only going out like twice, but I have a really good feeling about her.
Alright. Just give me your wallets and there won't be a problem. <+++++> What?
I have a gun <+++++> O-ok. Just relax, Phoene, just stay calm. . Oh my god, I can't find my wallet.
No. <+++++> What do you mean "no"? I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay.
Ross, nice to meet you. <+++++> Yeah, a real pleasure.
Ouh <+++++> Oh my god. Phoebe, you used to mug people?
Hey, hey! <+++++> Hey, you'll never guess what just happened Phoebe and I got mugged!
You okay?! <+++++> Yah, because Phoebe knew the mugger!
I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us. <+++++> You wanna know how she knew him?  Because Phoebe used to mug people.
She was a drug dealer! <+++++> Well, anyway, it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him, because  I was about to do some serious damage!
You were? <+++++> Yeah, it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marc's Comics you know, I-I-I was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week-
Wonderwoman! <+++++> Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone   when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says
Oh my god <+++++> I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book
Oh yeah! What was his superpower again? <+++++> A superhuman thirst for knowledge.
That's it. <+++++> Well, I-I better get to class  Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way, Phoebe?
Hey, you! <+++++> Hey!
Hey, how was class? <+++++> No one ever asked me that, what's wrong?
Nothing, I really wanna know. <+++++> Oh  Well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene
Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a confession to make uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid <+++++> Wh-What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.
You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl. <+++++> No, it wasn't.
Yes, it was. <+++++> No, it wasn't. You don't think I would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old
"Gimme your money, punk!" <+++++> Oh my god, it was you! I can't believe it, you you mugged me?
Yeah, and I'm so, so sorry, Ross, I'm sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat.  I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have have a great one! <+++++> It's not the best!
I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say <+++++> There's nothing you can say. That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me.
Really? Even more humiliating than <+++++> Hey, let's not do this!
Hey, Ross!  I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second? <+++++> Sure, go ahead. Whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead.
I just really wanted to apologize again and and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting. <+++++> Oh my god, crap from the street?
Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell or smoke.  Anyway, I was looking through it and I found "Science Boy" <+++++> Oh my god.  I never thought I'd see this again.  It's all here. What made you save it all these years?
I can't say, I just thought it was really good and maybe would be worth something some day. <+++++> You really thought "Science Boy" was worth saving!
Yeah but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here. <+++++> Still this is amazing Oh my god, thank you, Phoebe.
You're welcome. And thank you for "Science Boy". I learned a lot from him <+++++> You're welcome.
Wow, that's a big cable bill! Huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn on a Saturday afternoon?!  I was in the house! <+++++> Hey, uhm, Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that
that she was the huge guy that mugged you? Yah. <+++++> I see. You didn't happen to tell
everybody we know? Yeah. <+++++> Great. Thanks!
Hey guys! <+++++> Hi!
What are you talking about?! <+++++> Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town!  Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!!  I mean, way to go Ben!  Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition. <+++++> I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings
Okay guys, way to wish me luck! <+++++> Good luck! Go get 'em!
Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!! <+++++> Okay!!
What, so I gotta shut it down now? <+++++> All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.
It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad. <+++++> Yeah.
Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial? <+++++> Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather. <+++++> You're not his godfather.
What?! Are you kidding?! <+++++> Of course I am!  Okay, let's go godfather.
Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition! <+++++> Really? That's great!
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation , and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad . <+++++> Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad? <+++++> Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
I got it! Mine! <+++++> Hi.
Hey! How'd the audition go?! <+++++> Not so good.
Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's   "Audition didn't go so well.  Yeah it did?" <+++++> Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!
Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much. <+++++> Yes!! I knew it!!  Bye-bye! So long! Later!
Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad! <+++++> Yeah!
Man, this is gonna be kinda weird. <+++++> Yeah, it is.
Yeah. It's gonna be weird. <+++++> No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.
Hey! <+++++> Hi!
Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water. <+++++> Seriously that's a lot of cups.
Hey Pheebs!  Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something. <+++++> What's up?
Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition. <+++++> Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.
That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here! <+++++> Well, you just
I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben! <+++++> What?!
Well I mean, let me get the door first.  Oh, hi! No one. <+++++> Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
At least I care about his feelings! <+++++> What?!
Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn 't get it? <+++++> And why wouldn't he get it?
Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger! <+++++> Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
You just give him a spoon baby! <+++++> Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!
Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch! <+++++> You're kid's name is Raymond!
Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle. <+++++> Joey!
Ross! <+++++> Ben!   I mean, Ben! Ben!
Hey. <+++++> Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.
Yeah right! <+++++> No really, I-I am! I feel bad!
Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say,  "Hmm, noodle soup." <+++++> Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.
What you do mean? <+++++> I think, sub-consciously
Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me. <+++++> I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.
Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine.  Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor <+++++> No!
No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed. <+++++> There you go. Thank you!
Thank you! So, did-did he get it? <+++++> No.
Hey! <+++++> Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?
Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George. <+++++> Wow! How'd you get in there?
Okay, bye! <+++++> What the hell was that?!
What? <+++++> The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!
I was not flirting. <+++++> It was totally flirting.  "Somebody got a haircut "
Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all. <+++++> Yeah, right.
You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting. <+++++> I'm good.
I was not flirting. <+++++> And on your anniversary, for shame!
What's going on? <+++++> Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
I was not and oh God, shh! <+++++> Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl. <+++++> Well
Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people. <+++++> Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
Hm-mmm. <+++++> And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little
Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian! <+++++> This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.
Pizza delivery! <+++++> I'll get it! I will get that!
Hi! <+++++> Hi!
One uh, vegetarian pizza. That's $12.15. <+++++> Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like 8-year-old boys.
What?! <+++++> The uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I'm just saying I like it. The hair.
Oh. Thanks. <+++++> You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
You're welcome. <+++++> You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!
What? <+++++> This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!
What's goin' on? <+++++> Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine. <+++++> Really?!
Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women. <+++++> And thank you, for that.
But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing. <+++++> What?  What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.
Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me! <+++++> All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number!  And not the one on the menu!
What?! <+++++> Are you sure?
Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?! <+++++> Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
Why are you being weird? <+++++> Do you like it?
No, that would be,  "Why are you being cute?" <+++++> Okay, I'm working on my flirting.
All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her! <+++++> Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like  ten minutes left!
Pizza! <+++++> Oh, mine! Mine! Mine!  Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.
Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to <+++++> You'll see. Okay.  Oh, what's-what's her name?
Caitlin! <+++++> Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating like this.
It's uh, $12.50. <+++++> Okay,  so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh, wood-burning ovens?
No actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas. <+++++> Gas? Wow! Intense.
If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem. <+++++> Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?
Yeah. <+++++> They put that in.
What?! <+++++> The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.
Well okay! <+++++> A lot of other gas smells
Oh the humanity. <+++++> Meth-methane smells
Y'know what umm, actually I, I really, I should go. <+++++> Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!
Y'know what? That's okay, you guys have ordered so many that this one is on me! <+++++> Was I talking to her about gas?
I'm sorry. <+++++> Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there.
Ross? <+++++> Yeah?
Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought. <+++++> What do you mean?
Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number. <+++++> And she just gave you this?
Yeah! <+++++> Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors.
I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute. <+++++> Well that I can believe.
I'm comin' out! <+++++> And she's supposed to buy this?!
Thanks for picking out the earrings man. <+++++> Hm-mmm.
Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night? <+++++> Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?
Bye! <+++++> Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.
No, hey, it's been great. <+++++> Yeah?
Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump... <+++++> Yeah, that'll do it.
Wow! So, how are you? <+++++> I'm, I'm okay.
Really? <+++++> Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce.
Well, actually it... <+++++> No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people.
Wow, really? <+++++> Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me...
Sure, I know lots of girls. <+++++> Yeah? Any names come to mind?
Uh, there's a drunk Chinese guy. <+++++> Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.
Can I get you another glass of wine? <+++++> Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home alone.
Got stood up, huh? <+++++> Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.
Are you worried your date came, saw you, and left? <+++++> No!
I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left. <+++++> Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be.
Look; you got stood up, who cares? We're gonna show you a good time. Just sit and relax. In fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on the house. <+++++> Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to have sex tonight.
Ooh... <+++++> Just the crab cakes.
Just get out of here, okay? <+++++> What's - what's going on?
Eh, okay, the waiters have a little pool going. We have a bet on how long it'll take before you give up and go home. <+++++> What? You - you're making money off my misery?
Well, if you stay till 9 <+++++> This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way.
All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve. <+++++> Hey, what's wrong?
I just had a rough night. <+++++> Oh. Crab cake?
Eww! <+++++> Well, what happened?
Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but... <+++++> Monica told me you had a blind date.
Yeah. <+++++> I did, too.
Oh. <+++++> But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?
Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left? <+++++> Why does everyone keep saying that?
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up. <+++++> That bad?
Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this. <+++++> Female body inspector? What size is that?
Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show. <+++++> Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's just stupid.
Can you believe they're still not here? <+++++> I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the chances?
Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving? <+++++> No, they're not.
Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them. <+++++> You're wrong.
I am not wrong. <+++++> You're wrong.
No, I just talked to them. <+++++> I'm calling Mom.
Thanks. <+++++> Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.
Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's. <+++++> Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup. <+++++> Well, I'm off to Carol's.
Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her? <+++++> Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
No, she's at a faculty meeting. <+++++> Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but... Susan
Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but... Susan <+++++> Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
What's it look like? <+++++> Kinda like a big face without skin.
Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it. <+++++> Ok.  Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it. <+++++> Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby. <+++++> The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there? <+++++> You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice. <+++++> Do you uh, do you talk about me?
Yeah, yeah, all the time. <+++++> Really?
All right, I'm nine years old. <+++++> Oh, I hate this story.
Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming.  What? <+++++> I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping. <+++++> That's closer.
All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots. <+++++> Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
Ah! <+++++> Ok, Mom never hit.
Anytime you're ready. <+++++> Ok, ok, here we go.  Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
Just aim for the bump. <+++++> Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.
So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it. <+++++> Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want. <+++++> Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?
Hi, how's it goin? <+++++> Shh!  Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey!  Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
I did. <+++++> Does it always, uh--?
Keep singing! Keep singing! <+++++> Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.
I felt it! <+++++> Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.
Well, the turkey's burnt.  Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined. <+++++> Here we come, walkin' down the -this doesn't smell like Mom's.
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese? <+++++> I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked. <+++++> That's so sweet.
That's so sweet. <+++++> And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
I know. It's just such reckless spending. <+++++> I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! <+++++> Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back-  come here, Marcel-
Ross, you've got to do something about the humping. <+++++> What? It's, it's just a phase.
Well, that's what we said about Joey... <+++++> Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey! <+++++> What?
Where've you been? <+++++> At the vet.
She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she? <+++++> She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
Hey! He beat ya. <+++++> She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
So what does this mean? <+++++> I'm gonna have to give him up.
I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already? <+++++> I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
Isn't there any way you can keep him? <+++++> No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen. <+++++> Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice. <+++++> What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit. <+++++> Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
I'd say that chair's taking the brunt. <+++++> Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?
Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel? <+++++> Yes.
Does he, uh, fight with other animals? <+++++> No-no, he's, he's very docile.
Even if he were... cornered? <+++++> Well I, I don't know. Why?
Uh, how is he at handling small objects? <+++++> He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
How about a hammer, or a small blade? <+++++> Why- why- why would he need a blade?
...He's in. <+++++> He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane. <+++++> Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey. <+++++> Just, just say what you feel.
Marcel, I'm hungry. <+++++> That was good.
Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane. <+++++> Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.
Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely. <+++++> Marcel, c'mere, c'mere.  Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be-  Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.
Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the way there's no law against. And then we're gonna grab some food, so if you want... <+++++> ... finally...
Ooh... Dr. Geller! <+++++> God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you to call me that.
You gotta hear this, it's great... It's like free porn! <+++++> Weh...sigh
uhm... Is everything okay? <+++++> Yeah, It's just... I don't think I can do this...
Ooh... Is it because of what might be on the bedspread, because I saw that news report too, with the infra red and the ... I could just... <+++++> No, NO!  Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it.
I uhm... I completely understand. <+++++> Alright, I'm gonna go find them...  I just need a... need a before I can... you know.  Grandma... grandma... grandma...  Okay, I see you later.
Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well! <+++++> Hey, what are you guys doing?
Bye! <+++++> Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?
He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it... <+++++> Well, if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him?
You got it! <+++++> Thanks!  Thank you!
Other wall, people! Other wall! <+++++> Rach, you there?
Oh... okay, just hide! <+++++> Rach?
There's no room under the bed. <+++++> Is everything okay?
Yeah... <+++++> Hey.
Hi... <+++++> You know where Joey is?
...I really don't... <+++++> Can I talk to you for a minute?
Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall. <+++++> And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.
Uh-huh... right... yeah... <+++++> And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.
Oh, I know... I know it's been really hard for you. <+++++> Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?
That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say. <+++++> You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace.
Nothing... <+++++> Seriously... What is it?
Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here, come here... <+++++> What's wrong?
Well, maybe I can help. <+++++> Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do that again...
Hey! <+++++> You guys ready to go?
Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing. <+++++> Dude! You're not taking your Bible?
You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it? <+++++> Learn about Jesus...
Learn about Jesus... <+++++> Hey!
So, did you talk to Joey? <+++++> Uh, no... no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.
Yeah, sounds like a good idea... Dr. Geller! <+++++> Stop it!
PHD <+++++> You're filthy!
Hey, have you guys seen Monica? <+++++> Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.
Don't you just love it? <+++++> Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.
It's so... something... You go girlfriend! <+++++> You've never said that in your life, have you?
Not once. <+++++> I thought so.
Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie? <+++++> Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.
I understand... <+++++> No, I'll do it.
You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there. <+++++> Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty free".
I'm gonna get the lasagna. <+++++> Hey Rach...
Yeah! <+++++> Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?
Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah! <+++++> Hey!
Hey! <+++++> So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.
Yeah? <+++++> Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and..., well...
You kissed. <+++++> Wha...  What? What would give you that idea?
I saw you. <+++++> Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.
Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay. <+++++> What?
It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy. <+++++> Are you serious?
Yeah... Now I have something... <+++++> I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?
Oh... uh... look... before you... <+++++> No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous...
I am those things, yeah. <+++++> You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...
Dude! <+++++> Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...
I can't think of anything. <+++++> Thanks!
So hi! <+++++> Hi!
So you eh, you talked to Joey? <+++++> Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.
Oh! That's great! <+++++> Yeah!
Oh, so everything's okay? <+++++> Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing guy.
Ah... Well, obviously I think so too. <+++++> Well, I'm so excited about this.
Really? Excited? <+++++> Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...
That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams. <+++++> Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.
Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about. <+++++> Okay, shoot!
Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal. <+++++> OH NO!
What? What is it? <+++++> Oh, major shampoo explosion!
Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy. <+++++> Oh, it's all over everything. Why? Why me?
Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo? <+++++> I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?
Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and... <+++++> Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?
Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time. <+++++> Duh, you think?
He offered me one. <+++++> You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
Oh, God! Please, somebody say something. <+++++> So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?
I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable. <+++++> Okay.
My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. <+++++> All right, we'll work it out.
Thank you! Thank you! <+++++> Yeah, yeah!  You sure this is what you want?
I see. <+++++> Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this?
I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job. <+++++> Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it?
Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes? <+++++> I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.
You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron? <+++++> I didn't say we were brothers.
May I help you? <+++++> Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.
Oh right, uhm, Don? <+++++> Close. Ron.
Uh... What can I do for you? <+++++> Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.
Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this? <+++++> Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll see if she wants to come back.
Wow, that is tempting. <+++++> Look, she loved her job here. And let's face it
She is good! <+++++> Huh, I took a shot there.
But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do... Ah, it's not true, there is... nothing I want to do. <+++++> I see... Thanks very much.  Is this your son?
Yeah, his name is Ross.  What? <+++++> Oh, nothing, it 's just, it's close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?
Yeah, they're all he talks about, why? <+++++> How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. . I just heard it as you must have heard it and that 's not good. Let me start again. I'm a paleontologist, you'll be there with us and the touching refers only to bonesÃ¢ÂÂ¦ fossils!
You can really arrange that? <+++++> You let Rachel come back, and it 's done.
Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldn 't be the worst thing in the world. <+++++> Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life.
That 's great. I worry about little Ross. He's always reading, he's collecting rocks and he's obsessed with dinosaurs. <+++++> He 'll be fine.
Hi. <+++++> Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can 't sleep without it.
Oh, well, she 's asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her. <+++++> Ok.
Oh, you 're not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back! <+++++> Nooo!
Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me. <+++++> So, you 're not going to Paris.
No, I 'm still going. <+++++> Wh Ã¢ÂÂ¦ whÃ¢ÂÂ¦what?
When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! Isn 't that great? <+++++> Yeeeah!
Who is it? <+++++> It's me. Ron.  Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back.
This may surprise you, but re-hiring fired employees, is not my main job. <+++++> Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise?
Not good, Ron. <+++++> Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this  genuine pterodactyl egg  replica.
Wow, that's pretty cool <+++++> Huh? So? We have a deal?
Okay, you got it. <+++++> Yes! yes!
This is gonna make me very popular. <+++++> Oh,  Believe me, the ladies, they love it!
I meant with my son. <+++++> Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much.
Hi! <+++++> Hey!
You are never going to believe what happened to me today. <+++++> What?
Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money. <+++++> They did?
Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I don't even know what department that guy's in. <+++++> So, what are you gonna do?
Well, I took it. <+++++> That's great! So you're staying in New York!
YAY! WHOO! YAY! <+++++> You're excited, right?
Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great. It's certainly the easier choice... <+++++> Right!
Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can... <+++++> Uhm, I hadn't no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris. Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared.
Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have- Emma scared... But this is... fine. This is gonna be good. <+++++> You should go.
What? <+++++> It's what you want. You should go.
You really think so? <+++++> I really do.
But I already told Zelner that I would come back... <+++++> I'm sure he'll understand.
All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris. <+++++> Yeah...
Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross! <+++++> Yeah, yeah, oh!
Oh! Oh, I'm so happy. <+++++> Then I'm happy too.
Or... Dick. <+++++> Hey.
Hey. <+++++> Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.
Was it like a sneeze only better? <+++++> No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.
What was it? <+++++> Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out.
No!! <+++++> Come on you guys, it's no big deal!
Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!!  Huh. <+++++> Well what is it? Is it a mole?
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole. <+++++> Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?
Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter. <+++++> Ahhh.
Does a dog's lips move when he reads?  Okay, no they don't. <+++++> Hey guys!
Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's? <+++++> Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign.
Well what is it?! <+++++> He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.
Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples. <+++++> At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.
Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like,  "Awww, he's got a Ross." <+++++> Yeah, that'd be cool!
Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here.  What are you doing? <+++++> Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
Well that's not a third nipple. <+++++> No?
First of all, it's on your ass. <+++++> Well then, what is it?!
Thank you soo much for coming on such a short notice. Ladies and gentlemen, I've-I've-I've been practicing medicine for twenty-three years, and I'm stumped. <+++++> Whoa.
Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights!  Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away!  Oh, see you just need to find the right command. <+++++> Yes, and the dimmer switch.
I see him, you guys are just the worst hiders ever. <+++++> Hey Pete.
I love you. <+++++> I love you, love you.
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!! <+++++> Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!
Well if-if that 's what it is, then it's-it's crazy. <+++++> Monica 's right. We're talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can't just rush into this.
Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it 's just Jason's so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it's just better than having just like a really, really, really nice  butt.   Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck! <+++++> Good luck!
I 'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy. <+++++> Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don 't want to make it savory.
Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it. <+++++> Gimme this.
You must be Ross. <+++++> Hi.
I am Guru Saj. <+++++> Listen, I got to tell you I 've-I've never been to a guru before, so...
Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, I 've attended some of the finest medical schools in Central America. Well then, let's take a look at this skin abnormality of yours.  Come on, have a seat.  Eeh, huh. As I suspected, it's a koondis! <+++++> What 's a koondis?
I don 't know, what's a koondis with you?  Please, lie down! I've got a sav that oughta shrink that right up. <+++++> I guess it 's worth a try.
Oh sure, we should see results -Whoa!! Clearly not the way to go!! <+++++> What?! What?!
We appear to have angered it. <+++++> We?! We angered it?!
Oh, I think I see the problem. And I 'm afraid we're gonna have to use a much stronger tool.  Love. <+++++> Oh God!
Ross, there is absolutely no way this is going to come off unless you start to <+++++> Ow!!
Oops. <+++++> What was, what was that?
Well it 's gone. <+++++> What?! How 's that?
It got caught on my watch. <+++++> Hey!
Yeah, oh I 'm sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya, it's a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I'm so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, 'cause-Oh! I'm pregnant! <+++++> Pheebs, did you want a cookie?
Hey! <+++++> All right, here 's the ring.
Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes! <+++++> So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?
Oh, it 's awkward. It's awkward. It's awkward. <+++++> I sort 've already asked Chandler.
What?! He got to do it at your first wedding! <+++++> Joey, I figured you 'd understand. I mean, I-I've known him a lot longer.
I 'll never get to be a best man! <+++++> Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?
I can 't believe you're not picking me. <+++++> Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!
I 'm not even I'm not even <+++++> Fine, y 'know what, that's it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.
This is what I 've got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor. <+++++> Great. Great.
All right -oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I'd really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there. <+++++> Yeah. Tell ya what, let 's not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!
Hey guys, what are you doing? <+++++> Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.
Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one. <+++++> Yeah, see, I don 't think it's gonna that difficult considering this one won 't be taking place in the basement of a Pizza Hut.
Oh, I 'm Ross. I'm Ross. I'm too good for the Hut; I'm too good for the Hut. <+++++> Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey, just remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?
You got it. <+++++> Okay, see ya later.
Yeah? <+++++> Good call!
Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther don 't-don't forget your shirt. <+++++> Hey-hey, what are those?
Oh, little party favours, check it out! <+++++> Wow! Yeah!
Great! <+++++> Smooth man. Yeah, you got some chilie on your neck.  Well, I just want to say, thanks everyone, this- this was great. And hey! See you guys Monday morning.  Thanks Joey.
Oh, hey, don 't forget your shirt. <+++++> Oh, thanks!
Ugh! I don 't know what I'm going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don't care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is? <+++++> Hey guys!
Hey <+++++> I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y 'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so
So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that 's nice! <+++++> Yeah, right!
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those <+++++> That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? <+++++> Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
Yeah, the stripper stole it. <+++++> My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
Well, I think it all started when you said,  "Hey Joey, why don't you be my best man." <+++++> All right-all right, fine! I-I 'm gonna call the cops!
Dude, I screwed up, you don 't have to turn me in! <+++++> Not on you! On the stripper!
Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they 're gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders. <+++++> Okay, well, we 'll call the company that sent her!
I did that too! They wouldn 't give me her real name or her number. They said, "If I bothered them again they'd call the police." I said, "If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring!" <+++++> So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there 's nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!
All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won 't recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I.  You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I'll be uh, Mr. Wong. <+++++> Diverse.
Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk?  Hey, Joey? <+++++> Where 's my ring? My dead grandmother's wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
Yeah! <+++++> We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
If anything should happen to him <+++++> Joey! The vet said it 's a simple procedure.
Somebody lose a ring? <+++++> Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much!
Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this. <+++++> No, that 's all right.
Now, don 't argue with me <+++++> Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you guys.
Really? <+++++> Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are- are my I mean, I 'm lucky to have just one good
What a baby. <+++++> Total wuss!
Ohh, yeah. <+++++> Well, is this Hillary your HOT assistant chef Hillary?
Yeah. <+++++> The one that always stares at me when I come in?
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way. <+++++> Still I could tell. She was into me.  Well, why don't you set us up?
I don't think mine likes me either. <+++++> Maybe it's a universal thing?
Hey. <+++++> What's up?
What happened to your teeth. <+++++> I whitened them.
Really. <+++++> Yeah. What do you think.
Well, I think I shouldn't look directly at them. <+++++> Come on, seriously.
Yeah, what was wrong with your old human teeth. <+++++> Ahh, I-I did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to.
How much longer? <+++++> A-A day.
Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary? <+++++> I know. That's why I did it.  Come on, are they really that bad?
Yeah. <+++++> Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh
Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white.  Nope. Okay, colors that don't work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple. <+++++> I don't know what I'm going to do. That date starts in like an hour.
Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn't look so bright. <+++++> Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
I'm just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you. <+++++> Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We're not 13 anymore.
Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working. <+++++> But, won't she notice I have makeup on?
Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on. <+++++> What??
All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see. <+++++> No. I am not putting on makeup.
And after that, what could I do except become a chef. <+++++> Mmm-Hmm.
And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant. <+++++> Mmm.
You know, you're a really great listener. Most guys I go out with, they just talk and talk. <+++++> Mm-Hmm.
After a while it's like, shut your mouth, you know? <+++++> Hmm-Hmm.
I've probably been talking too much. Why don't we talk about you a little bit? <+++++> Mmm-Unmm.
Come on. I want to know. <+++++> Hmm-Hmm-Hmm.  Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let's talk more about you. Hmm.
I've had a really good time tonight. <+++++> Mmm.
You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date. <+++++> Hmm-Hmm-Hmm.  Me, neither. I've had a really good time too, you know.
Are you going to eat that bread? <+++++> Ohh, I just like the smell.  Mmmm.
You make me laugh. <+++++> Hmm-Hmm.
Would you like to move over to the couch? <+++++> Mmm-Hmm.
Maybe I'll just turn the lights down a little. <+++++> How about all the way.
Okay. <+++++> Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster?  So, ahh, where were we?
Are those your teeth?? <+++++> Ohh, you can see them, huh?
Yes. They're insanely white. <+++++> I-I, did that for you.
What's a matter with you? <+++++> What's a matter with me? You've got a black light. It's 1999!
 <+++++> 
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me! <+++++> You're right, you're right, it is.
 <+++++> 
Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn 't even be an actor! <+++++> Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn 't go well but it really did go well?
Yeah, did I fool ya? <+++++> Totally!
Oh, it went amazingly well! <+++++> Great!
Oh my God! <+++++> Wow!
And I know both of them, they 're really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who's always getting chased by those big flowers <+++++> Oh, I love that guy!
Oh-oh, what are you doing? <+++++> What am I doing?
Well, it is overdue. <+++++> Look, don 't worry. Okay? You're gonna be fine.
There 's just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don't know if you'd understand. <+++++> Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
 <+++++> 
 <+++++> 
It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone. <+++++> Oh-oh really?
Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash. <+++++> What?
Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away. <+++++> You-you-you-you  threw my sandwich away!
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me. <+++++> What?
Oh come on! <+++++> What?
That's how they do pants! <+++++> Yes, yes it is. In prison!
Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!! <+++++> I didn 't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn't finish the whole letter!
What?!! <+++++> I fell asleep!
You fell asleep?! <+++++> It was 5
Y'know I can 't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!! <+++++> FINE BY ME!!
Wow!  Well then I 'll just have to carry you. <+++++> That 'll be a neat trick, when you're,  when you're dead!
Ross, you don 't have to yell. <+++++> There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired.
I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like,  "Ooh, where'd Ross go?" <+++++> Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac
Yeah? <+++++> Oh my God. I mean
He 's holding us back. <+++++> Totally.
Hi! Oh, Ross, don't forget, we have that doctor's appointment tomorrow! <+++++> Right.
Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby? <+++++> No-no, we talked about it. We don't want to know. All we care about is that it's happy and healthy.
Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute! <+++++> And smart!
Popular. <+++++> With an aptitude for science.
Oh yeah! I've come up with a bunch of ideas! <+++++> Really? Me too!
Uh huh! If it's a girl, Phoebe, and if it's a boy, Phoebo! <+++++> Maybe. But it wouldn't hurt to have a backup, you know? Uh, Rach-Rach, what were you thinking?
Okay! I was thinking if it's a girl, how about Sandrine? It's French. <+++++> Huh. That's a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.
Okay fine, what do you have? <+++++> Well, OK, it's for a boy. Well, I know it's a little out there, but Darwin.
Yeah, by Sandrine. <+++++> You're just saying that 'cause I said no to your name!
How-how about you each get five vetoes? <+++++> All right.
All right. <+++++> That sounds fair.
Yeah! I don't think you're going to need it though. Okay, check this out. If it's a girl, Rain. <+++++> Veto.
Why? <+++++> Rain? Hi. Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat.
I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show! <+++++> Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher?
Ross, why do you hate our child? <+++++> Fine, you go.
Okay, James. <+++++> Huh.
But only if it's a girl. <+++++> Oh, veto. How about-Ooh, I like Ruth! What about Ruth?
Oh! I'm sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton? <+++++> Veto. Stewart?
Veto. Sawyer? <+++++> Veto. Helen?
Okay! All your tests look fine. Now, are you two interested in knowing the sex of the baby? <+++++> Uh, no. No, we're not.
That's right. But if you don't want to know <+++++> No, no, we want to wait, right?
So, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest? <+++++> What? Rach! Come on, that's terrible! They're uh they're babies. They're-they're all beautiful.
Third one from the left? <+++++> Yeah, why is it staring at me? I think it knows I'm talking about it.  Don't-don't you-Wh-Wha-Hey!!
What?! <+++++> You're looking!
I didn't! <+++++> I saw you!
Okay fine, I did. But I didn't see anything, I swear. <+++++> Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!
Okay, but Ross just listen to me <+++++> No, no, no, no! Don't tell me! I don't want to know!
But I couldn't even if I wanted to, because I don't know! I swear; I didn't see anything, and I don't want to know! It was just a momentary lapse. <+++++> Momentary lapse. Don't-don't you have any self-control?
Hey. <+++++> Hey.
You know what? I've been thinking about it. I'm really coming around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that. <+++++> Rach, I-I can't tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind? Unless, you know we're never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. You know it's a boy!
I didn't see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name. <+++++> I don't think so! You're just giving me Ruth so you'll get to name it when it's a boy, and that's when you'll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.
I would-Sequoia? <+++++> Veto.
Fine. <+++++> Unless   You anticipated that I would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named Ruth! Well, I'm not falling for that! Okay? Ruth is off the table!
But Ross, you want the name Ruth! <+++++> Not like this!
What? <+++++> That's right. The student has become the master.
Ross, I swear, I don't know. <+++++> Oh, come on, you know it's a girl!
A what?! <+++++> You really didn't know?
We're having a girl? <+++++> No.
That's what you just said! <+++++> No.
You said girl! <+++++> Yes. I'm I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm not! We're having a girl! Sometimes I can't believe it's with you-But still! We're having a girl! <+++++> I know! I know. You know what? I'm putting Ruth back on the table!
Oh, yes! We'll have ourselves a little baby Ruth <+++++> Permission to veto.
Honey, cover it up with the boat! <+++++> Hello?
Yes we're all in here and we would love for you to join us! <+++++> Well hey! What's going on? Ooh, cool boat--Oh, no.   Hey, did you, did you tell them?
We're having a girl. <+++++> Oh, wow! Yay! Wow! Hooray! Oh, man!
Who 's cell phone is that? It's just so annoying; everywhere you go. <+++++> I think it 's coming from your bag.
Oh my God! I 'm going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can't make lunch. <+++++> So apparently I 'm available for lunch.
I can 't. I'm busy. I'm apartment hunting. <+++++> You 're moving?
Yeah, I can 't live with Joey once the baby comes. I don't want my child's first words to be,  "How you doin'?" <+++++> So does-does Joey know you 're moving?
Well, I haven 't discussed it with him yet, but I know he's gonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book. <+++++> That 's not really porn.
Not so much. <+++++> Hey, y 'know what and if you're looking for a place? I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.
Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view? <+++++> Well I don 't know, but how-how great would that be huh? You living in my building. I could help take care of the baby. I can come over whenever I want.  With your permission.
Yeah that would really be great. <+++++> Yeah.
Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn 't. I mean if she just died this morning out of respect. <+++++> Yeah. No. No you 're right.
Shall we? <+++++> Yeah.
Yes? <+++++> Hi. I 'm Ross Geller. I live in the building.
And I 'm Rachel, an admirer of the building. <+++++> I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I 'm so sorry for your loss.
She didn 't pass. <+++++> What?
My mother 's still alive. <+++++> Oh, thank God!
Are you close with her? <+++++> Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in  the laundry room.
You speak Dutch?  Zeer vereerd een vriend van mijn moeder te ontmoeten. <+++++> Y 'know I would it's just painful.
Jij spreekt Nederlands? Dat is te gek. Heb je familie daar? (Translation <+++++> Yeah, we 're done.
Ezel. <+++++> Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?
Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools? <+++++> Really?!
No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler. <+++++> Sweet!
All right, well finish your coffee; let 's go. <+++++> Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.
To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you 're not gonna be on TV! <+++++> No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.
Oh, you 're switching apartments? <+++++> It 's not for me, it's for Rachel.
But Rachel has an apartment. <+++++> Yeah, but when the baby comes she 's gonna want to move.
She is? <+++++> Yeah, you didn 't expect her to live there with a baby did you?
I guess I didn 't really think about it. <+++++> Ezel!  Hey Gunther! You 're an ezel!
 <+++++> Damnit!
It 's not looking good. <+++++> Oh.  Oh. Well I uh, I brought her some bloemen.
That 's so sweet.  Would you like to come in and say good-bye? I'm sure it would mean a lot to her. <+++++> Oh I don 't know that it would.
Well, her memory is pretty much gone. <+++++> All right then.
Isn 't that great? <+++++> Ezels!!
I know. <+++++> Well, we should probably get going.
Well, maybe you don't need them. <+++++> My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.
Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious. <+++++> G'night.
Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now. <+++++> Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?
Uhhhooo. <+++++> C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them.
Well, there's you. <+++++> Better not be doin' these in order.
Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo. <+++++> Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.
Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him. <+++++> Really?
Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh. <+++++> Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.
God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was... <+++++> Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?
Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo. <+++++> Knock-knock.
But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had. <+++++> Until now.
Hey. They're just trying to decide somehting. <+++++> Good, good, good. So, is uh, was your moustache, did, used to be different?
No. <+++++> Oh. How do you uh, ya know, keep it so neat?
I have a little comb. <+++++> Oh. And what do you call that?
Agghhh. <+++++> So were you in Nam?
No. You have got it completely wrong. John Savage was deerhunter, no legs, John Voit was coming home, couldn't feel his legs. <+++++> No, no way. You've got it totally the other way around my friend. John Voit was...
Honey. <+++++> What, what oh....
So, he's on the show, he knows what happens. <+++++> Yeah.
Did they just kill off Joey? <+++++> No.
Joey. <+++++> Open up. We want to talk to you.
We came over as soon as we saw. <+++++> How could you not tell us?
Hey. <+++++> Hey.
Ohh, brisk tonight. <+++++> Oh man.
Let's never speak of this. <+++++> You got it.
Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was. <+++++> Who?
All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty. <+++++> Wow!
No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses. <+++++> Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it.  Or you just do it.
Yeah, that makes sense. <+++++> Over my dead body!
I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous. <+++++> So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.
Woo-hoo, stuud! <+++++> What's she look like?
I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy... <+++++> Get out!
Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way. All right, I'll see you guys later. <+++++> Bye, Richard.
Aww, Rach, I think you look cute  And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon . <+++++> Get away from me I said no!
Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him <+++++> Bye.
Hi. <+++++> Are you all right?
Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time. <+++++> Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride.
Okay, I'll see you after the thing. <+++++> Okay, good luck
Why the hell didn't you tell me! <+++++> I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'
Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes. <+++++> Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad.
Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast here. Thank you.  I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel... <+++++> What?!
No, no, no now in all seriousness, its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight, and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out! <+++++> Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...
Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding? <+++++> Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.
Oh dear God. <+++++> Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis.   What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me  Cheers.
She you in the parking lot. <+++++> No, Rach!
Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least one of your weddings . See now, tonight, all I <+++++> Marenge,
"...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody.." <+++++> Everybody!
Ooh, oh, oh, that's her. <+++++> Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind.
OH.....MY.....GAWD!! <+++++> OH.....MY.....GOD!!
I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you. <+++++> Hey you guys.
Hey. <+++++> Uh, sweetie we've gotta go.
NO! <+++++> No?
No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table? <+++++> Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.
You go girl. I can't pull that off can I? <+++++> Excuse me, your, your, your wind?
Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow? <+++++> You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that.
What is it? <+++++> I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it.
See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh. <+++++> What, what's that?
It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good. <+++++> Open it, open in.
Oh my God. <+++++> Woah.
Look at this, how did I spend so much money? <+++++> Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due.
Ahh. <+++++> What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?
My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do. <+++++> Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World.
What? <+++++> That audition.
That's a two line part. <+++++> Joey, you owe $1100 at I Love Lucite.
So what. <+++++> So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money.
Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic. <+++++> Toilet paper?
Yeah. <+++++> Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic.
Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend. <+++++> I am your friend.
Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.' <+++++> But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.
Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe. <+++++> Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another.
Look, I don't wanna hear this right now. <+++++> Huh, I'm just saying...
Well don't just say. <+++++> Ya know, maybe, maybe I should just go.
Ok. <+++++> Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok.
Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose. <+++++> 
They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right. <+++++> No look I wasn''t right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey.
Thanks Ross. <+++++> Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger. I can't tell you how much respect I have for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition.
I went. <+++++> Great, how did it go?
I didn't get it. <+++++> Good for you.

So Ross, are you gonna bring Mona? <+++++> Yeah. Yeah, I think I will.

Oh really?! You think you 're stronger? Why don't you prove it? <+++++> Oh I 'll prove it! I'll prove it like a theorem!!

They made you head of the department! <+++++> No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!  Why didn 't I get head of the department?
Yeah, it 's the new building on Avenue A. <+++++> What?! That-that 's all the way cross town, I'm supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.
Ooh, dude. That 's not gonna happen. <+++++> Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! I 'm the teacher!!

Well, why didn 't you just take a cab? <+++++> Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets it 'll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I? Rockefeller?
Well you 're not gonna be able to keep doing this. <+++++> Well I have to. Okay? If I don 't, they'll take the class away from me. And I already put it in my family newsletter.

Of course we 'll help! Yeah! We'll be here! <+++++> Thanks!
This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller. <+++++> It-it 's great to meet you Paul.
I usually prefer Elizabeth 's boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens. <+++++> Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.
So Ross, what your problem? <+++++> Eh-wh -Excuse me?
Why can 't you get a girlfriend your own age? <+++++> That 's funny. Umm .  It's not funny.
I don 't like you going out with my daughter Ross. <+++++> Okay. I can, I can see that. Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind.
Okay. <+++++> What?
Fine! Two minutes. Go. <+++++> This is -you-
1 minute 50 seconds. <+++++> Okay, umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like this before. I mean, I mean I 've been in um, relationships in general, uh but I have never done it with a student-I mean I not-not it! I mean, I mean I don 't-We haven't done it. Uh, I mean, I mean, we 've-we've-we've done stuff.  Okay, okay, a joke, a joke-lighten the mood. Umm, two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish.
I 'm Irish. <+++++> And the Irish guy wins the joke!
How crazy that we 'd run into you! <+++++> Oh God, thank you!  Umm, uh, Mr. Stevens I 'd like you to meet my friends uh, this is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.
I get that a lot. <+++++> Okay umm, why don 't we all take a seat, y'know? And uh, and I'll get us all some uh some coffees--Yeah, why don't you.  Uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y'know? Whatever pops into your head.
A part of him did yes. <+++++> Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth.  So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
Ross, Joey is not here. <+++++> Okay, I 'll just wait for him in here!
Yeah Ross it 's okay, it's me, Mr. Stevens. <+++++> Oh! Oh my God! I didn 't even see you!
I 'll call you later. Bye Ross. <+++++> What-what-what the -how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
Well, y 'know he lost his keys so he was looking for them <+++++> In your mouth?!
No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y 'know, for like two hours, and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee. <+++++> You were at the coffee house!
Ross, what 's the big deal? So I kissed the guy! <+++++> He is my girlfriend 's father, okay? It's-it's, it's weird!
Wh -You dated my sister! <+++++> That was different!
What? Why?! <+++++> This is weird for me!
Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let 's face it, so far the guy's not lovin' ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner, y'know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer! <+++++> How is that important?
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I 'm gonna go to the bathroom. <+++++> Yeah, take your time.
Yeah, take your time. <+++++> Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn 't as bad as-as
Ross, look, I know I 've been giving you a lot of jabs and it's partly because I'm very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told me and the many, many,  many stories that Rachel has told me that, well  you're not  all bad. <+++++> Not all bad.
And anyhow, I 'm sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to understand that I  still look at Lizzie like she's a twelve-year-old girl. <+++++> Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.
I beg your pardon? <+++++> No! No! Not -I don't mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, who's umm six and I still think of him as a baby.
You have a son? <+++++> Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I 'm sure you are with your wife!  Oh, I'm sorry!  It's unbelievable!
Oh we were, but that was just a , I mean that was just a big drunken mistake. <+++++> You 're back.
Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives? <+++++> Y 'know what? I-I-I I-I have had enough of this! Y'know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you've got a problem with me, frankly
Are you yelling at me?! <+++++> God no!
Really?! <+++++> Well if it doesn 't matter to her, it doesn't matter to me!  Still not yelling!
Wow. What can I say?  This doesn 't make me like you any better! <+++++> That 's okay, I'm not so crazy about myself right now either.
Then we agree? <+++++> Uh yeah, I guess -Yeah! I guess so.
I like Ross. <+++++> Ohhh! Kids!
Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is! <+++++> That 's okay Rach, we're not liking Ross right now.
Well Monica just told me that they don 't. <+++++> Yeah, they don 't like you.
Do you know why? <+++++> I dunno, maybe it 's because you're really sarcastic. Or maybe it's cause you uh-
Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown. I thought you guys might like to come. <+++++> For real?
Ye-ye, we go to yours! <+++++> Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it 's my sister. But, uh, uh y'know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon! <+++++> And the place looks so nice!
Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody! <+++++> Happy Thanksgiving!
Well, this has been great! <+++++> See ya!
Whoa whoa whoa! Where 're you goin'? <+++++> Oh, oh, we did say we 'd stop by this little thing Joey's roommate is having.
Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl? <+++++> Some would say she 's attractive, yes.
Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they 're gonna be, be drinkin' and dancin, and we really wanna go! <+++++> Dude, we were good!
Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy. <+++++> Oh, but-but it is, uh, it 's just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
Look at it, isn 't it beautiful? <+++++> Yeah, yeah, what is it?
Chandler! <+++++> Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd 's Pie!
Oh man! Now she 's gonna start all over! We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world! <+++++> No, no, we will. We just won 't tell her she messed up.
Just let her serve the beef-custard thing? <+++++> Yeah, it 'll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!
What? <+++++> Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.
You do? Why? <+++++> Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
What?! Why did you do that? <+++++> I don 't know, aheh, your's was the first name that-that popped into my head, I'm I'm sorry. I-I didn't think it would matter.
How could it not matter?! <+++++> How was I supposed to know we 'd end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
What about all that  "friends forever" stuff? <+++++> I don 't know, I-I was all high.
The reason we haven 't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this? <+++++> Okay, okay, I 'll tell 'em it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
You! It 's not like it's a big deal! You-you don't still do it or anything! <+++++> Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
Ross, if you don 't tell them, then I will! <+++++> Okay, fine!
Ross! Can I talk to you for a second? <+++++> Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can 't? Okay.
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert. <+++++> What?! What is with everybody? It 's Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!
Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they 're all gonna' make fun of her, do you want that? <+++++> Okay, okay, we 'll just get everyone to act like they like it. That- that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie!
What 's up, Ross? <+++++> So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?
Yeah! <+++++> And um...You look nice today.
Oh no. No Ross, don 't do this. <+++++> What?
I just- I don 't think us getting back together is a good idea. <+++++> Eh?
I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y 'know? And it's probably really hard for you to be alone right now. <+++++> You 're alone.
I like it. <+++++> Are you kidding?
Ross? Let 's go. <+++++> Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
Alright, you know what? That 's it. You've had your chance. <+++++> Wha-what?
What?! <+++++> You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
Yes. <+++++> Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I 'm sorry.
What happened son? <+++++> I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!
Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird. <+++++> Hey!
Hey! <+++++> Hey! Are you ready yet?
Yep! You got the tickets? <+++++> Oh! Got  'em right here,  check!
Woo-hoo!! <+++++> Yeah, cheerie-o!
Hey, y 'know what? I was wrong. <+++++> Well, we 're all here! I guess we should get going!
Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your wedding, but I don 't-can't get up. <+++++> Oh, I 'll-I'll come hug you.
Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper? <+++++> Yeah.
Oh, have a great wedding! <+++++> Thanks.
Oh. <+++++> So, we 're off.
Have fun! <+++++> Thanks!  Ugh, I can 't believe you're not gonna be there!
Oh, I know. <+++++> So-so come! Why don 't you come?
What?! <+++++> To London! Come to London. Please? It 'll mean so much to me.
Yeah, well, I gotta work, I 'm sorry. <+++++> Why-why can 't you take a couple of days off?
Because, I can 't! Ross, I told you, no. I can't. <+++++> This is my wedding.
All right, y 'know what? We really are late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!! <+++++> Fine. You 'll-you'll watch it on video when we get back.
Thank you. <+++++> All right, let 's go! Bye, Pheebs!
and that was all before 10 o'clock. The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We're not gonna be <+++++> Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily,  honey, okay?
Well, up yours too! <+++++> What?! No! No! That 's-that's time-out!
Sorry. <+++++> Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything 's gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come on.
Chicken Kiev? <+++++> Um-hmm! Doesn 't that sound delicious at the last minute?
Yeah, y 'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella.  So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married! <+++++> Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily 's parents got married here.
Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are we going to do? <+++++> It 's all right! Everything's gonna be all right.
How 's it gonna be all right?! <+++++> Uh-huh, I see that.
Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened. <+++++> What? What?
Hello? <+++++> Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we 'll be able to find a new place for the wedding.
We don 't have to. <+++++> Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit. <+++++> She said what?
She said,  "If I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it." <+++++> Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister 's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?  This isn't right.
I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, I 'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right. <+++++> I can 't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
Don 't you point your pants at me!  We have no choice! Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about. <+++++> The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we 're getting married.
So what are you saying? It 's now or never? <+++++> No. I 'm saying it's now.
Or? <+++++> There 's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
It 's not the pants. It's you that is backwards. And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all! <+++++> No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please -
Hey! <+++++> Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
Yes, I did! And you are welcome! <+++++> Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
Wait up! <+++++> Hey-hey, since you 're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?
She said that?! <+++++> Yeah.
Why?! <+++++> I don 't know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.
Oh my God. You 're even dumber than I am! <+++++> Excuse me?
Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding? <+++++> I don 't know. A month?
Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That 's what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top.  Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was. <+++++> I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.
Sometimes we were. <+++++> Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?
Okay. <+++++> Come on.
Oh God. <+++++> Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y 'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles
And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and  You go. <+++++> But-but, if you don 't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time. Really, it's fine, whatever you want.
It 's perfect. <+++++> And, I don 't know, if it starts to rain
Hey. <+++++> Hi. Mom. Dad.
Ohh, I thought that you.... <+++++> Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
What the hell!!! <+++++> what's up, Dad?
Flowers, liquor, recarpet first floor. New guest bath, landscaping. I'm paying to remodel this guys house.  I'm going to give that son on a bitch, a piece of my mind. <+++++> Dad, dad, please. Look I don't want anything to upset Emily tonight. Alright, she's had a hard enough couple of days as it is.  Now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?
Ahh, then you have to give us the lawn ornaments. <+++++> I go back there with lawn ornaments, he's going to laugh in my face.
There's no way in hell, I'm paying for it. <+++++> Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.
Morning, Ross. <+++++> I'm getting married, to..day!!
Yeah you are!! <+++++> Ahh, whoo-hoo!!(He runs back out the door.
Okay. <+++++> I do. I do. I do.
Oh yea, your right. It's the second one. <+++++> Really?
Hey, you keep pushing me on this, my foots going to meet the middle of your ass. <+++++> Dad!!
What-what's going on?! <+++++> Nothing, nothing. Everything's under control.
You want a piece of me, sir? Is that what your saying?  You want a piece of me? <+++++> Okay! Okay! That's it!! Parents!! Parents!! Back away!! All right, this is our wedding day!
What was all that about? <+++++> It was...This disagreement over... My god. You...you look beautiful.
Ohh... Oh! You were not meant to see me before the wedding. It's bad luck. <+++++> You know what, I think we've had all the bad luck we're going to have.
You know what, I think we've had all the bad luck we're going to have. <+++++> My God. Rachel!  Your here. I can't believe it.  What happen? Why are you here?
Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross... <+++++> I Ross...
Take thee, Emily... <+++++> Take thee, Rachel... Emily.  Emily.
Okayyyyy, open up! <+++++> What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!
Oh no-no-no, it 's only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners. <+++++> Yay!!
Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party? <+++++> I don 't know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there's this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.
No-no, I don 't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?! <+++++> Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?
Kathy 's with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude! <+++++> Dude, we are sooo gonna party!
Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy? <+++++> Mike  "Gandolf" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world.
I 'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow! <+++++> I 'm gonna call after you!
This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore! <+++++> Woooo!!!
Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book? <+++++> Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!
Well, why do you call him Gandolf? <+++++> Gandolf the wizard.  Hello! Didn 't you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
Oh yeah, it 's beautiful country up there. <+++++> Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
All right, I 'll see you guys. <+++++> Whoa-whoa-whoa!
I have an audition, but I 'll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon? <+++++> Somewhere maybe along the equator?
Hello.   It 's Gandolf!!!  So, are you in town?   Oh, well, well maybe next time then. <+++++> What happened?
He 's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago. <+++++> Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you 'd be out partying with Gandel-worf. <+++++> It 's Gandolf, and he's not coming.
So you 've been sittin' around here all mornin'? <+++++> No! I balanced my checkbook.
Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players. <+++++> I can 't believe he didn't come!
Oh-no, y 'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night! <+++++> Yeah! We 'd meet, we'd meet total strangers, and hang out with them!
Well, we could do that! <+++++> There 's other stuff too.
We 'll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on! <+++++> Yeah!
Yeah! <+++++> Yeah!!
Yeah!! <+++++> It 's not like we don't know how to party!!
And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again? <+++++> Yeah!!!
All right!! <+++++> Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?
Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face? <+++++> Yeah.
Yeah, all right. <+++++> Okay.
So, we 're having fun, right? <+++++> Yeah.
We don 't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing. <+++++> I 'm kinda beat.
Are you serious?! <+++++> Yeah.
Yeah, but uh, I don 't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf. <+++++> Yeah, me too.
I can 't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad. <+++++> I 'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.
I 'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place. <+++++> How sad are we?
Y 'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour! <+++++> Yeah!
Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends. <+++++> Yeah!
Yeah! <+++++> And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!
So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not? <+++++> Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he 's so cheap, he'd never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough?
Yeah, they 're fine. <+++++> Yeah?
If anyone asks, we 'll just say Ben addressed them.  Oh! So you invited Rachel then? <+++++> Sure. Why not?
Really? <+++++> Yeah?
I don 't think I'd be comfortable with any of my old lovers there. <+++++> Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn 't invite her?
Oh, no-no, y 'know I absolutely adore Rachel it's just that, well it might be a awkward for you. But it's absolutely your decision.  More tea? <+++++> Yeah sure.
Earl Grey? <+++++> Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.
Hi, sure! <+++++> Hi.
I knew. <+++++> You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
I did. <+++++> Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here -but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
Yeah, maybe... <+++++> Okay... okay, maybe I will...
Really? <+++++> I do.
Okay. <+++++> Okay. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Yes! Did you see that? <+++++> You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
I could not have done this without you. <+++++> Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer?  I'm fine, I'm fine.
What? <+++++> I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross. <+++++> Fine.
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship. <+++++> Good.
Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I 'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that... <+++++> No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I 'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore.
Well neither do I! <+++++> Is this about Mark?
Oh my God. <+++++> Okay, it 's not, it's not.
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you 're, you're, you're making this too hard. <+++++> Oh I 'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
I don 't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break. <+++++> Okay, okay, fine, you 're right. Let's ah, let's take a break,  let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something..
Do I know why we 're rushing? <+++++> Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?  Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!

Good luck, with your girlfriend. <+++++> Oh, thank you.  Hey, hey.  Rachel!!!!
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message. <+++++> Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.

Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let 's talk about it!! How was she? <+++++> She was...
Good different? <+++++> Nobody likes change.
Nobody likes change. <+++++> What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
 <+++++> WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
You seem to really like her. <+++++> Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y 'know no commitment.
Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica 's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks. <+++++> You think?
Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you 're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip. <+++++> Hey, you 're right.
Well, Ross and I were in grad school together. <+++++> But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
 <+++++> 
Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . . <+++++> You're over me?
Ohhhhhhhh God. <+++++> Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?
Ohh, ohh. <+++++> When, when were you... under me?
Really? <+++++> Really. It's always been you, Rach.
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK. <+++++> What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you! <+++++> You still love me?
Noo! Maybe! I, I don 't know. <+++++> What?!
Y'know I can 't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!! <+++++> FINE BY ME!!
Oh. <+++++> You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.
No, no, no. <+++++> OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.
Let's show 'em. <+++++> Okay dad.
I can't believe you did that. <+++++> Yeah, well.
Yeah, coffeehouse. <+++++> Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
Oh well, we don 't because we got the other pl-place. <+++++> How rude.
Hey! <+++++> Hi!
Ross! <+++++> Great to see you!
Good to see you too! <+++++> How you doing?
Good. Bye! <+++++> Okay! You take care!
Okay! You take care! <+++++> Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?
Yeah! That was so weird, huh? <+++++> Phoebe, why 'd you do it?
I didn 't do it! It was Chandler! He's He's mad at you! <+++++> What?! Why?!
Please, I think you know why. <+++++> I can 't think of anything.
Come on Ross, you 're a paleontologist, dig a little deeper. <+++++> Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn 't invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?
Do you think that 's something that he'd be mad at you for? <+++++> I guess it could.
Well then I think that 's it. <+++++> Well, if he 's angry, he really shouldn't just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.
No. <+++++> Remember? You-you were eating pizza.
Yeah. <+++++> Okay. Well, apparently Chandler 's angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
Oh, we 're supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us! <+++++> Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y 'know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
Here you go. <+++++> Oh.
Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go.  Y'know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just-I don't get Chandler. Y'know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don't get all upset. <+++++> All the time?
No! He blew us off! <+++++> What?!
I know! <+++++> I can 't believe it.  Can I tell you something? I'm a little mad at him now.
Can I tell you something? Me too. <+++++> Y 'know what? He didn't want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don't talk to him at all!
Ooooh! Freeze him out. <+++++> That 's right!
I like it! <+++++> Eh? We 'll show him!
I think we gotta end the freeze out. <+++++> Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?
Oh my God!! <+++++> So you two are really serious?!
Yep, pretty much. <+++++> You-you 're gonna get married?! I mean We're gonna be brothers-in- law!
Hi. <+++++> Hey-hey Pheebs!
What? <+++++> Chandler 's gonna ask Monica to marry him!
Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring. <+++++> You told her before you told us?
Hi! <+++++> Hey!
Hey! <+++++> Hello!
Welcome home. <+++++> So, how was the honeymoon?
You 're welcome buddy. <+++++> Yeah, thanks.
And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offered to help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you know out of nowhere Ross comes on to me. <+++++> Umm that 's that's a little misleading.
What is? <+++++> The lie you just told.
That-that you came on to me? <+++++> There 's the one!
But you did! I mean, let 's be honest. <+++++> Yes let 's. Y'know what? Uh, it's-it's not important. What is important is that, is that we're having a baby. And it's not-Doesn't matter who came on to who.
You know you kissed me first. <+++++> What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me signals all over the place!
I was sending you signals? <+++++> Yeah!
Oh please. Okay, anyone in this room think that I would send Ross begging symbols, please show of hands. <+++++> Y 'know what?! It doesn't matter! It doesn't matter what you believe! What matters is what happened!
Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me,  'cause maybe I need to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now? <+++++> Y 'know what? Y'know what? Rachel, just-just drop it.
No please, show me how I begged you! <+++++> I can show you, I have it on videotape!  It 's an expression.
Excuse me, I don 't want Greg and Jenny's rejects. <+++++> Rachel won 't talk to me! She won't even open the door!
Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert! <+++++> Okay, listen I am not a pervert!
That 's like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that! <+++++> Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, here 's what happened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and a half ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing.
Personal thing? What personal thing? I don 't know. <+++++> About about sex?  That I hadn't had sex in months?
Hey. <+++++> Do you have a minute? I 'd like to talk to you about something I'm, I'm really uncomfortable talking about.
Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom? <+++++> I actually had a topic in mind! I 'm, I'm kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.
Whoa, for like months? <+++++> Five to be lying, six.
Six months? Whoa that 's rough. <+++++> Well, I mean it 's not all bad. I'm learning to appreciate the uh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.
The sky 's blue Ross and I had sex yesterday! <+++++> Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well okay -I'm scared for my health!
Okay. Okay. Umm Ooh! Oh-oh, I got something. It's this story I came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; they're like putty. <+++++> Really? Well then tell it to me.
Okay. Now you 're gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story. <+++++> I 'll try to control myself.
Okay.  Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe <+++++> You were backpacking across Western Europe?
Have a nice six more months Ross! <+++++> Okay! Okay! Okay. I 'm sorry. Please, please, you were in Western Europe and?
I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded. And there were tall trees all around.  It was dead silent. Gorgeous.  And across the lake I saw a beautiful woman bathing herself but she was crying <+++++> Why?
Umm, this is great wine. <+++++> It 's from France In Europe Western Europe. Y'know umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe.
Really? <+++++> Uh-hmm -Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona.
I studied for a year in Barcelona. <+++++> Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking
I love hiking! <+++++> Oh that 's great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo
I think its Tibidabo. <+++++> Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?!
Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go? <+++++> Great! I 'm across the street having sex with her right now. Your story sucks!
Hey! Look, if it didn 't work it's because you didn't tell it right! Show me how you did it. <+++++> No! No, I don 't don't want to.
How long since you 've seen a girl naked? <+++++> I was backpacking across Western Europe.
I 'm not feeling it. <+++++> I was just outside Barcelona, hiking
No! No! No Ross! I 'm not hot! Are you hot? <+++++> It 's been six months! I'm always hot!
Well you 're not selling the story! It's like; it's like you don't believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when I'm preparing for an audition. Okay? I'll set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what you're doing wrong. <+++++> I 'll try that.
All right now All right, you 're all set up. You're good to go. Just hit record. All right? <+++++> Thanks.
Good luck. <+++++> Thanks. And-and hey Joe?
Yeah? <+++++> Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I 'll help you out.
That means a lot to me man. <+++++> Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay?  Rachel!
Oh Ross! <+++++> Hi!
Thank God you 're here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself? <+++++> That 's less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was.
That 's less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was. <+++++> So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera.
Yeah, definitely. <+++++> What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!
Y 'know what? This is not fair to her. Let's just forget the tape! <+++++> Thank you.  No!
You 're right. <+++++> Joey! No!
Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it?  Oh forget it!  Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village. <+++++> Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I didn 't even watch it! Anyway, here.  I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself.
No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it. <+++++> Forget it, she 's destroying it.
Okay fine! Fine! We 'll just have to think of some other way to put the whole 'Who came onto who,' thing to rest! Come on now, think!! <+++++> Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? It 's Rachel's tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.
I wanna see it. <+++++> What?!
Are we watchin ' the tape or not?! <+++++> I don 't want people to see it for your sake.
Ahh, I don 't believe you. I think you don't want them to see you begging me. <+++++> Rachel, please
Ah, a little preview! <+++++> Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high road, because in about five minutes I 'm gonna be saying
Okay, here we go. <+++++> Hello! Can I get you anything?
I screwed up so bad, I told Monica that I would stuff and send all these wedding invitations like weeks ago and I-I <+++++> You didn 't do it?
Did you do it on our invitations?! <+++++> Not on the ones we sent out.
Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems like yesterday they just got engaged. <+++++> I know. Hey remember remember the night they got engaged? How uh, you and I almost
Oh, I remember how we almost. Do you think we would 've gone through with it? Y'know, if we hadn't gotten caught. Do you think we would've done it? <+++++> I mean I I know I wanted to. I just, I just wasn't sure if you wanted to.
Oh I wanted to. <+++++> So we we both wanted to.
Interesting. <+++++> Yeah.  Anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best.
Okay, in about ten seconds you 're gonna see him kiss me. <+++++> And in about five seconds you 're gonna see why.
What?! <+++++> Now I 'm so happy.
So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story? <+++++> Yeah. Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesn 't matter. I mean, I think it would've happened either way. I mean if you hadn't initiated it I-I-I know I would've.
It was an amazing night. <+++++> It was. It was an amazing night.
You think it looked amazing? <+++++> I uh I don 't know. I mean I I honestly didn't watch it.
Yeah, me neither. Yet <+++++> Uhhhhhh that-that may be weird.
Yeah, it would be really weird. <+++++> Good luck.
Good luck to you. <+++++> Mind if I mute?
Oh please. <+++++> Oh, oh there go the clothes.
You are undressing very quickly. <+++++> Six months Rachel, six months.

Have to make it stop!! <+++++> No!!!
Okay. <+++++> Bye.
Hey Ross! Doesn 't Ben go to the Smithfield Day School? <+++++> Yeah. Why?
Sting has a son that goes there too! <+++++> Yeah I know; he 's in Ben's class.
You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?! <+++++> Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils?
Sting 's son, seven years old and there's a picture. <+++++> What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?
No, it 's New York magazine. It 's an article about the best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting? <+++++> Uh, I actually haven 't even met him.
Uh-huh, yeah that 's too bad. I really want to go to his concert Friday night, but it's totally sold out. I know! Why don't you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two I'll take you. <+++++> Well actually, I 'm picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he'll be there.
I can 't do that either! The soles' are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood. <+++++> Hey!
Hey! <+++++> Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school
I don 't think you did a very thorough job! <+++++> I dropped him off at Carol 's.  Anyway, it turns out that I'm not going to be able to get those tickets though.
Oh no! Why not? <+++++> Well it turns out that Ben and Sting 's son do not get along.
How come?! <+++++> Apparently, Sting 's son made fun of the fact that Ben's moms are lesbinims.
Wait! But Ross if they don 't get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends. <+++++> Phoebe, you can 't force kids to be friends.
Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen! <+++++> Playpen?! Ben 's seven!
Your kid is seven?!   He's really small.  Please! Please get the tickets! <+++++> Look I 'm sorry Pheebs, I can't do it.
Yes you can! Sting says so himself! <+++++> What?
Rosssss can! <+++++> Look Phoebe, I 'm sorry it's just
Rossss can! <+++++> Phoebe, I
Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?! <+++++> Well let's just say  Rosss caaaaan!
Oo, where are the seats? <+++++> Uh, middle balcony.
Okay, now would you say that that 's more than 50 yards away from Sting, his wife, or a member of his family? <+++++> Yeah.
Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go! <+++++> Oh, that's right!  Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?
Mmh-mmh. <+++++> Can you say Barbados?
Barbados! <+++++> Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right!  This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.
I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures. <+++++> Oh, right, because he's a scientist!
No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die. <+++++> Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.
All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally. <+++++> It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!
Wow! This place is beautiful! <+++++> Look at all these paleontologists!!
I've been following your career for years, I-I can't wait for your keynote speech. <+++++> Wow! This is very flattering, uh...
I would love your autograph. <+++++> Uh, uh... Sure! Uhm...  "Dear..."
Sarah. <+++++> "... Sarah. I dig you ", Uh? "Doctor Ross Geller".
Thank you so much! <+++++> Yeah, oh and Sarah... I'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, Professor Wheeler, a-and this is Joey Tribbiani.
No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called  "The Days of Our Lives". <+++++> Dude, it's just  "Days of Our Lives"... there's no the.
You really should have been more clear about that! <+++++> Hey!
Hey! <+++++> You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!
Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!? <+++++> Yeah, she never misses these conferences!  No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!
Oh my God! Did you talk to him? <+++++> Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?
You could say <+++++> Ready to go?
Oh I can't... I have seminars all day and I promised Ross I would look at his speech. <+++++> Yeah.
Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal! <+++++> I'm good, I have dinner plans .
Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming... <+++++> Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?
It's great. You're gonna be the hit of the conference. <+++++> Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. .
Hey guys! <+++++> The chocolates aren't here yet.
Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...? <+++++> If you want to check your email, just ask!
Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone! <+++++> Wha... what do you mean?
It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive. <+++++> What, oh my God. What did you do?
Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it. <+++++> Why, why would you open it?
Well, it didn't say  "This is a virus"!! <+++++> What did it say?
Nude... ... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry. <+++++> What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler!
It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right? <+++++> NO! I don't!!
It's really gone? <+++++> Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
I just feel awful. <+++++> Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!
Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but...  you know, you and Monica have the same  "I'm gonna kill you" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her... <+++++> Get out!
You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work. <+++++> Well, what do you do?
Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer. <+++++> I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?
I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions. <+++++> I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now, Joe!
Ross, we can solve this. I just heard your speech. We can recreate it! We've got all night! <+++++> Wha... what you really think we can do that?
Ugh. <+++++> Alright, ok, let's do it.  Uhm, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello!  And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic.
And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century. <+++++> Yeah, that's it?
Yeah. <+++++> Oh my God, we did it!
Actually I did it Ross. You remembered shockingly little of your own speech. <+++++> Yes, but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products. This is amazing, thank you, thank you so much.  That's a pretty necklace.
Thank you. <+++++> Hey, what do you say we celebrate? Champagne?
Oh yeah! Hey, save the cork and then we can fill the bottle with water and put it back so they don't charge you. <+++++> Oh my God, I love you.
Oh, this is such a cute picture of Emma. And is this your son... or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation? <+++++> That's Ben, my son from my first marriage.
Your first marriage? <+++++> Yeah.
You're married more than once? <+++++> No.
So, why did you break up? <+++++> Oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? She... she was... eh... gay.
Oh my God, this is so cool! <+++++> Ok, odd thing to get excited about!
No, it's just... I was enganged to a guy who turned out to be gay! <+++++> Hey! High-five!
Didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs? My fianc e was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner. <+++++> My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. She didn't get any fitter.
Right and then everybody finds out and they're like <+++++> I know! It's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? I mean, call, or leave a note
I know! <+++++> And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?
I didn't do that. <+++++> Me neither.
Yeah. <+++++> Hey!
Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech? <+++++> Yep, we got it, we got it.  Thank you so much.
Bye. <+++++> Good night.
Night. <+++++> Ok, good night!
Damn it! <+++++> Walls are pretty thin, guys!
Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous! <+++++> Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered
Not to mention the cold sores. <+++++> And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.
Really? <+++++> But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster
No, he really said it. <+++++> ... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...
... in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.  Thank you! <+++++> Oh, thanks guys!
I thought... it was wonderful! <+++++> Oh!
Jarvis Oberblau, Cornell.  I mean, the ideas you put forth and, and from someone... so... young... and... . <+++++> Ok... now... now we're just holding hands!
It was really... great! <+++++> Oh, thank you so much!
Oh! <+++++> Ok!... All right, thanks! Thank you so much, you guys!  Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!
Oh... I'm back! <+++++> Ok!... Uh... excuse me? Yeah?
Yeah! <+++++> Hey!  Well...?
You were incredible! <+++++> Yeah?
You blew them away! <+++++> Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean... uh, did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me?
I was not! <+++++> No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!
Oh my God!  I'm your groupie! <+++++> I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room! <+++++> Look, I took it too far!
I'm just saying, I have a cabin in the Adirondacks if you ever want to get away from the city, well, that'd be  just nifty! <+++++> Ooh, well. Ah, I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man.
Oh, you're back...  this is my wife, Nancy. <+++++> Get Out!
Ross, can I talk to you for a minute? <+++++> Yes, please!  So, what's going on?
Uh, well... Joey and I broke up. <+++++> Oh my God, wh-what happened?
Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus! <+++++> I knew that was him!
Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best. <+++++> Hey, you ok?
Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker. <+++++> Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here.
Or we could throw you both in now! <+++++> Ok, gentlemen! Please! Aren't we a little old for this? I mean, we're scientists, right? We're academics. And most importantly I... you- you will have to catch us first. . GO, GO, GO!
Thanks! <+++++> Hi.
Are they still looking for us? <+++++> Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores.  You know, we as a group are not the coolest.
Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores.  You know, we as a group are not the coolest. <+++++> I don't think they saw us.
Hum, so, I started to say you something earlier, hum...  There was another reason I realized it was time to end it with Joey. I kind of realized I... was starting to have feelings... for someone else. <+++++> Oh. Can I... can I ask who?
I think you know. <+++++> I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so...
I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so... <+++++> I'm sorry... we... we can't.
All right, all right. <+++++> I mean, you just went out with my best friend, and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea.  Or-or not!
Hey!  Hey! <+++++> Hi!
Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center. <+++++> Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?
Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now. <+++++> Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?
Okay. Okay, here 's a good one of us. <+++++> Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card y 'know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
Y 'know, every year I say I'm gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it. Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together? <+++++> Together? Like-like to people?
Yeah, y 'know. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. It'll be cute, okay? <+++++> Okay.
Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later? <+++++> Uh sure, sure.
Congratulations! You just got married! <+++++> I know. Can you believe that?
Wait, I 'm-I'm sorry. What's the big deal about a holiday card? <+++++> Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!
Hi! <+++++> Hey!
Hey, I went by the photo shop, take a look, here is a mockup of our card. What do you think? <+++++> Huh. Wow, this is great.
Now, do you think it should say,  "Love Ross and Mona?" <+++++> Well, we-we haven 't said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay to say it to other people.
How many did you want? I 'm getting a hundred. <+++++> A hundred?! Well, I-I guess I 'll take a-Mona, uh I-I'm not sure about the whole uh, card thing.
Really? Why not? <+++++> Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don 't know if we're really quite there yet.
Oh y 'know, I didn't think of it that way. You're right. You're right. So, can I ask you a question? <+++++> Yeah.
Where are we? <+++++> Huh.
Y 'know, like where are we? Where is this relationship going? <+++++> Hmm
I mean I love spending time with you, y 'know I just-I hope we're moving forward. I mean, we should probably talk about that. Don't you think? <+++++> Let 's do the card!
What? <+++++> The card! I think we 're there!
Okay. I -But I think we should still have this conversation. <+++++> Really?! I mean, even with the card?
Okay, even this is turning me on! <+++++> Hey!
Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how 's it, how's it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together? <+++++> Oh yeah, yeah we 're moving forward. You'll be getting our card!
You and Mona are doing a holiday card together? <+++++> Yeah, we 're not just doing a card! Y'know, she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going.
Ugh! Women! <+++++> I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman,  "So, where is this going?"
Uh Ross? You asked me that. <+++++> Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I 'm not a mind reader! Besides, I hate those conversations. I'm horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a gesture. Y'know, something that says we're moving forward without having to talk about it.
Like asking her to move in with you? <+++++> Smaller than that.
Making her a mixed tape? <+++++> Uh, bigger than that.
Give her a key to your apartment. <+++++> Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.
All right. Have you said,  "I love you?" You could say, I love you. <+++++> Yeah I-I don 't-I don't think I'm quite there yet, but I could say I looove spending time with you.
That is a slap in the face. <+++++> Forget it. I-I -Y'know what? I'll just have the conversation. I'll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best. What do you think Rach?
Yeah, I-I think I suggested that. <+++++> Aw, we-we are so  So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y'know hanging out with you. And I mean-I'm having a lot of fun.
Okay. <+++++> I mean, there 's no point in spending time with someone if-if it's just fun. It's gotta be, it's gotta be going somewhere right? So where-where is it going?  Ah! That's-that's the real question. And-and the answer is is it's going somewhere fun. Now I-I know what you're thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y'know, but you're-you're not getting any younger. No I mean-No not you, not you, you-you are getting younger. I mean -you-you look like you're getting younger by the second-What's your secret?
I 'm sorry, so umm, so where are we? <+++++> Well, well to sum up, we 're having fun, you look young.
Okay <+++++> But that 's not enough. So So here's a key to my apartment.
Really?! <+++++> Really.
You gave her a key to your apartment?! <+++++> Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship.
Hey. Ooh Ross! How 'd the conversation go? <+++++> Oh great, I live on the street.
Hey Ross, what 's going on? You changing the lock? <+++++> No. That guy is.
Umm, I-I thought we were moving forward and now you 're-you're sending me all these mixed signals. What are you trying to tell me? <+++++> I 'm trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.
What? <+++++> I love you!
What 's funny about that? <+++++> Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
Hey that 's okay. So, where do you want to go? <+++++> Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go.
The Hard Rock CafÃÂ©? <+++++> Yeah!
Again?! <+++++> Yeah!!
Yeah!! <+++++> I 'm telling you, I like the food!
Hey Toby! Have a good night. <+++++> Did that guy just call you Toby?
Yeah, he thinks that 's my name. <+++++> Well, why don 't you correct him?
Oh it 's been going on way to long now. Y'know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn't say anything. And then the next time he said, "Hey Toby, do you want a donut?" And I-I wanted a donut. And now it's five years later, the donut's gone and I'm still Toby. <+++++> Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!
No! That would be so awkward! Look -Besides, we work in different departments. He's on the sixth floor y'know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. What's the big deal? It could be worse, it's not like he's calling me Muriel. <+++++> Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel?  Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? It 's not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!!
Shh! It is a family name! <+++++> Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?
Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I 'm not drinking on this date tonight. "Umm, I'm a recovering alcoholic. I'm a Mormon," or "I got so hammered last night I'm still a little drunk?" <+++++> Hey!
Hey! <+++++> So, what do you want to do tonight? There 's a Ukrainian film at the Angelica that's supposed to be very powerful. Interested?
No. No. But I 'll go see a normal person movie with ya. <+++++> Rach? You wanna come?
Oh no, I can 't. I got a date. <+++++> A date?
Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you? <+++++> Why no, it 's the opposite of weird. It's-it's uh, regular. It's-it's uh, it's mundane. It's actually uh, a little dull.
Yeah -Ooh! Earrings! <+++++> A date?! She 's-she's got a date?! With who?
I set her up with this actor on my show. <+++++> You set her up?!
No <+++++> Joey what-what were you thinking?!
Well, I was thinking that it 'd probably be okay because Ross hasn't gone out with Rachel in five years! <+++++> Joey, I 'm not worried about her! I'm worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this  actor taking them?
Hey! I 'm an  actor too! I'm not sure. I think they're taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island. <+++++> A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!
Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour? <+++++> Why don 't they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that's a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That's fun too! Whew!!
Hey. <+++++> Hi. I-I hear you 're going on a ferry tonight.
Yeah. <+++++> A bit of a daredevil are we?
Yeah! All right, I 'll see you guys later. <+++++> Okay. Have a great time you guys.
Thank you. <+++++> Yes it is too slutty!
So what movie do you want to see -And not another one I have to read. Okay? I get enough of that from books. <+++++> Books?
All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it 's like enough! <+++++> Well, I tell you what. Why don 't we uh, why don't we just stay here? Let's not see a movie, we'll just hang.
And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date? <+++++> Hey, if that 's what you want to do I'm not gonna say no.
Dude! What is going on?! <+++++> I just I have to find out how it went.
Why? <+++++> This guy could be my baby 's stepfather!
They go on one date and you 're worried about them getting married?! He's not you! <+++++> I just -I-I can't believe she's-she's dating?!
Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do? <+++++> I don 't know! I guess I just can't believe any of this is happening.
What do you mean? <+++++> It 's just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan 's, it's like-It breaks my heart a little. I mean I've always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y'know? Maybe fight over the science section.
That 's a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that! <+++++> No! No I can 't. I mean Rachel's out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.
Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel? <+++++> It used to be. Now she doesn 't really have a face. Smokin' body though.
Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn 't Rachel. <+++++> No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?
I know, but I don 't think that's what she wants. <+++++> No, it 's not what I want either. I mean I-I can't force myself to fall in love with her again now.
That 's okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It's not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there's gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like? <+++++> Yeah.
Hey, I tell you what. Let 's you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on! <+++++> We can still catch that Ukrainian film.
Hi! <+++++> Well, how was the date?
Well I 'm alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy bars, what do you think? <+++++> Uh-huh. What happened?
I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant. <+++++> Ah, he didn 't uh, take it so well?
Well better than you, but y 'know still not what you want. <+++++> Oh?
He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh,  "Yeah, I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch." <+++++> He sounds swell.
Doesn 't he? <+++++> Hey, wanna wanna a little cheering up?
Yes. <+++++> Sit down.
Okay. <+++++> Guess whose middle name is Muriel.
Chandler M. Bing? <+++++> Yeah-ha!
Oh my God. <+++++> I 'm sorry about your date.
Oh it 's all right. I'm guess I'm just done with the whole dating thing. It's one more thing in my life that's suddenly completely different. This is hard. <+++++> Yeah I know.  On the other hand in um, in about seven months you 're gonna have something that you're gonna love more than any guy you've ever gone out with. Just wait. Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger. You have no idea.
Thanks sweetie. <+++++> You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?
Oh no, I think I 'm gonna go home and eat ten candy bars. <+++++> Hey, I thought I cheered you up.
Oh you did, there are twenty in here. <+++++> Right. Good night.
Ross? <+++++> Yeah?
Hey it 's Mona! From the wedding. <+++++> Oh hi!
Hi! <+++++> Wow! Uh how are you?
I 'm good except umm, you still owe me a dance. <+++++> Oh that 's right. Well uh, would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?
Oh you 're serious. Sure! <+++++> Great! Well umm
I think I might need one more cup of coffee. <+++++> Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya.
Oh man! <+++++> Hey!
Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend! <+++++> Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
Oh that 's great! <+++++> Yeah.
I mean think about all the money that you 're gonna make! <+++++> Why? What?
Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right? <+++++> No, no, that 's funny. But maybe it's time to move on, let it go, y'know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth's father, so ah, he's much older than she is. Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils, huh?
I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils. <+++++> Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings  in his ear.
Ross. <+++++> Oh, come on you guys; that 's funny! Y'know? Because he's need-he's got like a hearing aide y'know, 'cause-'cause y'know, 'cause he's all old, and
Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I 've decided to accept the fact that you're going out with her. <+++++> Really? That okay, that 's great.
Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I 'm funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now I'm telling you, I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore. <+++++> All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.
Yes it does. <+++++> But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don 't think there's really anything you can do about it.
I 'll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired. <+++++> Ohh! A man with a plan!
Yeah, I 've been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my Grandma's. <+++++> Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes -Do-do you want to make out?
Are you okay? What 's wrong? <+++++> Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father.
Well, whatever works for ya <+++++> No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.
Oh. Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person. Big deal. Besides, it 's kinda fun hiding. <+++++> Yeah.
Hey umm, you brought protection right? <+++++> Why?! Are there like bears or something?!  Ohh. Oh, protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot.
I 'll just run to the store and get some. <+++++> Oh no! Hey-hey, I 'm the guy! I'll get it.
Do you know where the store is? <+++++> No.
Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle? <+++++> A little bit.
I 'll be back in ten minutes. <+++++> Okay.
Why don 't you get in the hot tub and I'll meet you there. <+++++> Ohh, okay.
Okay.  What?! What are you doing here?! <+++++> What are you doing here?!
I came with Paul! <+++++> Yeah, I recognize the ankles!
I 'll be right back. <+++++> You and your ice.
Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on!  No! Not in there! He 's in there! <+++++> Did you really hear a bear?
Ross? Ross? <+++++> Elizabeth!  Okay. Okay.  I 'm gonna go out this window.  I'll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you're going home, okay?
Oh my God Ross! What in heaven 's name are you doing here? <+++++> And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I 'll have you fired. What you heard was, "Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!" <+++++> Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain
No, let me explain! Fired!! <+++++> All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy.
What? <+++++> And I too am just a love machine.
I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it. <+++++> Hey guys!
Have you guys picked a date yet? <+++++> Oh no, not yet.
I still cannot believe you 're engaged!  Just 'cause its happening so fast; not 'cause you're such a loser. <+++++> Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?
Ugh, she 's upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! I 'm not doing them this time! I don't care if those dishes sit in the sink until they're all covered with-I'll do them when I get home! <+++++> Yeah -oh! Hey listen umm, Emily found this wedding dress in London
Already?! <+++++> Yeah, but it didn 't fit. Well, luckily there's a store here that has one left in her size, but I'm the groom, I'm not supposed to see the dress
I 'll pick it up for you! <+++++> Thank you.
Oh, she 's got you running errands, y'know, picking up wedding dresses  Wah-pah! <+++++> What 's wah-pah?
Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes! <+++++> Hey!
Oh! It 's you.  Hi. <+++++> Hey, do uh, do you have a minute?
Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so <+++++> So listen uh, I know you and I haven 't really had a chance to talk since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were.
Oh. <+++++> I know if you were getting married I 'd feel, kinda .. y'know.
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but I 'm okay. <+++++> Yeah?
Yeah. <+++++> All right, I just wanted to check.
Oh, that 's sweet. <+++++> You 're great. And I-I know someday this will happen for you too. You just hang in there.
Uhh, hang in there? <+++++> Oh, no, I didn 't mean, uh
I mean maybe you didn 't hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua? <+++++> Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn 't realise that had become anything, yet.
Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has -yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates. <+++++> Oh. Yeah?
Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean y 'know, emotionally, mentally, physically <+++++> Wow, that 's-that's-that's incredible.
I know isn 't it? It's like I'm right there with Joshua. <+++++> Uh-huh.
You are right there with Emily. And it 's y'know, it's kinda like . it's a tie! Well, I gotta get, I gotta get back to the dishes. <+++++> I gotta get to work.
Oh yeah? Fine. <+++++> Hey, y 'know, y'know what would make me really happy?
Oh yeah, no, what 's that? <+++++> If like the four of us could all y 'know, hang out together. Uh, in fact Emily's coming into town this weekend, why don't you say we all have dinner? Say, Sunday night?
That would be great! <+++++> Yeah, all right, it 's a date.
Hang in there. You hang in there. <+++++> Did you say something?
Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like this <+++++> Hey man.
Hey! <+++++> So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?
I am  free! <+++++> Great! Because Emily and I are getting married in a month!
What?! <+++++> Yep!
In a month? <+++++> Yeah!
You mean, you mean 30 days? <+++++> Yeah.
From now? <+++++> Yeah.
Well, that 's great. <+++++> Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it 's going to be torn down, so I mean, I-I know it's crazy, but everything up 'til now has been so crazy, and I don't know, this just feels right. Y'know?
Again. Y 'know what? I think we all did. <+++++> Hey!
Hey! <+++++> So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about, Ernie 's at 9 o'clock?
Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three. <+++++> Oh, see I-I don 't know if we're gonna be hungry at three.
Three people. Joshua 's not gonna be there. <+++++> What happened?
Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me. <+++++> Noo. Why?
Well, apparently he scares easy. <+++++> Oh, Rachel, I 'm-I'm sorry.
It 's okay. Sometimes, things don't work out the way you'd thought they would. <+++++> Come here.
Oh, hey, don 't you have to go pick up Emily? <+++++> Yeah.
Yeah. <+++++> You okay?
Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh? <+++++> Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there 's the added mystery of who gets who. <+++++> Who gets whom.  I don 't know why I do that.
This is so cool,  'til Monica gets back, it's like I'm head chef and I get to make all the decisions. <+++++> Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!
All right I I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question. <+++++> So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I 'm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
Oh y 'know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you. <+++++> Really?! Wow! That 's-that's so nice, what are you gonna get me?
I don 't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office. <+++++> Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
Oh no-no-no, you don 't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets. <+++++> Oh, that 's not true! I've got her lots of stuff she never took back.
Like? <+++++> Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.
When was the last time you saw her wear it? <+++++> Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh
Hey! <+++++> What are you doing?
I 'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt. <+++++> Everything? Even the TV?
No! I 'm putting that in my room. <+++++> Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don 't you think you could at least hear the guy out?
Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out? <+++++> That 's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
Five years. <+++++> You 've sentenced him?!
Hey! Don 't do the crime if you can't do the time. <+++++> Joey, the guy 's your best friend.
No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don 't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open. <+++++> Oh, who? Me?
Yeah! <+++++> Wow! I 'm honored! And y'know what I'm gonna do as my first act as your best friend?
What? <+++++> I 'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
Yeah, I can see where I 'd be your best shot but, no. I'm sorry, but I think it's twisted. <+++++> Yeah.
He 's fine! <+++++> Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard 's son, you'd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.
The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts! <+++++> Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?
Why? <+++++> I just wanna check something.
Okay. <+++++> Now, we 'll see.
Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time. <+++++> The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.
Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed. <+++++> Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!
Well isn 't it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of? <+++++> What did you get?
My brother, Ross. <+++++> Hey.
Ooh, I like those sunglasses. <+++++> Like  'em, like 'em? Or, I'd like to get store credit for that amount like 'em?
Ross, can you pass me the yams? <+++++> Sure! Oh, and Joey 's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
Oh-ho-ho, we 've got company. <+++++> There 's nothing the matter with me. See, I'm not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.
Don 't say that I have no sentiment!  This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed!  This is from the museum from the first time we were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter! <+++++> I don 't know what to say, I'm sorry. Though, you're not supposed to take these.  It's like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
Oh, she sees him! Oh, they 're hugging! <+++++> He 's taking her purse!
I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don 't think your son will think it's yours and be horribly traumatised? <+++++> Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
Ohh, it 's time to go. <+++++> Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock 's a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
Well that 's ambitious. <+++++> Hey, uh, you can ignore that.
That 's Carol with your son! <+++++> Uhh, believe me when he 's older, he'll understand.
Ross! <+++++> I 'll be right there.   Hello!  Hello!  Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan.
Ahh! <+++++> Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so
Oh, he 's fine. He's fine. It's just that us getting along is difficult for him, because he doesn't like me. <+++++> Oh come on! That 's-that's true.
Hey! <+++++> So uh, Emily called last night
And now you 're giving me the message! <+++++> Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they 're going to the theatre together! They're going to dinner! They're going horseback riding!
God, Susan is so fun! <+++++> Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was
You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan? <+++++> Hey, they 're going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y'know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful-didn't you see Personal Best?
Hi! Hi! You 're crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight. <+++++> How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!
Yeah, I definitely. I don 't like the name Ross. <+++++> What a weird way to kick me when I 'm down.
No! No! I-I meant for the baby! <+++++> Oh. What 's wrong with Ross?
Well, it 's just y'know that something like this would never to like The Hulk, y'know <+++++> Actually that-that 's not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found  Y 'know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend's a lesbian.
Hey! How 's Ben? <+++++> Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said,  "No." I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, "No." I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, "No." So, he's sweeping.
Hey, Ben! Hey! <+++++> So umm, any word from Susan?
Ooh, yeah! She said she 's having sooo much fun with Emily. <+++++> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don 't know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
What 's too much fun? <+++++> Y 'know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.
Oh my God, you are so paranoid! <+++++> Am I?!
Yes! <+++++> Am I?!
I can 't speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship. <+++++> Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y 'know? Say-say they're coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they're laughing, y'know, someone innocently touches someone else There's electricity, it's new. It's exciting. Are you telling me there isn't even the slightest possibility of something happening?
Maybe. <+++++> OH MY GOD!! I didn 't really believe it until you just said it!!
No, it 's all right. I got nice boobs. <+++++> So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!
So? <+++++> So! Poetry? Susan 's gay! They're being gay together!
Emily 's straight. <+++++> Oh, wake up!
Wow, Carol really messed you up! <+++++> Excuse me?
Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant.  All right, so I don 't know what sycophant means, but the rest is right. <+++++> Look, I don 't know what you're talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person.
Huh. <+++++> What?
This totally makes sense! <+++++> It does not!
This is so much fun! <+++++> This is not fun!
Yeah. The  '92 Ross wouldn't. <+++++> Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.
Hey! <+++++> Hi!
Hey! I missed you. <+++++> Oh, I missed you too.
Oh, so did I. <+++++> No tongue.
Okay. <+++++> Okay, I know I 'm not supposed to know, but I do. And I'm so excited for you!
What? What 's going on? <+++++> Monica 's pregnant!
Ah.  Slow swimmers? <+++++> What?! What do you mean? You-you-you 're not pregnant?
You didn 't tell anybody I was did you?! <+++++> No!  I 'll be right back.
Oh hi, I 'm, I'm Mona from her restaurant. <+++++> Oh! Hello uh, Mona from her restaurant.   Mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name.
You think so? I 've always kinda hated it. <+++++> Aw come on, Mona Lisa?
Uh-huh. <+++++> Mona umm Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no she's uh-well she's dead now. No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world.
Really?! Well see? I never knew about her. <+++++> Linda Clickclocken.  So what uh, what-what table are you at?  Oh, uh me too.
Oh good. Now there 'll be someone there who likes my name. <+++++> Yes there will.  Oh guess what, Molly Gilbert you 've just been bumped up to table one. And if it's all right with you I'm gonna take your place at table six-Martin Clickclocken.
Thank you, thank you very much. If everyone will please take your seats, dinner will be served. <+++++> Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six.
No, nine. <+++++> Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way  which uh, which was misleading. Well I 'm  Hello.

Sure. <+++++> Yeah?
Yeah. <+++++> Oh great!

Dr. Geller, will you dance with me? <+++++> Oh umm, well uh, maybe-maybe later. Right now, I 'm about to dance with this lady.
Ohhhh! <+++++> Uh, unless! Unless, uh this lady wouldn 't mind letting you go first.
I 'd be happy to.  You are very sweet. <+++++> Yes I-I am. In fact umm hey, why don 't we try it my special way? You can dance on my feet.
Sure! <+++++> Yeah? Hop on.  Is the pretty lady looking?
Uh-huh. <+++++> Keep dancing.
Thank you. <+++++> No-no, thank you Miranda.

Can I go next? <+++++> What? Of course you can! Hop on!
Okay, but I get to hop on after her. <+++++> I am so gonna score.

Dancing on your feet! Like the other girls did it. <+++++> Okay.  Hop on Gert.
Why aren 't you moving your feet? <+++++> I 'm trying.
Faster! You 're not going fast enough! <+++++> Maybe I should stand on your feet!
Shh. Shh. Don 't try to talk, we'll get you up to your room, we'll soak your feet, you'll be okay. <+++++> Oh, thank you.
Yeah. <+++++> Wait a minute! No! I 'm the nice one! I'm the one who danced with the kids all night! How How small are your feet?!
So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together? <+++++> Oh, I'm actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah, she's been away all week visiting her parents, but she'll be cool. I mean, she's been so supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, 'Fossils are my friends.'
Ugh. Come on, Mona, don't kiss ass. <+++++> Uh, I'm going to take off.
All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape! <+++++> What is it?
It's a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back to your apartment? <+++++> All right.  'Candy and Cookie?'
Oh, Monica, grow up! <+++++> Hey, what's behind your back?
Nothing. Just something I want to get Phoebe's opinion on for Valentine's Day. <+++++> You don't want my opinion?
Not really. <+++++> Come on, I'm your older brother, ask me!
All right, big brother.  Which of these do you think would make your little sister look hotter, so your best friend would want to do her? <+++++> The red one.
Hi! <+++++> Hey!  So, how was Atlantic City?
Good. <+++++> Yeah?
I brought you back a present. <+++++> Wha-? Oh, come on. You didn't have to-saltwater taffy?!  Thanks! This is interesting. You know, most people think this is made with sea water, but it's actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. That's not interesting.
I think it's interesting. <+++++> I do too! I missed you!
I missed you, too! So, how was your week? <+++++> Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!
How exciting! <+++++> Yeah! I know! It was. Oh the only sad thing is I wasn't around when it happened for the first time.
Oh no. <+++++> Yeah, I'm missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.
Yeah right! <+++++> What?
Joey cracks me up! It's like, 'Yeah, why don't you have your ex-wife move in with you? That wouldn't be awkward at all!' <+++++> Huh uh-huh.
So, what'd you tell him? <+++++> Just a second!
How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you? <+++++> I don't know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy!
Taffy, really? I've never had any. <+++++> Ever?!
Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats.  Thank you! So what, you're just never going to tell her? <+++++> Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know, I'm going to take her to an amazing Valentine's dinner. Do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks I'm the best boyfriend in the world, then I'm going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.
Oh, I've got big Valentine's plans! I've got my Chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy! <+++++> Y'know, it's interesting! Most people think that's made with seawater, when in fact-
Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash! <+++++> Mona? What are-hi! What are you doing here? I'm, um, supposed to pick you up!
Change of plans, I made you a special Valentine's dinner! Surprise! <+++++> Ayyyayyyy!
Hi! Hi. Hi, Rachel!  What's she doing here? <+++++> I have no idea!
Seriously, what is she doing? <+++++> Uh lately, she just likes hanging out here.
Why? <+++++> I think she's lonely.
Okay, but it's Valentine's Day! <+++++> I know.
Can't we just ask her to go? <+++++> No, no. She's way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy.
Oh, my God! She has food delivered here? <+++++> Mm-hmm. She's-she's emotional, but, but ballsy.
You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed! <+++++> And you thought she was going to be in our way! So, why don't you, uh, open the champagne, and I'll be right back. I've got a surprise for you.
You got another ex-wife back there? <+++++> Please start drinking!
But, but, Mona, I live here. <+++++> Happy Valentine's Day!  Or something to remember me by.
Hey, what's up? <+++++> Uh Mona just dumped me.
Oh, man, I'm sorry. Why? <+++++> Well, with everything that's been going on lately, I haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didn't tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?
Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentine's Day. <+++++> Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine's Day? What's going on, huh? Girl trouble?
Sort of. <+++++> Really?!
You don't have to seem so happy about it. <+++++> Oh, sorry. Well, look, maybe I can help you with it.
Oh, I I d- <+++++> Hey, whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me. Y'know, actually once-once I got dumped during sex.
Hey, whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me. Y'know, actually once-once I got dumped during sex. <+++++> Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?
Forget about it. It's no big deal. <+++++> C'mon! Joey! What is it?
It's nothing. <+++++> Hey, hey, it's me. Why can't you tell me?
Okay, uh sit down.  Um there's this woman that I like. A lot. But, uh it can't happen. <+++++> She's not a Tribbiani?
No! <+++++> I knew it. So, is she someone from work?
Yes. <+++++> Well, uh, does she like you?
Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesn't matter, because I can't do anything about it. <+++++> Why not?
Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we're really good friends. <+++++> So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh is he still in love with her?
No. I don't think so. <+++++> Okay. Um is he a good guy?
Yeah, he's the best. <+++++> Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
Oh, I don't know. <+++++> Joey, it's worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.
I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I- <+++++> Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.
Here's your warm milk. <+++++> I'm going to uh I'm going to, um, put the bourbon in it at home.
Oh, yeah. <+++++> Anyway seriously, uh just just talk to the guy, okay? And tell me how it goes.
So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon. <+++++> Ohhh.
What? <+++++> Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?
You wanna be in charge of the food committee? <+++++> Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?
Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun? <+++++> Yeah.
Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner. <+++++> Thanks for being born.
Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you. <+++++> Oh, now you can exchange them if you want, ok.
Wow you, you. I had no idea. <+++++> Really?
No, I knew. <+++++> All right.
Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall. <+++++> What?
I can't believe this is happening. <+++++> You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.
I do. <+++++> That's who.
Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while. <+++++> Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?
It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today. <+++++> I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.
I think I need a drink. <+++++> Oh, here, I, I'll get it for ya. Whad'ya want?
Scotch. <+++++> Scotch. Alright, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass.
Neat. <+++++> Cool.
No no no, no no no, neat, as in no rocks. <+++++> I know.
Oh hello Ross, where have you been? <+++++> Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.
Oh, scotch neat. Ya know, that's Rachel's father's drink. <+++++> Oh, mine too. Isn't that neat, scotch neat. Would you excuse me?
I'm getting my cigarettes out of my jacket. <+++++> No. no.
Whad'ya mean no? <+++++> No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir.
Get my glasses too. <+++++> All righty roo.
Ross, whose glasses are those? <+++++> Mine.
You wear bi-focals? <+++++> Um-hmm.
Well those are very popular frames. <+++++> Neil Sedaka wears them.
Yeah, like a chimney. <+++++> Ohh, big smoker.
Are you wearing my glasses? <+++++> Yes.
Thank you. Is that one of my cigarettes? <+++++> 
Ross, what're you doing. <+++++> I'm getting ready for the water skiing.
That'll teach you to lick my muffin. <+++++> 
Oh no, what happened? <+++++> Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox.
Oh no. <+++++> Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it.
Oh, stop that, stop that right now. <+++++> You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.
And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you. <+++++> Alright you kids, bye now.
I really can't say. <+++++> So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?
I'm sorry, but I can't say. <+++++> Wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines.
Ok, I'll walk you out. <+++++> Bye Ryan.
So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things? <+++++> You like that do ya?
Oh yeah. <+++++> I'll make some calls.
Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-... Hey sailor. <+++++> Is this what you had in mind?
Oh, here is your beautiful baby. Congratulations! <+++++> I hope you 're a better father than you're a friend!!
Hey Ross! The baby 's kicking! <+++++> What?! It is?!
It 's not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do  that again. <+++++> Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?
A dreamless sleep. <+++++> My God, the baby 's kicking. That's great. Although I kinda wish I-I would've been there to feel the kicking for the first time y'know.
Well I got stuff going on in here  if you wanna feel. <+++++> Look, I-I don 't want to miss anymore baby stuff. So Here. Here's my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! I'll be there! Okay? I don't care if it's three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.
Oh hey-hey! <+++++> Is everything okay?
Yeah, everything 's fine! <+++++> Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?
Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions. <+++++> Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women don 't even feel them.
Hey uh, what 's with the candy? <+++++> Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater.
Oh you went to the movies by yourself? <+++++> No I -Mona!
Oh, I gotta go back in there. <+++++> What? Why? What 's wrong?
No, everything 's fine. I just gotta go back <+++++> No really, you tell me what 's up.
I-I forgot my underwear. <+++++> So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.
Oh hey, don 't worry about it man. Don't worry about it, no big deal. <+++++> Yeah but still, I mean it should 've been me. I'm the dad.
Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick! <+++++> Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.
Ohh! That 's so sweet of you! Oh yum!  Did you put pickles on this? <+++++> Well yeah!
Oh Ross!! <+++++> What?! What?! Rach what?!
What 's going on? <+++++> I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.
Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad. <+++++> I-I 'm sorry Rach, I didn't know. Are you gonna be okay?
I 'm on it! <+++++> I can 't believe this! I shouldn't be the one making her throw up!
Dude relax! It could happen to anyone. <+++++> Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I don 't know any of it and I'm the father. I wish I'd be more involved y'know.
Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second? <+++++> Yeah.
But Joey, I don 't think Ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. I mean--Or he does. <+++++> No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.
But Ross, its you and me! <+++++> So? Sure! But it-it wouldn 't be anything romantic. And I'm-I'm dating Mona-Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! What is wrong with me?!
I don 't know. Is it crazy? <+++++> No! No it 's not. Joey, this is a smart idea.
Okay, let 's do it. I'll move in. <+++++> Really?
Yeah. <+++++> Oh Rach that 's great. That's great.
Oh, blimey, I still can 't believe you've got an earring! <+++++> Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe?
He does that?! <+++++> Uh, I don 't know, whatever.
I think it makes you look really dangerous. <+++++> Oh, I know. Y 'know what, I never would've gotten this if it weren't for you. No really, when I'm with you I'm-I'm like this whole other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love that guy!
I love both of you! <+++++> Yeah?
I wish I didn 't have to go. <+++++> Then don 't. Stay here. Just don't go so soon to London, just one more day.
Ohh, Ross, please! <+++++> One more day, seriously/
Don 't do this to me, again. You'd know I'd stay here in a minute, but I'd really miss so much work, they'll fire me. <+++++> So, then you can stay as long as you want.
I wish I could. <+++++> Oh no. Don 't, don't, don't start packing. Come on!
I don 't think you understand packing. Look, I just don't want to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here. <+++++> Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on.
You didn 't! <+++++> No. No, I didn 't. I didn't want to be that guy.
Oh come -look, when I was a kid my dad's company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn 't in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that! <+++++> Hey, guys!
We don 't make enough fun of you already? <+++++> Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.
You do know that Wham broke up? <+++++> I like it, and Emily likes it, and that 's what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?
Where is Emily? <+++++> Ugh, she 's saying good-bye to her uncle.
Man, didn 't she like just get here? <+++++> Yeah!! Yeah!
Easy tiger. <+++++> I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it 's-it's so great. But at the same time I'm thinking, "Well, I'm gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."
So what are you going to do? <+++++> Nothing! There 's nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she'd have to uh, move here. She should move here!
What? <+++++> I could ask her to live with me!
Are you serious? <+++++> I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!
Because you 've only known her for six weeks! Okay, I've got a carton of milk in my fridge I've had a longer relationship with! <+++++> Look guys, when I 'm with her it's-it's-it's like she brings this- this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y'know?
All right look, Ross, he 's right. Emily's great, she's great! But this way too soon, you're only gonna scare her! <+++++> I don 't want to do that.
No! You don 't want to wreck it, you don't want to go to fast! <+++++> Yeah, no, you 're right, I know, you're right, I'm not, I'm not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys.
I packed while you were gone. I left some knickers under your pillow. <+++++> Move in with me.
What?! <+++++> Don 't be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it's too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.
Ohh, no. Ugh. Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there. <+++++> I know.
My job! <+++++> Well, so, you-you 'll get a job here! I mean, I'm always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!
Yeah, but it-it-it 's my whole life-you come to England. <+++++> No, I can 't. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can't leave him. Isn't-you don't think there's any way?
Ohh, I don 't think so. I mean it would be different if it was way into the future -and-and-and we were getting married or something. <+++++> What?
Oh no, no, right I shouldn 't have said married. Uh, please don't go freaky on me. I didn't mean it. Well, I didn't say it; I take it back! <+++++> No, no, don 't. Why don't we?
Why don 't we what? <+++++> Get married.
You are mad! <+++++> No! No! I 'm not! It's-it's-it's perfect! I mean it's better than you just-just moving here, 'cause it's us together forever, and that's-that's what I want.
We 've only known each other for six weeks! <+++++> Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who 's-who's to say? Does that me we- we can't do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn't it?
My parents are going to be really mad. <+++++> Is that -are you saying yes? Is that yes?
Yes! <+++++> Yes! We 're getting married?!
Oh my God! <+++++> Yes!
We 're getting married! <+++++> Come here, come here. Uh,  ow! Emily, will you marry me?
Ohh, it 's a bit small. <+++++> Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
Okay, scarf 's done. <+++++> Come on! Come on. Come on.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Ross has some big thing to tell everyone. <+++++> Uhh, okay, it 's uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.
When, when did -how, how did you <+++++> We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.
I mean, we know it 's a bit hasty but, uh, it just feels so right, so <+++++> Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys
I can 't believe you're getting married! <+++++> Yeah.
Hey! <+++++> Hi! Hey!
Ooh! So close. <+++++> Hey everybody!
Hi! <+++++> Hey uh, this is Elizabeth.
Oh hi! <+++++> Hi!
Oh, we 're not together. <+++++> Oh no-no-no, we 're just two people who happen to run into each other here at the coffee house.
Well, I really wanted to meet you guys, but I have to run. I 'll see you later? <+++++> Okay!
Bye Ross. <+++++> Bye.
Oops! I did not mean to run into you like that sir. <+++++> Oh that is quite all right ma 'am.
So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do? <+++++> Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
Oh, tell her good luck with that. <+++++> Anyone else? Huh? Bring  'em on!
Oo! When 's her birthday?! <+++++> I don 't know Rachel, why?
Oh, I like Elizabeth. <+++++> Well thanks!
Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how 's it going with her? <+++++> Well, actually it 's been great. She's 20 so she's not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.
Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice. <+++++> Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are
Professor Geller? <+++++> Hmm?  Oh, a student I don 't know.
I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment? <+++++> Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?
Making out in your office. <+++++> Shh!  Of course, why don 't we go inside?
Shh!  Of course, why don 't we go inside? <+++++> Oh-ooh!
What? <+++++> Doorknob! Doorknob!
Oh! Sorry! Umm, I actually do need to talk to you. <+++++> Oh, okay. What-what about?
Spring vacation. <+++++> Spring vacation.
Professor Geller! <+++++> Yes, professor Feesen-sen- stenlger I 'll be with you in one moment.  So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints.
Just tell her the truth! Tell her you 're not ready. <+++++> I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
Or! You can just, y 'know <+++++> What the hell are you doing?
What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge! <+++++> What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!
You pushed him! <+++++> Joey, I did not break this! Okay?  That has been broken for a while.
I still haven 't gotten a check for your half yet. <+++++> Do not give him any money!
You wanted to see me Professor Geller? <+++++> Yes. Yes! Please, come in.
Yes. Yes! Please, come in. <+++++> Oo-oo!
Doorknob? <+++++> Yeah, it kinda grows on you.  Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.
Oh good. <+++++> Look, I  Look, I 'm having a great time with you and I just don't want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So, I'm sorry I just don't think we should go away together yet. It's-it's too soon.
Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that I 'm going to Florida for a couple weeks. <+++++> No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was
You are so adorable. <+++++> That! Let 's talk about that.
Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth? <+++++> Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn 't want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she's going to Florida for spring vacation.
Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break? <+++++> What 's-what's the difference?
Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you 're doing frat guys. <+++++> Hey, y 'know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.
What did you do on yours? <+++++> I went to Egypt with my dad.
I can see it now,  "Look dad, it's the Sphinx!" <+++++> Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than,  "Spring break!"  All right? I mean she's taken my class!
And slept with the professor. <+++++> I 'm gonna call her.
Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say? <+++++> Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl 's bodies, waking up next to people you don't even know
So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y 'know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks. <+++++> Okay, she can 't go.
Ross, you can 't tell her not to go. You just started dating. <+++++> Then what am I supposed to do?
Nothing, you just have to be cool with it. <+++++> Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
Yeah! I 've been working so hard this semester. I really need to go crazy y'know, blow off some steam. <+++++> Sure. Sure. Look I don 't, I don't know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.
What? <+++++> Are you into crafts at all?
Ross, are you okay? <+++++> Well, yeah, of-of course I 'm okay! What? I'm just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and  what-what is uh, what's this?
It 's a bathing suit? <+++++> To wear in front of people?
Is that supportive? <+++++> Is this?!
I will. <+++++> Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?
Yeah. <+++++> It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it 's revealing which I'm fine with, no I'm concerned about your health, sun exposure.
Oh, don 't worry I have plenty of sun block, it's SPF-30. <+++++> Well, if what 's in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it's-it's get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it's just milk.
Ross, it 's going to be okay. I'm not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us. <+++++> Really?
Yeah! I 'm just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends. <+++++> Okay. Cool.
Elizabeth! <+++++> Call me!
There's this woman, that I like.  A lot.  Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy.  For a long time.  And I could never do that to the guy, y'know?  'Ccause we're really good friends. <+++++> So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh is he a good guy?
Yeah, he's the best. <+++++> Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
Oh, I don't know. <+++++> Joey, it's worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.
I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I- <+++++> Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.
Yes. <+++++> Um, you you like Rachel?
Yes. I like Rachel. <+++++> Rachel?!
Yeah, okay but look, buy uh -Hey-hey, y'know, y'know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn't get said enough. I like you Ross. <+++++> But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?!
Yeah, but it 's not a big deal. <+++++> It 's not a big deal? Oh, I'm sorry I just um, I what about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I like-you-you can't stop thinking about her. Like how you can't sleep?
I 'm an actor, y'know? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic. <+++++> Rachel who 's carrying my baby? Rachel?
Look no, I-I know it 's bad, and I know it's wrong. Okay? But-but it's not like anything's ever gonna happen. Y'know? These-these are just feelings, they're gonna go away. <+++++> Y 'know what? I-I gotta go.
Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don 't <+++++> I just -y'know-I-I just have one-Rachel?!
Hey. <+++++> Hey.
I just talked to Joey, I just -I want to see how you were. <+++++> Oh y 'know, I still-I can't believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean it's It's like you and me going out, only weirder!
All right, I know you 're hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but don't say that again. <+++++> Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he 'd be the stepfather of my child.
Honey, I don 't think that's something we need to worry about! First of all he's-he's never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how she'd react. <+++++> Sure, because women never like Joey. Y 'know, I think he's a virgin.
Joey he's not even thinking about going after Rachel! <+++++> He 's not?
No! All he 's thinking about is how you're taking this! I mean, listen it's totally freaking him out. He's talking about moving to Vermont. <+++++> Why?
He says he wants to leave the country.  He thinks you hate him. <+++++> Hate him? I No, I don 't hate him.  It's just it's Rachel, y'know?
Honey I can 't even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I don't want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you're still his friend. <+++++> Okay. Okay, I 'll talk to him.
Hey. <+++++> Hey.
Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it. <+++++> No, I don 't want to hit you.
Oh what then? Kick me? <+++++> No.
Bite me? <+++++> No, no I don 't want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that I'm not mad at you and and that I certainly do not hate you. I just, I just came here to say that.
Oh now -Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something? <+++++> Uh yeah sure.
Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I don 't <+++++> Okay.
Hey look Ross, you need to understand something okay? I uh I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you. <+++++> Thank you.
Anyway, it uh look it'll just take me a while to get over her, that's all. I'm not even sure how to do that, I mean I've never been in love before so <+++++> What?! You 're in love with her.
Yeah, I thought you knew that. <+++++> Umm, no.
Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don 't want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking, "Ah, I'll get over this." Y'know? I just-It just keeps gettin' harder. I don't, I don't know what to do. Y'know? What do I do? <+++++> I think you need to tell her how you feel.
Okay that 's the green stuff talkin'. <+++++> No, I 'm serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if she's not where you are, then you can start to move past this.
But what if uh -and I'm not saying she will be-But <+++++> If she is where you are then uh then my feeling weird about it shouldn't stand in the way.
Are you sure? <+++++> Yeah. Look if-if she 's gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn't find a better guy. So
Hey thanks. <+++++> So when do you think you 're gonna talk to her?
Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven 't even thought about what I will say. What should I say? <+++++> I 'm understanding, but let's not get carried away.
I 'm sorry, you're right. What am I gonna say?  Oh! <+++++> Yeah, tell me about it.
Hey.  Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff? <+++++> Why not? It 's built into the price of the room.
Yeah but you don 't need--What is this? <+++++> Thread!
Score! Where are the disposable cameras? <+++++> What disposable cameras?
The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them? <+++++> No you didn 't.
Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said <+++++> Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said,  "Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?"  Yeah, then you did that.
So you don 't have the cameras?! <+++++> No. Sorry man.
So? What? What? They 're gone! Monica's gonna freak! <+++++> Well, I 'm sure they're still somewhere here in the hotel. I'll-I'll help you look for them.
Great. <+++++> In-in three minutes.
Hey! Did you find the cameras? <+++++> No. Did you?
Yes! And that 's why I'm under the table. Celebrating. <+++++> Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-one 's turned them.
Well this is great. Y 'know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, she's really depressed. <+++++> Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?
All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can 't believe I screwed this up! <+++++> I 'm sorry man.  Here's a thought. This is the same ballroom. There's a band. There's gonna be plenty of dressed up people.
Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away? <+++++> No-no-no, I 'm saying we-we buy more of this  at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else's faces.
Are you serious? <+++++> I 'm just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?
Marriage advice? Really?! <+++++> I 'm telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren't these the same flowers?
I don 't know, Monica picked out the flowers. <+++++> What about the chairs?
She picked those out too. <+++++> How about the place settings?
That was her. <+++++> What did you do?
I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop? <+++++> Hmm.
It didn 't click. <+++++> I heard it. I heard it.
Why don 't you go up on stage. I'll get a picture of you doing the speech. <+++++> Okay. Okay!
Okay. Okay! <+++++> Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre please see the front desk? Your car is about to be towed.
That 's my car! <+++++> A  '95 LeSabre?!
Yes! <+++++> A green LeSabre?
Yes! <+++++> I 'm sorry, I meant a blue LeSabre.
Yes! Green-blue! <+++++> Well go! Go move it!
Okay, you ready for the last picture? <+++++> Yeah.
It 's picture time. <+++++> Now you are going to love these.
Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags! <+++++> Huh, didn 't see that coming.
Okay! <+++++> Well, I 'm gonna go get these  in some water.
Wait you stole those from these people 's wedding? <+++++> No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby. Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming.  Hey! My sweater! I 've been looking for this for like a month!
Good! Good, long time no see. <+++++> Yeah.
Like your sweater. <+++++> Oh hey, right back at ya.
Oh, it 's crazy about Rachel huh? <+++++> Yeah. She -Well, she's one crazy lady?
So whose is it? <+++++> Umm, I don 't some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later.
Okay. <+++++> He is so weird.
Ok honey, you really need a job. <+++++> Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.
Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there. <+++++> On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.
No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so. <+++++> Freakish.
Man, I am so beat. <+++++> Oh yeah.
Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here? <+++++> Yeah alright.
What's with you? <+++++> Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.
No. <+++++> Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat.
Why should we? <+++++> Because it's a special hat.
You're kiddin'. <+++++> It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know.  We're grown ups, this kinda stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore.
Oohhh. <+++++> Hi.
Hey. <+++++> What?
Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets? <+++++> Do you say this stuff to girls?
And look where they're sitting. <+++++> You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.
You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here. <+++++> Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat.
There you go. <+++++> Thank you Gunther. We didn't want to have to go and do that.
You told on us? <+++++> Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice.
Don't play with his things. <+++++> I know.
Alright, let's take this outside. <+++++> Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that?
You had to ask. <+++++> Yeah.
Your cappucino sir. <+++++> Thank you.
Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house. <+++++> Absolutely.
Ok. <+++++> No.
No? <+++++> No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.
Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before? <+++++> Yeah, sure.
By someone besides Monica? <+++++> No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.
Ah, there we go. <+++++> I think we proved our point.
You burn your mouth? <+++++> Cannot feel my tounge.
Did we not make ourselves clear the other day. <+++++> Yes, and that's why we're here.
Let's do this alright. <+++++> Woah, ho-ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon?
Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon? <+++++> Whad'ya mean?
Of course we're hitting faces, why wouldn't you hit faces? <+++++> Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.
C'MON! <+++++> Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm standin here, huh.
Us, what about you guys? Man you really, bing, gave it to old Mr. Clean back there. He was a big guy. <+++++> Yeah he was wasn't he.
Don't do that to yourself. Any one of us could have tripped over that little girls jump-rope. <+++++> So, listen guys, are we uh, are we ok here?
We're ok. <+++++> Alright.
Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them. <+++++> So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?
Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle. <+++++> Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.
Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me? <+++++> How 'bout from now on we just call it the 'unfortunate incident'?
Yeah. <+++++> Here, go nuts.

Just some stuff for the party. <+++++> Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?
Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . . <+++++> C'mon Rachel.
OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair. <+++++> See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said.
Ross, the heat! <+++++> Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one.
Did you just break the radiator? <+++++> No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is.
Well put it back. <+++++> It uhh, it won't go back.
Here, let me try. <+++++> Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.
No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party. <+++++> Hey, here's a theme
Yeah, I'm with Mon. <+++++> Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day? Well, alright, even though he's your super, I'm seizing.
Oh wow, I didn't get you anything. Here's five back. <+++++> No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright. Oh, hey, do you think there's a chance you could fix that radiator now?
Ross. <+++++> Yeah.
What'cha gonna' do? <+++++> Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah. Will uh, will this help with the knob getting?
Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier. <+++++> Hey, Phoebs, how'd it go.
Honey, I'm sorry. <+++++> Are you OK?
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth. <+++++> You got me a cola drink?
And, a lemon lime. <+++++> Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.
Tongue? <+++++> Yeah.
Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night? <+++++> That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful
Wait a minute. I thought last night was great. <+++++> Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?
We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel. <+++++> Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and...
Good. How are you? <+++++> Good.
Hi, honey. <+++++> Hi, Julie.
Good. <+++++> 
Oh, well, actually. <+++++> 
What? <+++++> 
Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column. <+++++> Can't we just use a pen?
Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first. <+++++> I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.
You could say that. <+++++> And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.
Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else? <+++++> I don't know.
Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her? <+++++> 
Really? <+++++> Really. It's always been you, Rach.
Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good. <+++++> I know, I know, it's, it's almost...
Let me get my coat. <+++++> Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.
Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see. <+++++> He won't?
All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it. <+++++> No, you don't.
Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled? <+++++> Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type "little", the idiot.
Just a waitress? <+++++> No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?
What are you doing out there? <+++++> I am, uh, I am...
No. <+++++> No?
No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking. <+++++> Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.
What? <+++++> What're you talkin' about?
C'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun. <+++++> Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end?
Hi honey. <+++++> Oh you guys are not gonna believe what happened.
What? <+++++> Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and he grabs the table and he pulls himself up. He pulled himself up. Standing man. I'm sorry you guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it.
You can watch our tape if you want. <+++++> I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?
Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing. He can't quite say mama yet, but once he said yumen. <+++++> Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen , I mean, I feel like-
Great. That would be fine. <+++++> Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared.
Oh shout, that would have been fun. <+++++> Oh look, did, did you just see that? Did you see? He just waved, he just waved, he's never waved before, you've never waved before. Yes he has. Very good.
Yeah, a woman I went to college with just became the first female blacksmith down there. <+++++> Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg.
Think I better go before mommy starts weeping. <+++++> Buy mommy.
We love you. Buy. <+++++> Have a good time. Ok, Ben.
Ross. <+++++> Yeah.
How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me? <+++++> Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.
Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks. <+++++> Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.
With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia? <+++++> Thank you.
No luck huh? <+++++> Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.
Uh, I'm holding Ben. <+++++> Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb.
Ok. <+++++> Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.
This is how I would hold a football. <+++++> Ok, here, here. There we go.
Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I haven't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one. <+++++> It's alright, it's no big deal.
Really? <+++++> Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby.
What? <+++++> What?
You think about stuff like that? <+++++> Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.
Two, two babies? <+++++> Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.
Then what's gonna happen? <+++++> Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.
Uh-huh. <+++++> Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.
Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what. <+++++> Huh?
Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles. <+++++> 
I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes. <+++++> Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.
Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks. <+++++> C'mon, what, you never think about our future?
Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be. <+++++> No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.
What was the book? <+++++> The big book of childrens' names.
Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing. <+++++> Yeah.
But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that. <+++++> Ok fine.
Thank you. <+++++> We're not done.
I didn't know that. <+++++> Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.
Fine, I will. <+++++> Good, 'cause I love you.
Oh yeah. <+++++> Yeah.
Well I love you too. <+++++> Well that's the first time we've said that.
Yes it is. <+++++> Well, I'm gonna kiss you.
Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter. <+++++> 
It's us. <+++++> Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together.
I'm sorry, what did you just say? Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben just said 'Hi'. <+++++> Wha, what?
Ben just said hi. <+++++> What, the word hi?
Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi. <+++++> Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything.
What did he say? <+++++> Something about hi.
We've got a cab waiting downstairs. <+++++> Well, this was fun. Uh, we should really do it again sometime, wha'dya say? Ok. Alright so I've got him.
Tuesday. <+++++> Tuesday right. Ok, bye you guys.
Take care. <+++++> Bye Ben.
We've gotta go, we've got that cab waiting. <+++++> Alright, alright, ok. Bye.
Bye. <+++++> Bye.
Bye. <+++++> Bye.
Bye. <+++++> Bye.
Monica 's chicken parm! I'll take care of it.  Hey Mr. Treeger, it's Joey Tribbiani. Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandler's apartment. It's an emergency.  Uhh, gas leak! Yeah oh, and bring garlic bread. <+++++> Hey!
Did Rachel find you? <+++++> No why?
Oh she was looking for you. <+++++> Oh well, I guess I 'll catch up with her later.
Yeah, it seemed pretty important. <+++++> Oh no.
What? <+++++> I think I might know what this is about.
Really? <+++++> Yeah. Uh, uh we promised we weren 't gonna tell anybody this but uh, about a month ago Rachel and I slept together.
And? <+++++> Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked.
Oh sorry.  And?! <+++++> Well, we-we said we 'd just do it that one time but, but now I think she may wanna start things up again.
Yeah, I don 't think that's what it is. <+++++> Why? What-what else could it be?
Oh wow, I don 't feel well. <+++++> I 'm telling you. I'm telling you. That's what it is. No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn't say anything to you?
Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel. <+++++> Yeah, I guess I should.  Man, y 'know what I have to realize? Maybe I'm just not the type of guy women can have just one night with. Y'know, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that.
Hi! <+++++> Hi.
Hi.  Umm, I think there 's something that we really need to talk about. <+++++> I think we do. Why don 't we go inside?  Look uh, I know why you're here.
You do? <+++++> Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first.
Okay. <+++++> Okay.  Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That 's been one heck of a see-saw hasn't it?
What? <+++++> I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and and certainly passionate, but don't you think it's better if we just stayed friends?
Seriously. What?! <+++++> Okay. Okay. Y 'know what? If you want to, we can do it one more time. I mean I'd-I'd be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now.
Okay, y 'know what? Can I, can I talk now? <+++++> Oh sure.
Can I get you some water? <+++++> I 'm good. I'm good.
Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as you want. <+++++> Yeah, I need uh I 'm just-I don't know-I don't understand, umm, how this happened? We-we used a condom.
I know. I know, but y 'know condoms only work like 97% of the time. <+++++> What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!
They do! <+++++> No they don 't!!!  Well they should put it in huge black letters!!!!
Okay Ross come on let 's just forget about the condoms. <+++++> Oh well I may as well have!
Listen, y 'know what? I was really freaked out too when I found out <+++++> Freaked out? Hey no, I 'm not freaked out! I'm indignant! As a consumer!
Y 'know what? Let's, let's talk later. <+++++> No! No! I want to talk now! Okay? I -In fact,  I am going to talk to the president of the condom company!
Okay, y 'know maybe I should come back <+++++> Shh! Shh! Shh!
Okay. <+++++> Yeah I 'll press 1!
Whoa! This looks like an all day job, I 'll have to cancel my yoga class.  Hey Ross! <+++++> Hi.
Could you tell Jasmine that I won't make it to yoga class today? <+++++> Sure.
Namaste. <+++++> Namaste.
Namaste. <+++++> Oh my God! What happened to the door?!
So it 's noticeable huh? <+++++> Look, is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her.
Didn 't you two already talk? <+++++> Yeah but uh Okay, okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slept together, but there 's something else.  Rachel's pregnant.
Holy mother of God!!! <+++++> With my child.
That is brand new information!! <+++++> You already know don 't you?
How are you doing? <+++++> Okay. Okay. I mean I 'll be okay. It's just I don't think I handled it very well.
Well, what did you say to her? <+++++> Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone.
Oh Ross. <+++++> But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.
What? <+++++> I gotta go find her.
Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they don 't even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box! <+++++> Evidently they do.
Okay.  Oh man, I swear if they sold these at Pottery Barn <+++++> Hi!
Hi! <+++++> Uh we-we need to talk.
Uh-uh-uh, right now? Because I 've kinda got an el fresco situation going on over here. <+++++> Please, please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today.
Okay Ross that 's fine, but can you please stand near my head? <+++++> What? Oh yeah.  I 'm sorry. I mean I-I think I went a little crazy. I mean I was thinking about myself when I  really-I should have been thinking about you Rach
Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross! <+++++> Right! Right! I just -I want you to know that I'm going to be there through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctor's appointments, the uh, the Lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment-Although we could probably worry about that 'til after we get married.
What married? <+++++> Well yeah, I think we should get married.
What, because that 's your answer to everything? <+++++> No, because that 's the right thing to do.
Yeah, maybe if you 're in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are we? <+++++> No but but still you can't possibly do this alone.
Excuse me? <+++++> Come on Rach, you can 't even eat alone in a restaurant.
What?! <+++++> I 'm just saying if you can't eat by yourself, how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?
I can too eat by myself! <+++++> When have you ever?
When certain people leave the table and I am not finished! <+++++> Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!
Oh please, you inhale your food! <+++++> I grew up with Monica! If you didn 't eat fast you didn't eat!!
Oh no Dr. Long, please come in. This is Ross, he is the father. <+++++> But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone.
Huh. Nice to meet you. I 'll get started on this. <+++++> I don 't know why you can't admit that you need me.
Okay, everything looks good. Here it is on the screen.  Here is your uterus. And right here is your baby. <+++++> Oh my God.
Okay. <+++++> Thank you.
Thank you. <+++++> Pretty amazing huh?
I don 't see it! <+++++> What? What?!
I can 't see it! <+++++> You-you just said that you did!
I know, I lied! I didn 't want her to think I was a terrible mother! I can't even see my own baby! <+++++> Oh sure, come here!  Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,  it 's-it's-it's, it's right there .
Oh. Oh, it 's beautiful. I see it now. <+++++> Do you really?
No, I don 't see it! <+++++> Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this?  This tiny thing that looks like a peanut?
Yeah. <+++++> Sweetie that 's it.
That 's it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you. <+++++> You 're welcome.
Wow! I can 't believe that's our baby. <+++++> Yeah, that 's our baby.
Good. <+++++> Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus.
Oh no, I know I couldn 't see it either at first, but it's right umm  Ross, I lost it again. <+++++> Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.
Umm Wow, all right.  Wow! Yay! Ooh, I 'm gonna meet a guy! And really soon! And he's gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night. <+++++> Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? It 's a button down, like a, like a faded salmon?
You mean your pink shirt? <+++++> Faded salmon color.
No, I-I haven 't seen your pink shirt. <+++++> Great! Great. Then I must 've left it at Mona's. I knew it!
Well, I 'm sure you get another one at Ann Taylor 's. <+++++> That 's my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!
Well just ask Mona to give it back! <+++++> I don 't know. I mean I-I guess I could. It's just that we didn't really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I'd be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die.
Oh my God! Ross!!! <+++++> Hello!!
Ross, what are you doing?! <+++++> Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.
Listen Ross, you don 't have to apologize. I understand why you were there. <+++++> You do?
Yeah, you still have feelings for me. And-and to be honest, I-I still have feelings for you. And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we can 't. It's too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just It just wasn't meant to be. <+++++> Oh God you 're right.
Ross, we we have to be strong. Okay, I-I'm gonna go.  Can I? To remember you? <+++++> No.
Who wrote it? <+++++> Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
Oh hey, do you still have their final exams? <+++++> Yeah.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl? <+++++> It 's a girl! Anyway, it wou-it wouldn't matter. Okay? Because I'm a teacher and she 's a student.
Oh, is that against the rules? <+++++> No, but it is frowned upon.
I see. <+++++> Besides, there 's a big age difference.
Oh, well think of it like this, when you 're 90 <+++++> I know when I 'm 90 she'll be like 80 and it won't seem like such a big difference.
Professor Geller? <+++++> Yeah?
I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class. <+++++> Oh thank you. Thanks very much.  Ow!
Uh, I'm a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation <+++++> That was you?
Yeah. I felt a little weird about it. You're a teacher. I'm a student. But would you maybe want to go out with me sometime? <+++++> Oh I, I don 't-I don't think that would be the best idea.
Oh, because I was thinking, the semester's over; you're not my teacher anymore. <+++++> What time?
Oh, y'know what? Forget it, you already gave me an A. <+++++> Gotcha.
I'm kidding! <+++++> Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me! <+++++> What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
Who? <+++++> Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone 's name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me? <+++++> Umm, no. No.
Yes you did! What was it? <+++++> Umm, it 's Cutie McPretty.
Ohh that 's so sweet! <+++++> Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I 'm having a great time! Y'know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it's not. I mean it's not at all.
Dr. Geller! <+++++> Burt!
So it 's okay to date a student. <+++++> Well, not really. I mean technically it 's-it's not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
Well Ross, you be careful now. You don 't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents. <+++++> Yeah. What-what should I do?
What?! You 're going out with her again! <+++++> Going out with who?
Uh, Dana Keystone from college. <+++++> Oh yeah! Wasn 't she uh
Uhh, I can 't. <+++++> Oh, you have some studying to do?
No, I have some turning 21 to do. <+++++> Y 'know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to
What are you doing? <+++++> Nothing, I 'm-I'm just, I'm so comfortable with you!
Do you not want to be seen with me? <+++++> What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?
Uh no, they 're still here but I think I'm about to leave. <+++++> What?! No! No! Wait! You 're right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There's nothing wrong with that. Come on.  Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.
Aren 't you in my Popular Culture class? <+++++> That 's right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we're dating. And you may frown upon that, but we're not gonna hide it anymore.
You are so fired. <+++++> What?
They 're gonna fire you! You can't date a student! It's against the rules. <+++++> Really? Its not just frowned upon?
For what it 's worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more. <+++++> I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can 't date. It's against the rules. It's forbidden.
Wow! <+++++> What?
Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, it 's really hot. <+++++> Really?
Yeah. <+++++> Well I-I-I don 't care how hot it is it's-it's uh, it's wrong.
Stop it! <+++++> No! No! It 's wrong! It's-it's-it's naughty. It's taboo.
Shut the book! <+++++> Let 's also get a hot plate!
Yeah? Well, you should know. You 've bought like a billion of 'em. <+++++> Yeah, you didn 't get one.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Okay. Have a benefit. <+++++> Hey!
Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight? <+++++> Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.
Oh, so you 're already doing your part for the kids. <+++++> I 'm sorry, it's just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp-to be a counselor!
Do you really see this as a long-term thing? <+++++> I don 't know.
Y 'know, you are 12 years older than her. <+++++> Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?
Yeah! Yeah, sort of. I 'm sorry. <+++++> Uh-uh -Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn't really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I'm the one dating Elizabeth, not you!
It 's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck! <+++++> Yeah, yeah you have the ring?
Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she 's gonna know. <+++++> Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!
Shut the door! Shut the door!! <+++++> What 's-what's going on?
The guys across the hall are throwing water balloons at us. <+++++> Oh, you have to call the police! That 's what I did to the kids in my building!
No, it 's a water balloon fight! We started it! <+++++> Oh!  Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, it 's supposed to be excellent. The director is the same
You want some?! <+++++> No! Okay! Okay!  Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to you for a second?
Yeah, sure. <+++++> Uh, so this play umm, what do you think? It 's-it's gotten great reviews! Y'know the uh
You put your balloons down!! <+++++> Everybody put their balloons down!!!  Now this is a nice suit!!
Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner! <+++++> Who?
Richard! <+++++> What?  A-ohh!  Ohh. Oh that 's right that's right. That's Richard's favorite place too.
I thought you were going out with Elizabeth. <+++++> Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can 't get out of! <+++++> Y 'know, maybe she is too young for me. Y'know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby- sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don't know what to do.
Why don 't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first  weighing stuff. <+++++> Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I 'm-I'm 12 years older than she is.
If the school finds out you 're fired. <+++++> Hmm.
For cam p! <+++++> Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she 's-she's sweet and pretty and
Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is,  "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her?  Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?! <+++++> No! No! I didn't do that. It's just Okay, honestly no. I don't, I don't see a big future with her.
Okay well I think that's your answer. <+++++> I 've got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.
Ross! Wait! <+++++> Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about
You suck!! <+++++> What?!
What?! <+++++> Okay, break-up 's still on!
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone. <+++++> What happened you guys?
What happened you guys? <+++++> Rach!
Hey you! <+++++> Hey, come on in.
Oh thank you. Hey y 'know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth. <+++++> Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we 'd be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn't meant to be.
Yeah, love. It 's a tricky business isn't it? <+++++> I guess so.
So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we 're 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we've-we've already slept together so y'know there'll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, "What's that?!" <+++++> Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.
Exactly. <+++++> Ohh, yeah I already have one.
What? Who? <+++++> Phoebe.
Phoebe?! Wait a -but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup. <+++++> Ohh, I don 't think so.
Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal! <+++++> That 's impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we- we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Phoebe! We 're both  your backup?! <+++++> Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!
No we weren 't! <+++++> I was not!
Pick me!! <+++++> No! Pick me! I don 't want to end up an old maid!
This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel! <+++++> Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!
Okay that 's fair. <+++++> All right.
So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. <+++++> Rach!
Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home. <+++++> Oh. This was amazing.
It really was. You've learned some new moves! <+++++> Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me "Sex for Dummies" as a joke.
Ah. <+++++> Who's laughing now?
Guess what? You're almost an uncle! <+++++> What?
Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now! <+++++> Oh my God!
Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl. <+++++> Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.
Have you seen him throw a ball? <+++++> Is Rachel here?
Uh, I think she's still asleep. Hey, hey, how did it go with you guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you. <+++++> Uh, we, y'know, we worked things out.
What's that smile? Did something happen with you two? <+++++> Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it!
Oh my God. You and Rachel? <+++++> I know, it's pretty great.
So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together? <+++++> Oh, I.. I don't know. We didn't really get to talk.
But do you wanna get back together? <+++++> I don't know. It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right. When I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go. You know what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together.
YAY! <+++++> Shhh!
So, so is she still going to Paris? <+++++> Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not.
Okay. <+++++> Hey.
Hey. <+++++> Hey. How did you sleep?
Good. You? <+++++> Good.
I bet you did! <+++++> Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?
Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm. <+++++> So...
So... <+++++> Morning.
You too. Last night was just wonderful. <+++++> It really was.
I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face. <+++++> I know, me too. It was... You know, it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's everything you want it to be.
Oh my God! What did you say? <+++++> Nothing! What do you say to that?
Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel! <+++++> No way!
You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do? <+++++> What?
Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. If she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go. <+++++> You really think so?
Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's. <+++++> Okay.
Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck, Emma! <+++++> Alright, you know what? You're right. I should at least tell her how I feel.
Ross, wait! <+++++> What? What?
Oh... Bye guys. <+++++> Oh my God!
Hey, you know what might help? <+++++> I'm not getting you a muffin!
No, I sat in the paint. <+++++> Hey.
Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel? <+++++> No, and I'm not going to.
Why not? <+++++> Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.
How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you slept together last night. <+++++> Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is.
Damn it! <+++++> Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now. Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time.
Oh, I made a little something. If I had more time to work on it, it'd be better, but.. <+++++> Oh my God! You did that yourself?
Oh my God! <+++++> Oh my God!
Hey. <+++++> Hey.
Oh. <+++++> Oh my God!
What... What... <+++++> Okay, okay, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two, right?
Yes, it's twins! <+++++> Oh my God.
Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad. <+++++> Aw, he's gonna be so happy.
I just want you to know.. Last night.. I'll never forget it. <+++++> Neither will I.
So, you just let her go? <+++++> Yeah.
Hey, maybe that's for the best. <+++++> Yeah?
Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get over her. <+++++> Yeah, that's true. Except I don't wanna get over her.
What? <+++++> I don't! I wanna be with her.
Really? <+++++> Yeah, I'm gonna go after her.
Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat! <+++++> My coat...
But Ross, Ross. What do you, what do you think she's going to say? <+++++> I don't know, but I.. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened. Where - where is my coat?!
You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to the airport. <+++++> Okay, guys, wish me luck.
That's okay. If - if we hit anything, the engine will explode, so you know, it's better if you're thrown from the car. <+++++> Alright, alright, let's do this!
Okay! <+++++> Hey!
Hey! The law says you have to accept any fare. <+++++> No, you don't understand. This isn't a real cab.
What? <+++++> Get out of the cab!
You can open your eyes now. <+++++> Are we off the bridge?
Yes. <+++++> Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
Yes, she jumped right back up. <+++++> Oh my God, Phoebe, slow down!
Do you wanna get to Rachel in time? <+++++> Yes, but I don't wanna die in your cab!
Toll-booth. <+++++> What?
Hurry! <+++++> Okay!
Ross, where are you going? <+++++> To talk to Rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the death-cab?
What? What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? Have you never chased anyone through the airport before? <+++++> Not since my cop-show got cancelled.
You have to get a ticket to get past security. <+++++> What? We're never gonna make it!
Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass! <+++++> Okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great.
Just one? I drive you all the way down here, and I don't get to see how it works out? <+++++> Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets.
And the destination? <+++++> I don't care. Whatever is the cheapest.
No, did we miss it? <+++++> No, no, no. That's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.
Hey, it's me. Here's Ross. <+++++> What? Hey, hey, listen..
Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making. Listen. <+++++> Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?
Oh, I'm sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before. <+++++> That's alright. Listen, listen.
Oh, wait, wait, wait! Here they go again. <+++++> Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?
Isn't that cute? <+++++> That is precious! Listen! I need Rachel's flight information.
Oh, okay. Alright, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8 <+++++> Yes, that's what I have. It's not on the board.
That's what it says here. Flight 421, leaves at 8 <+++++> What?
Newark airport. Why, where are you? <+++++> JFK.
Well, I've never gone this fast before. <+++++> Phoebe, forget it, okay? Newark is - is like an hour away. There's no way we're gonna make it in time.
She's got her cell, you could call her. <+++++> I am not doing this over the phone.
For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport. <+++++> Yay.
Yes, the Philange is fixed. As a matter of fact, we put a whole lot of extra Philanges onboard, just in case. <+++++> Where is she?
I don't see her. <+++++> Rachel! Rachel Green!
There she is! <+++++> Rachel! Rachel!
Wow, excuse me, sir, do you have a boarding pass? <+++++> No, no, I just have to talk to someone.
I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass. <+++++> No, no, no, but...
What? What? Ross, you're scaring me. What's going on? <+++++> Okay, the thing is..
Yeah? <+++++> Don't go.
What? <+++++> Please, please stay with me. I am so in love with you. Please, don't go.
Oh my God. <+++++> I know, I know. I shouldn't have waited 'till now to say it, but I'm.. That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry, but I'm telling you now. I love you. Do not get on this plane.
Miss? Are you boarding the plane? <+++++> Hey, hey. I know you love me. I know you do.
I - I have to get on the plane. <+++++> No, you don't.
Yes, I do. <+++++> No, you don't.
They're waiting for me, Ross. I can't do this right now, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. <+++++> Rachel?
I'm so sorry. <+++++> I really thought she'd stay.
Ross, hi. It's me. I just got back on the plane. And I just feel awful. That is so not how I wanted things to end with us. It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you, and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... And... And now I'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have said, and I didn't. I mean, I didn't even get to tell you that I love you too. Because of course I do. I love you. I love you. I love you. What am I doing? I love you! Oh, I've gotta see you. I've gotta get off this plane. <+++++> Oh my God!
Miss, I can't let you off the plane. <+++++> Let her off the plane!
Oh, please, miss, you don't understand! <+++++> Try to understand!
Oh, come on, miss, isn't there any way that you can just let me off... <+++++> No! No! Oh my God. Did she get off the plane? Did she get off the plane?
I got off the plane. <+++++> You got off the plane.
I do love you. <+++++> I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again.
Okay. 'Cause this is where I wanna be, okay? No more messing around. I don't wanna mess this up again. <+++++> Me neither, okay? We are - we're done being stupid.
Okay. You and me, alright? This is it. <+++++> This is it. Unless we're on a break.
This is it. Unless we're on a break. <+++++> Don't make jokes now.
If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing. <+++++> Wow.
Oh, yeah, that's true. <+++++> Uh, I haven't.
Wait a minute. What about that summer during college that you lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer? <+++++> Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up?
