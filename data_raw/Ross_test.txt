Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home. <+++++> Oh. This was amazing.
Wow! <+++++> What?
everybody we know? Yeah. <+++++> Great. Thanks!
Are you Joey? <+++++> Huh. This is nice.
No, you cannot. <+++++> Thanks for the help, problem solved.
What? <+++++> Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
You got it! <+++++> Thanks!  Thank you!
If you hadn't just had a baby with my best friend I swear to Lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your danglers RIGHT NOW! <+++++> well Phoebe, I think you'll feel better when you know a little bit about Vicrum, His a Kite designer  and he used to date Oprah.
Ross, what 's the big deal? So I kissed the guy! <+++++> He is my girlfriend 's father, okay? It's-it's, it's weird!
Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job. <+++++> How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
Yeah, he's the handy man. He's gonna be retiring next week and everyone who lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of thing. <+++++> Oh that's nice.
We're looking into it. <+++++> I, uh, I'll go see.
It took you that long to figure it out, huh? <+++++> Well I 'm, I'm a little slow.  Just as our children would be.
Sex in his chair. <+++++> What, uh... what were you thinking?
Uh-huh. <+++++> Keep dancing.
Love what you've done with the place. <+++++> Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. <+++++> Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.
I am not wrong. <+++++> You're wrong.
What? <+++++> Please, please stay with me. I am so in love with you. Please, don't go.
What? <+++++> Did you just say  "break up with Charlie"?
Okayyyyy, open up! <+++++> What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!
You seem to really like her. <+++++> Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y 'know no commitment.
Well you 're not gonna be able to keep doing this. <+++++> Well I have to. Okay? If I don 't, they'll take the class away from me. And I already put it in my family newsletter.
Oh, thanks, sweetie. <+++++> No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
I don't see why not. <+++++> Here's my retainer!
No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today. <+++++> Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?
Yeah, sorry boys, this ride's closing. <+++++> Oh, and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing. I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond.
I have an audition, but I 'll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon? <+++++> Somewhere maybe along the equator?
Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad. <+++++> What?
Well that's not a third nipple. <+++++> No?
So, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest? <+++++> What? Rach! Come on, that's terrible! They're uh they're babies. They're-they're all beautiful.
Ross! <+++++> I 'll be right there.   Hello!  Hello!  Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan.
Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time. <+++++> Hopefully.
Yeah. I felt a little weird about it. You're a teacher. I'm a student. But would you maybe want to go out with me sometime? <+++++> Oh I, I don 't-I don't think that would be the best idea.
Picturing that tree? <+++++> I am, yes.
And the destination? <+++++> I don't care. Whatever is the cheapest.
I 'm fine, I'm fine. <+++++> No you 're not.
Thank you! Thank you! <+++++> Yeah, yeah!  You sure this is what you want?
Yes, you're having a boy! <+++++> I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
Okay. Wait! Wait! <+++++> Emily.
Ooh, it's not a toy. <+++++> Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do.  Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again?  Ask again later. Later is not good enough.  Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!
Oh, but of course it is! <+++++> Okay, what does it mean?
She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us. <+++++> In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in. <+++++> I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm
So, so, did you hear? <+++++> Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!
Open it! Open it! Open it! <+++++> Yeah baby!
From the land down under? I didn't know that either! <+++++> So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?
Oh no-no, I 'm fascinated by paleontology. Have you read the new Walter Alvarez book? <+++++> Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.
its Mike Hanagen <+++++> Oh Ross Geller
Not once. <+++++> I thought so.
Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could-  -I'd want yours. <+++++> Must pee.
And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law. <+++++> Oh!... Right!
Who are those people? <+++++> Got me.
Where's my underwear?! <+++++> Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?
Later! <+++++> Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out. <+++++> I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers.
Seriously? <+++++> Yeah-uh!
Where 'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents. <+++++> Yeah.
Hey! <+++++> Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
Hey!  How 's it going? <+++++> Good.
Just once! <+++++> Stay away!
How could you have kept all of this from me? <+++++> I was going to tell you, but
Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house. <+++++> Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?
I'm just saying, I have a cabin in the Adirondacks if you ever want to get away from the city, well, that'd be  just nifty! <+++++> Ooh, well. Ah, I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man.
Exellent dream score. <+++++> Why, why, why would you dream that?
Sorry. <+++++> Hi. Sorry I'm late. Where's, where's Carol?
Your cappucino sir. <+++++> Thank you.
Oh! Me too! <+++++> Well look-look I 'm not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million years ago!
Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance. <+++++> Ah, that 's okay, thanks.
Alright, let's take this outside. <+++++> Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that?
All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go! <+++++> Good luck!
Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good. <+++++> Good for a scrud.
Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper? <+++++> No! Why?
A meatball Sub? Thanks! <+++++> Seriously you guys, what's going on? What are these for?
Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute! <+++++> Oww!
Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.' <+++++> But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.
Hey, what's going on? <+++++> Oh, we just...
Ooh. <+++++> Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?
That 's right, still no baby!  Come on people! Please make some room! <+++++> Uh sweetie, maybe you 'd be more comfortable here?
No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god. <+++++> Ugh.
Yeah. That's me! <+++++> You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?
Hi! <+++++> Hey!
Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily. <+++++> What?! You totally get embarrassed!
Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles. <+++++> 
You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it? <+++++> Learn about Jesus...
Yeah, and I'm so, so sorry, Ross, I'm sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat.  I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have have a great one! <+++++> It's not the best!
Oh umm, y 'know I think it would be better if we just save it. <+++++> Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that.
Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now!  Oh, thank you! <+++++> Okay, you go grab it!
Can you hold on a moment? I have another call.  I love her. <+++++> I know.
Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones! <+++++> Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!
You wanna return this couch?  It's cut in half! <+++++> That's what I'm telling you.
Do you always have to bring him here? <+++++> I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
Hi. <+++++> Hey.
Isn 't it a beautiful wedding?! <+++++> Yes, yes it is. It 's uh  Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
Life partner. <+++++> Like buddies.
Y'know Ross why don 't you put that on your answering machine! <+++++> Hey-hey, it 's valid okay? And I'm not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me.
No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means  "you're gonna get eaten by a bear". <+++++> Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
I think she 's checking out your beehive Ross. <+++++> What?!  Give-give me a brush.
Is your finger caught in that chair? <+++++> Mmm hmmm.
Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this. <+++++> Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.
Okay. <+++++> Okay, you ready?
Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned. <+++++> Awww.
Wiener, Wiener  Wiener, Wiener!!! <+++++> Rachel!!!
Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler? <+++++> That's a good point.
My brother, Ross. <+++++> Hey.
Here's your scone. <+++++> Oh, thanks Gunther.  STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!
No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now. <+++++> Tho?
' I drink tea. ' <+++++> Okay, that's, that's enough.
Texas? <+++++> That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben.  Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.
Where's Monica? <+++++> Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.
Right. <+++++> About the yelling.
What 's up? <+++++> Oh, I 'm just over here with Ben. I thought we'd say hi.
OK. <+++++> OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that 's okay. <+++++> Oh shoot, tomorrow 's not so good, I'm supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.
Ah.  Slow swimmers? <+++++> What?! What do you mean? You-you-you 're not pregnant?
Oh God! <+++++> Oh, I know.
Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be. <+++++> Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
Right. <+++++> Okay. Honey?
What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge! <+++++> What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!
I don 't know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other <+++++> Oh.
Are you wearing my glasses? <+++++> Yes.
Might wanna open with the snowman. <+++++> Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.
Yeah! His name is um, Mark something. <+++++> Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.
were you this irritating? <+++++> Wow!
Uh, I'm a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation <+++++> That was you?
Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay? <+++++> That'd be good...
I just want you to know.. Last night.. I'll never forget it. <+++++> Neither will I.
Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please? <+++++> All right, fine.
That's funny. Who are they? <+++++> The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
Sting 's son, seven years old and there's a picture. <+++++> What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?
No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here is the puncture wound from your ring. <+++++> Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate.
You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise! <+++++> What? How come that you don't have to go!
If she 's no fun, why do you want to date her at all? <+++++> Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y 'know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was-if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist.
-Peaches? <+++++> Actually, nectarines, but basically...
Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here. <+++++> Yeah.
No! All he 's thinking about is how you're taking this! I mean, listen it's totally freaking him out. He's talking about moving to Vermont. <+++++> Why?
Then don't touch one!! <+++++> Hi!
Yeah, right. Look at you, you 're practically giddy. <+++++> No, I 'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.
I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my... <+++++> Alright...
Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough. <+++++> Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?
C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to. <+++++> 
Come on! Why are we here?! <+++++> Okay, okay take a guess.
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable. <+++++> Fine, I 'm mentally unstable.
Well, y 'know he lost his keys so he was looking for them <+++++> In your mouth?!
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You 're not Elizabeth's dad?! <+++++> Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.
Oh. Oh, it 's beautiful. I see it now. <+++++> Do you really?
That's great! <+++++> In London!
You really should have been more clear about that! <+++++> Hey!
Yeah, y 'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella.  So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married! <+++++> Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily 's parents got married here.
One. <+++++> One.
Hello. <+++++> Will!
No! No-no they 're not. They're still very angry! But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet. <+++++> Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more
Ross! <+++++> What?! What?
Oh, it 's so great to see you feeling like this! <+++++> Hey!
How can I help you? <+++++> Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
No! No, of course not. No. That 's why I brought it up.  They didn't have any sodas? <+++++> Oh my God! I 'm sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot.
Hi! Hi. Hi, Rachel!  What's she doing here? <+++++> I have no idea!
That 's great. I worry about little Ross. He's always reading, he's collecting rocks and he's obsessed with dinosaurs. <+++++> He 'll be fine.
Look, you guys have been to every play I 've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage? <+++++> No.
Come on, Ross, that didn 't mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody. <+++++> Yeah that 's what she said.
So what 's going on with you? <+++++> Well umm, I 've been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.
What that woman... did. I am not doin ' that. It's just gonna have to stay in, that's all, everything will be the same, it'll just stay in. <+++++> Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everything's gonna be alright.
Thank you.  Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there 's no turning back. <+++++> Yeah, I 'm-I'm sure.  Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind.
Dude relax! It could happen to anyone. <+++++> Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I don 't know any of it and I'm the father. I wish I'd be more involved y'know.
Hey, Pheebs! Hi! <+++++> Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?
Yeah, it 's a very large plane. <+++++> That 's cool.
Then free as a bird. What 's up? <+++++> My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you 're doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on. <+++++> Yeah.
Ooooh! Freeze him out. <+++++> That 's right!
You have to get a ticket to get past security. <+++++> What? We're never gonna make it!
I think we gotta end the freeze out. <+++++> Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?
Hey, what have you guys been up to? <+++++> Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!! <+++++> Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!
You don't. <+++++> Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.
What is going on? <+++++> What's going on?!  That's what's going on!!
Ross, did you really read all these baby books? <+++++> Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that!
You two are really gonna enjoy that couch. <+++++> Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together.
No, it was just the three of us. <+++++> Huh!
Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing? <+++++> Dr. Franzblau, hi.
All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots. <+++++> Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
Hey. <+++++> What?
Yes!  Y-E-S. Yes! <+++++> Let me see this...  Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division.
I'll ask.  Boohaki? <+++++> Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.
I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know! <+++++> Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?
Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that. <+++++> Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
Do we have to tell her? <+++++> Yes, we have to tell her!
Yeah, everything 's fine! <+++++> Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?
Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? <+++++> Got me.
Ohhh. <+++++> Hey guys!
Yeah... <+++++> Hey.
My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do. <+++++> Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World.
Oh yeah, no, what 's that? <+++++> If like the four of us could all y 'know, hang out together. Uh, in fact Emily's coming into town this weekend, why don't you say we all have dinner? Say, Sunday night?
I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well. <+++++> No, no, no, no!
That sounds like my first bike.  My dad gave me his old one. <+++++> Ohh.
Sorry. <+++++> Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything 's gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come on.
Right. <+++++> Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?
Thanks! <+++++> Okay!  Hey Tommy.
I'm sorry. <+++++> Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there.
Little bit. <+++++> No!
Yeah! Yeah, sort of. I 'm sorry. <+++++> Uh-uh -Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn't really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I'm the one dating Elizabeth, not you!
Yeah? <+++++> Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.
Oh no. <+++++> Yeah, I'm missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.
Well I got stuff going on in here  if you wanna feel. <+++++> Look, I-I don 't want to miss anymore baby stuff. So Here. Here's my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! I'll be there! Okay? I don't care if it's three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.
Coffee. <+++++> Okay.
He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it... <+++++> Well, if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him?
He didn 't ask me to marry him. <+++++> Ohh.
Okay, we're on it. We're on it. <+++++> Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um.
Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. <+++++> You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
Seriously. What?! <+++++> Okay. Okay. Y 'know what? If you want to, we can do it one more time. I mean I'd-I'd be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now.
Ross, you're like my best friend. <+++++> I know.
Because! She 's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me. <+++++> Okay, all right, I 'll take you. I'll go call Joan.
Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long. <+++++> I know. My arm is killing me.
Good! <+++++> I know, why not?
Oh that 's a nickname we were trying out. <+++++> Hey, y 'know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron!
Well I love you too. <+++++> Well that's the first time we've said that.
Okay, who 's next?! <+++++> No-o-o!  No way!
Cool! <+++++> Yeah!
Oh, Ross... <+++++> What?
No! No, she 's-She was nice. I mean, she's a little slutty, but who isn't? <+++++> I liked her.
Wow, excuse me, sir, do you have a boarding pass? <+++++> No, no, I just have to talk to someone.
I thought you were going out with Elizabeth. <+++++> Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
What're you guys doing out here? <+++++> Well, not playing raquetball!
Does it? <+++++> Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole  'Does it?' part just another glance.
What about the rest of Manhattan?! <+++++> Yeah, they all know.
Uh, that's our friend Tanya. <+++++> Of course it's your friend Tanya.
Ahh, I don 't believe you. I think you don't want them to see you begging me. <+++++> Rachel, please
OK, listen I 've been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It's a show, but we're just dancing, OK? It's no big deal. The important thing to remember - stay cool. <+++++> Got it!
Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?! <+++++> What do I do now?
I got no sleep last night! <+++++> Why?
I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you!  I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. <+++++> Whaddya see?
Morning. <+++++> Hey.
Hey! <+++++> Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married.  We register, and you get to keep all the presents!
You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. <+++++> Oh my God.
But Ross, I 'm such having a great time! Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make- believe tea parties. <+++++> Monica said that did she?
Does it still hurt? <+++++> Yeah.
Did I go to this school? <+++++> Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her.
One more time from the top... I like big butts and I cannot lie, you other br... <+++++> Rachel please! That is so inappropriate!
Oh God! <+++++> No seriously. I have job security for life. You know, I never have to worry.  Oh, look at you. Look how happy you are for me.
Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage. <+++++> Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for all hanging out but to come to my home!
Do I know why we 're rushing? <+++++> Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?  Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
What is it? <+++++> I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself. <+++++> Are you sure she 's in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma's glycoma medicine again?
Oh. <+++++> Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a two some with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
Hi! <+++++> Wow! Uh how are you?
Ross, what're you doing. <+++++> I'm getting ready for the water skiing.
Hi! <+++++> Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.
Hi. <+++++> Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can 't sleep without it.
Nooo, I said we needed a new plan. <+++++> And, I came up with Atlantic City.
No no no, no no no, neat, as in no rocks. <+++++> I know.
No, actually, see I had to pee, 'cause I can't use public bathrooms because the doodie parasites. <+++++> Ok, Michelle, it's time to go.
Like a date type  person? <+++++> Yeah, kinda. It 's this woman from work. I hope that won't be too weird. Will it, Rach?
What 'd I get? <+++++> Seven.
OH.....MY.....GAWD!! <+++++> OH.....MY.....GOD!!
Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy. <+++++> What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?
Shhh! I want to hear the rest! <+++++> Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words  "Will you marry me?"
Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game. <+++++> Wow, how many have you got?
Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that! <+++++> Okay!
Hi. <+++++> Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie.
No! I 'm putting that in my room. <+++++> Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don 't you think you could at least hear the guy out?
What are the odds? What are the odds? <+++++> Okay, that-that 's enough! Y'know, let's, let's let someone else play.
Hey. <+++++> Hey!
Oh my God! <+++++> Oh my God!
I say push her down the stairs. <+++++> 
But y 'know what, if you think it's gonna be okay we'll just work out a system. Y'know, it'll be like college, I'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, "Come back later, I'm gettin' lucky." <+++++> Yeah, I didn 't think of that.
Maybe they do. I've been doin' this ten years and I haven't gotten anywhere. There's gotta be a reason. <+++++> Oh c'mon. Maybe you're just, uhhh... paying your dues.
Want us to go? <+++++> Uh-huh.
Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us. <+++++> I don't know...
Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore? <+++++> Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the  "I get to see my wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this.
All right. When is, when is the next flight out? <+++++> About four hours.
If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can. <+++++> Ohh... OK.
Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today. <+++++> Oh my god.
So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win, remember? <+++++> Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon...
Oh no Dr. Long, please come in. This is Ross, he is the father. <+++++> But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone.
I 'm not on the list! <+++++> Um, see, but that 's not the final draft.
Hey. <+++++> Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
I did. <+++++> Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here -but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
No, we haven't seen her since this morning. <+++++> So unbelievable. She was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with Emma.
No <+++++> Joey what-what were you thinking?!
Ah, poke  a  nose, mmm <+++++> Mma, Mma, Mmaah
But you didn 't give it to her? <+++++> No!
You 're going down. <+++++> Oh yeah? You 're going further down! Downtown!
Oh I do!  Oh, y 'know what? No.  Wait a second.  I know it's in here somewhere. <+++++> Y 'know what? I'm good! I'm good!
What if I smack my head on the concrete? <+++++> Well, I 'm gonna lie to you Joey, it's a possibility.
Oh, that was our favourite game show ever! <+++++> Except for "Match game"...
And you know Monica and Ross! <+++++> Hi Jill.
I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me. <+++++> There was never a good time.
I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left. <+++++> Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be.
Sorry. <+++++> It's morphin time!
Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this. <+++++> No, that 's all right.
This game makes no sense! <+++++> Y 'know what? You're just upset because you're losing.
Okay, bye!! <+++++> So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?
All right. <+++++> Thank you!
All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid. <+++++> I'll do it!
That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever. <+++++> Alright, I want my monkey.
Yeah, umm that 's Whitney , Kyle's ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y'know divert her so that we can slip out? <+++++> What?! No!
Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience! <+++++> You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?
Oh hi. It's, it's Mark. <+++++> Oh hey, hey Mark.
You are undressing very quickly. <+++++> Six months Rachel, six months.
Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it 's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle. <+++++> Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?
And, by the way, I really enjoyed your paper on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis. <+++++> Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute.
Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah! <+++++> Hey!
I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants. <+++++> Nice!
You 'd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me? <+++++> Yes.
All right.  Okay, here we go! <+++++> All right, ready?
Yes. Yes! Please, come in. <+++++> Oo-oo!
You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work. <+++++> Well, what do you do?
Yeah! Yes! <+++++> Okay, each team will answer ten questions. The first team that answers the most questions wins. Okay, the categories are, Fears and Pet Peeves, Ancient History, Literature, and It 's All Relative. Now, the coin toss to see who goes first.  Okay, somebody call it this time.
Don't do that to yourself. Any one of us could have tripped over that little girls jump-rope. <+++++> So, listen guys, are we uh, are we ok here?
Hey! <+++++> Shhh! We 're not talking.
Cut it out. <+++++> 
Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?! <+++++> It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
Are you ok, Ross? <+++++> I don't know. What's in this pie?
Aren't you gonna... <+++++> Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.
No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable. <+++++> Hey!
No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert. <+++++> No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together.
Your thumb? That 's weird.  You sure you're punching right? Make a fist.  Maybe later. Ross I feel terrible. <+++++> You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms.
Okay, Santa! <+++++> All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.
Well, they 're just gonna have to wait aren't they? I've only got two hands!! <+++++> Need some help?
Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area? <+++++> You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?
No. <+++++> Remember? You-you were eating pizza.
Neat. <+++++> Cool.
Hey sweetie! <+++++> WOW!
Hey! <+++++> Hi! Hey!
Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to. <+++++> It was, it was her voice.
I will think about it. <+++++> That 's all I'm askin'
Hi. And batting for Sarah, Ross Geller, 872. Although, it looks like you bought an awful lot of cookies yourself. <+++++> Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.
Let her know I like her? What are you, insane?  It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem?  I'm right, right? <+++++> Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.

Third one from the left? <+++++> Yeah, why is it staring at me? I think it knows I'm talking about it.  Don't-don't you-Wh-Wha-Hey!!
You really think so? <+++++> I really do.
Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross? <+++++> Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ....
Oh my God!! <+++++> I've lost the will to live.
Oh we just -we drove each other crazy! <+++++> Yeah.
You really like it? <+++++> Dude! How-how did you write this?
She you in the parking lot. <+++++> No, Rach!
What the hell was that?! <+++++> A lesson in the importance of unagi.
Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say,  "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut buash?" <+++++> Yeah that's the same.
What? What is it? <+++++> Oh, major shampoo explosion!
What? <+++++> That's right, sex is off the table.  I am never having sex with you again.  Dr. Green, are you feeling better?
No, you know what, I think you should go. <+++++> What?
Uh-hmm. <+++++> What do you like better flora or fauna?
C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head. <+++++> Saw your head. Saw your head.
Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful. <+++++> Yeah, he's head of the department.
Hey! <+++++> Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I 'd take that bad boy out for a little spin.
Oh, it's perfect! <+++++> How about you?
Well, there you go! <+++++> Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.
How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me? <+++++> Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.
Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died. <+++++> I can't believe this.
Okay, but if you can't no dinner! <+++++> You're on!
Sure! <+++++> Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn 't stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a first bike, so
Ohh, okay, I 'm sorry. You're right. Y'know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you 're asking of me. <+++++> I 'm asking you to do me a favor.
Okay, you ready for the last picture? <+++++> Yeah.
Yeah? Really? No one 's home? <+++++> I don 't think so. Hello?  When you get in there
I know! <+++++> What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?
Wh-what's that? <+++++> It's from Ross, it's a love bug.
Oh, but it 's made her so happy. <+++++> Little girl misses her cat.  Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.  Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
I cannot believe you. <+++++> What?
Yeah. <+++++> Well I-I-I don 't care how hot it is it's-it's uh, it's wrong.
Maybe. Joey <+++++> He finally asked you out?
I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop? <+++++> Hmm.
Thanks. <+++++> Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.
See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder! <+++++> Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
I need to talk to you, it 's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler. <+++++> Oh my God! Of course, of course.  Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other 's hometowns? Why don't you   Wh-what's going on?
What the hell!!! <+++++> what's up, Dad?
Oh, she 's got you running errands, y'know, picking up wedding dresses  Wah-pah! <+++++> What 's wah-pah?
Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go. <+++++> Okay, go left. Left! Left!
I care! <+++++> And so do I.
So, uh, how was your day? <+++++> Oh you know, pretty much the usual, uh, sun shining, birds chirping.
I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy. <+++++> Huh.
Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I 've ever gotten. <+++++> You 're welcome.
I stole Monica 's and changed the name. <+++++> You can 't do that!
Well maybe you can cut me some slack. I 'm sort of in love. <+++++> Well I 'm sorry but, that-that's really not my problem.
She's in her room, why? <+++++> I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! .  Oh! My God! You're breathtaking!
Well if-if that 's what it is, then it's-it's crazy. <+++++> Monica 's right. We're talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can't just rush into this.
No, I 'm fine. <+++++> Really? You don 't think that's a little inappropriate.
What about it? <+++++> Gimme back my monkey.
I've been following your career for years, I-I can't wait for your keynote speech. <+++++> Wow! This is very flattering, uh...
Well, why are you doing this anyway? <+++++> Well, you should 've seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he's like Joe Rugby.
Pretty much. <+++++> Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?
Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding. <+++++> What?
Oh yeah! <+++++> Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there's this one thing Okay,  here goes. I made a promise that--Oh hey!
Oh! My number is on there.  Give me a call. <+++++> I will give you a call.
Really? You can actually see it? <+++++> You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.
Or... Dick. <+++++> Hey.
Hey, what have you guys been up too? <+++++> Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.
I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant. <+++++> Ah, he didn 't uh, take it so well?
No <+++++> you look great.
OOOOOHHHHH! <+++++> Hey, hey!!
The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so... <+++++> The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.
You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds. <+++++> Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?
What? <+++++> I'm Ross Geller. Wha, I'm, God in your add you said you were pretty but wow.
Oh, they said uh,  "You don't have insurance here, so stop calling us." <+++++> You didn 't tell her?!  Okay, fine! Pheebs?
Well, call me! <+++++> Ok.
Just hear me out! <+++++> N-no! Okay? We 've been through this! We're not gonna get married just because she's pregnant, okay?
Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want. <+++++> Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?
What do we do? What do we do? <+++++> Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.
Oh. Why didn 't you take her? <+++++> Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y 'know, we- we said our good-byes this morning, so
I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y 'know? And it's probably really hard for you to be alone right now. <+++++> You 're alone.
I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn 't be a secret, and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut. <+++++> Did I, did I even treat?
Come on you gotta have one! <+++++> Nope.
So hi! <+++++> Hi!
Well just ask Mona to give it back! <+++++> I don 't know. I mean I-I guess I could. It's just that we didn't really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I'd be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die.
You okay man? <+++++> Uh-huh. Thank Joey!
Okay. <+++++> Thanks.  I-I think I'm dying. I really do.
I felt it! <+++++> Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.
Hi Ross! <+++++> Hey Rachel.
That didn 't work on mom, it's not going to work on us. <+++++> Here, check it out. It 's the first one, too.
Come on! <+++++> Y 'know what? I don't like you without mom.  Come on.
Sure, what do you want to see? <+++++> I don't know, umm
My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine! <+++++> What?! That's not gonna make you any money!
Okay.  Oh man, I swear if they sold these at Pottery Barn <+++++> Hi!
Come here, check this out! <+++++> What? Is it the comet?
You're gonna kill me! <+++++> 15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12...
Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane. <+++++> Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
This is so much fun! <+++++> This is not fun!
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You 're not talking about Chuckles University?! <+++++> Okay!
Emily. <+++++> Oh no-no-no! Oh-no!  No! No! Emily!
Oh, okay, we 're going. Yeah. <+++++> Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
The exclamation point in the title scares me.  Y'know, it's not just Freud , it's Freud! <+++++> Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
What? <+++++> Ooh, Ooh.
Just think about it. If you don't, I'll talk more about humping. <+++++> Gimmie!
You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn 't even fit you anymore! <+++++> Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...
Well, just wake him up! <+++++> I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!
Yeah! <+++++> Well, I 'm not going to go now anyway .
Shh. Shh. Don 't try to talk, we'll get you up to your room, we'll soak your feet, you'll be okay. <+++++> Oh, thank you.

Yesss!! <+++++> Who 's Chip?
 <+++++> 
Bet she'd sleep with you now... <+++++> No... I already e-mailed her.
Okay, listen Robert... <+++++> Hey, don 't we have to...
Yeah, but so is this. <+++++> Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?
Yes he was. <+++++> No. No.
Phoebe and I are moving in together. <+++++> Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!
Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme? <+++++> After what I did? Can you blame her?
The reason we haven 't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this? <+++++> Okay, okay, I 'll tell 'em it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
Oh believe me, Ross, I won't be telling anybody about this. <+++++> Cool!
Oh, this is such a cute picture of Emma. And is this your son... or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation? <+++++> That's Ben, my son from my first marriage.
Oh my God! Calling from Rome!  Bon giorno, caro mio. <+++++> So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal! <+++++> That 's impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we- we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible. <+++++> That guy, he burns me up.
Ross and Emily have made their declarations and it gives me great pleasure to declare them husband and wife. <+++++> Yay!
Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?! <+++++> Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn 't. That's why I'm here. Maybe we could attack them together?  That-that's a no.
Excuse me? <+++++> Rach we have a code brown situation.
How do you figure that? <+++++> Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me. <+++++> What?
Thanks for having me over, you guys. <+++++> Tag? Y-You're going?  Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?
Okay, who are you talking to when you do that? <+++++> Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.
Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman. <+++++> Y'know this ??? is incredible.
Does a dog's lips move when he reads?  Okay, no they don't. <+++++> Hey guys!
All right, I 'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's. <+++++> Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I 'm trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I'm putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?
What 's the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler's! <+++++> And they knew about it?
You okay there, slugger? <+++++> Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
You can watch our tape if you want. <+++++> I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?
That 's true. You do have another child. <+++++> Yeah.
Hey. <+++++> Hey, where's Rach?
Y'know Marcel? <+++++> ...Yeah?
Is she in there? <+++++> Yeah. She 's putting her down now, that's her.
So that 's two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you. <+++++> Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
Here you go. <+++++> Thanks!
Um, coffee to go, please. <+++++> Isabella Rosselini.
What? <+++++> What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!
You don't have to seem so happy about it. <+++++> Oh, sorry. Well, look, maybe I can help you with it.
Well, I think it all started when you said,  "Hey Joey, why don't you be my best man." <+++++> All right-all right, fine! I-I 'm gonna call the cops!
The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you? <+++++> Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident...
Are you kidding me, I could stay and look at her forever. <+++++> Actually umm
Oww! <+++++> Oh my God, is that still...
I 'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade? <+++++> Y 'know what? She'd-she'd love this.  Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
OOH! God! Sorry! <+++++> I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver.
Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax. <+++++> Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game.
Thank you! So, did-did he get it? <+++++> No.
Bye! <+++++> Bye Janine!
Ezel. <+++++> Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?

I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin ' with you too! <+++++> Okay. Okay. Because for a minute you said you
Well, you 're practically dancing already. Why don't you just do it over here? <+++++> Oh, no, no.
Oh! What what what! ...Hi. <+++++> It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.
Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?! <+++++> Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!
Well, I 've just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn't have naked chicks on it. <+++++> Ohh! Okay! Okay.  "There are three  primary theories concerning sediment flow rate.   Each of these theories  can be further subcategorized  into "
Phoebe, that 's huge! <+++++> Well, do you wanna marry him?
Ok honey, you really need a job. <+++++> Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.
Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, I 've attended some of the finest medical schools in Central America. Well then, let's take a look at this skin abnormality of yours.  Come on, have a seat.  Eeh, huh. As I suspected, it's a koondis! <+++++> What 's a koondis?
We are aware of the problem you are referring too.  But as far as increasing security, I 'm afraid the library is very understaffed. I, I can't help you. <+++++> Well, fine. Fine! If-if I 'm the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I'll go up there and defend it myself!  And don't you follow me!
Caitlin! <+++++> Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating like this.
No. Why? <+++++> Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he 's leaving out 'e' and 'f.' It's like they just ah, I don't know, fell out of his head.
She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning. <+++++> Alright.
Well put it back. <+++++> It uhh, it won't go back.
Nooo, he 's leaving for a better job. <+++++> Oh well that 's great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh?  Good bye.
Oh, you haven't picked yet. Oh good, 'cause I had an idea. I thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog. Chappy. <+++++> What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose.
I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face. <+++++> I know, me too. It was... You know, it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's everything you want it to be.
Joey. <+++++> Open up. We want to talk to you.
Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it? <+++++> Oh, hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!
Yeah. <+++++> Hello.  Ah, no, she's not here right now. Can I take a message?  Bill from the bar?  Okay, "Bill from the bar." I'll make sure she gets your number.
How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad? <+++++> Hey, you guys.
Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed. <+++++> Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!
Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants? <+++++> Rach, have you never done this before?
Yes. <+++++> Um, you you like Rachel?
What?! <+++++> Oh but not that way. I mean I mean I'm not in love with her. I love her like a, like a friend.
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25? <+++++> Looks like a fun gang.
Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker. <+++++> Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here.
Gimme the keys! <+++++> No way!
You know it was you're uhm... birthday... <+++++> ...Valentine's day...
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way. <+++++> Still I could tell. She was into me.  Well, why don't you set us up?
You must be Ross. <+++++> Hi.
You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it 's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks! <+++++> It 's your joke.
Oh, y'know, it 's just like hats, and a shirt, and CD's, just sort of stuff that you've left here. <+++++> What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?
Hey! <+++++> Hi .
Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in! <+++++> JOEY!!!!!!
Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was! <+++++> C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.
Fancy guest. <+++++> Two seconds...
Because you 've only known her for six weeks! Okay, I've got a carton of milk in my fridge I've had a longer relationship with! <+++++> Look guys, when I 'm with her it's-it's-it's like she brings this- this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y'know?
Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on  "Days" I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy". <+++++> Wow. What does that mean?
Op! We gotta go! <+++++> Oh, where are you guys going?
What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman. <+++++> What?
Yes, you can, very much. <+++++> Ahhhh!!
Cassie needs to stay at your place. <+++++> What -why?
Seeing some more of your super-cool slides. <+++++> Wow! Really?!
Thanks daddy. <+++++> No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it 's all yours.
Are you really not going? <+++++> I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?
Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk?  Hey, Joey? <+++++> Where 's my ring? My dead grandmother's wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
Yeah, the stripper stole it. <+++++> My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother. <+++++> Well, I'm gonna go get ready,  for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just head.
Oh, that 's better then. <+++++> This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple? <+++++> Just, just, just pick one!
We 're not gonna lose to girls. <+++++> Hey! It 's 42-21!
Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I 'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night. <+++++> No, its Its not that. Umm, now what I'm going to say to you, I'm not saying as your friend. Okay? I 'm-I'm saying as it as Monica's older brother.
Yeah? <+++++> Well y'know  'cause Rachel and I used to go out.
I-I already told him everything!  You shush!! <+++++> Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she 'd made.
Oops! All right, so what do you want to do now? <+++++> I wanna get out of the room! Y'know, I I really miss downstairs.
Okay Ross, we 're-wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession. <+++++> What?
Are you serious?! <+++++> Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours.  It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
I guess. <+++++> Hey, save us some pizza.
I don't have a page. <+++++> Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
Hey! <+++++> Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!
So . <+++++> No.
I know, I know, I'm sorry- <+++++> No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.
It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign. <+++++> How's the hair?
I can 't believe you're not picking me. <+++++> Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!
1200. <+++++> Dollars? You spent $1200 dollars on a plastic bird?
Okay. <+++++> Turn! Turn!
Ross! <+++++> Oh, this is Monica.
All right. . He is a good guy. You're right, he wouldn't cheat. <+++++> Believe me, if I did see with someone, there 's no way I...
Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He 's the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him. <+++++> Okay.
Yeah bye-bye!  Hey! So just a light layer? <+++++> Yes. Yes. Just here  and there .
Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase,  'Hummina-hummina-hummina.' <+++++> That 's excellent.
What?! <+++++> The uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I'm just saying I like it. The hair.
I don 't know. <+++++> Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
I think face to face. <+++++> I would say that.
I'm parked in a garage on Morton! <+++++> They're towing a car. And I am seeing...spots.
Oh, hmm. <+++++> I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn 't quite there. Y'know, I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy
Oo! When 's her birthday?! <+++++> I don 't know Rachel, why?
I don't know, it's just <+++++> Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.
No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play.  When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity.  Thank you! La la la la la la la.... <+++++> Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
Thanks! <+++++> Hi.
Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get? <+++++> You guys.
No! Never! Never!  Bye. <+++++> No touch! No touch!
Score. <+++++> Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties on
Take thee, EM-I-LY <+++++> Take thee,  Emily.  Like there 'd be anybody else.
Who's Nancy? <+++++> What's going on?
Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring? <+++++> Noo!!
No you guys <+++++> I-I-am -
Okay, I 'll just put a little more booze on there. <+++++> I think, subconsciously
Mmh... he does have a pretty serious latex fetish. <+++++> We'll see how dinner goes.
Oh, you are the lesser of two evils! <+++++> YES, YES!
Well, I 'm miserable here! I might as well make some money out it! <+++++> Can I get some of that action?
A scooter! <+++++> Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
Hey guys! <+++++> Hey!
Umm, I-I thought we were moving forward and now you 're-you're sending me all these mixed signals. What are you trying to tell me? <+++++> I 'm trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.
Thank you. Is that one of my cigarettes? <+++++> 
Oh my God! Are you serious?! <+++++> Uh-huh.
Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesn't matter, because I can't do anything about it. <+++++> Why not?
What thing? What is this thing? <+++++> I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel.
Really? <+++++> Really. It's always been you, Rach.
Isn 't that great? <+++++> Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.
Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union of Ross and Emily.  Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross... <+++++> I Ross...
Anytime you're ready. <+++++> Ok, ok, here we go.  Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
Oh wait, don 't you have to pay for your,  Busty Ladies? <+++++> No, it 's okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don't
Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment! <+++++> Actually, it looks really good.
Ross! <+++++> What's that supposed to mean?
May I see it? <+++++> Um, no.
What? <+++++> No, I can 't get it out.
Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please? <+++++> Check again please!
Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty.... <+++++> Petty...
Yes! Did you see that? <+++++> You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
Why? <+++++> This guy could be my baby 's stepfather!
I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded. And there were tall trees all around.  It was dead silent. Gorgeous.  And across the lake I saw a beautiful woman bathing herself but she was crying <+++++> Why?
Chandler. <+++++> Awww, man! Really?
Bye-bye!  That 's why I moved out. <+++++> Hey, y'know while we 're on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don't live here anymore.
Honey, I'm sorry. <+++++> Are you OK?
I meant with my son. <+++++> Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much.
Are you serious?! <+++++> Yeah.
So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we 're 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we've-we've already slept together so y'know there'll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, "What's that?!" <+++++> Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.
I bet 20. <+++++> You're right!
Oh, Chandler that is so nice. <+++++> That is really nice lying! No way is that the reason!
That 's so sweet.  Would you like to come in and say good-bye? I'm sure it would mean a lot to her. <+++++> Oh I don 't know that it would.
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?! <+++++> Hi Frannie, congratulations.
Oh Ross, hi. <+++++> Phoebe, what are you doing?
Ross, she 's not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind. <+++++> Huh. Y 'know what's not one of a kind? A twin!
I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job. <+++++> Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it?
Hi! <+++++> I was gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream.  I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.
Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this? <+++++> 'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there.
You 're still gonna go out with her?! <+++++> Yeah!
What, what are they talking about? <+++++> Rachel?
Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump... <+++++> Yeah, that'll do it.
So you want to come inside? <+++++> Yes. Yes I do.
What kind of smell? <+++++> I don't know. Soap?
Get my glasses too. <+++++> All righty roo.
Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky. <+++++> You know sometimes your words... they hurt.
Hi! Hi! You 're crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight. <+++++> How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!
That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie. <+++++> Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
That is the sweetest thing, I just.... <+++++> You should get some sleep.
Oh. Oh wait no. <+++++> Later.
Rachel. <+++++> Rachel! Well, you-you 're not at home, you're-you're-you're right here.
Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks. <+++++> C'mon, what, you never think about our future?
That 's so great for you guys! <+++++> Yeah!
Wow! <+++++> Rach, come on, I 'm not gonna wear any of this!  Nothing silver. . Ok? Nothing with hair!  And nothing with padlocks on it! .
Yeah, I can see where I 'd be your best shot but, no. I'm sorry, but I think it's twisted. <+++++> Yeah.
If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing. <+++++> Wow.
I'm the hell person whose office this is! <+++++> Good one, Rach.
Art it is. <+++++> 
Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. . . <+++++> Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.
Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can 't get out of! <+++++> Y 'know, maybe she is too young for me. Y'know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby- sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don't know what to do.
Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what? <+++++> Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?
So Ross, are you gonna bring Mona? <+++++> Yeah. Yeah, I think I will.
Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren 't wearing underpants? <+++++> Monica!  Would it?
I did. <+++++> Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
I'm sure he was just joking, Ross. <+++++> If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.
No, Joey! <+++++> Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car
Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder? <+++++> Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder!
Alrighty. We're gonna start with some basic third stage breathing exercises, so Mummies, why don't you get on your back? And... coaches, you should be supporting Mummy's head. <+++++> What? What? What?
Wow. That is not a happy hi. <+++++> Carol's pregnant.
Only if you say his full name. <+++++> 
OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah... <+++++> Oh.. oh... oh.
Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal. <+++++> What?
Yeah I think so. <+++++> I wasn 't talking to you.
I can 't. Please, you do it for me. <+++++> No! Come on let 's-One more time! One final push! Ready? 1 2 3!
It sounds interesting! <+++++> Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett...
I got off the plane. <+++++> You got off the plane.
Hi. <+++++> Mmm.
Now, are you sure you don 't want to go see a doctor? <+++++> Oh no! That-that 'll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y'know what? I'm buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it's in my pocket.
Oh, yeah, I don 't know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house. <+++++> Good morning.
WHAT? <+++++> Wh-what's going on?
Didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs? My fianc e was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner. <+++++> My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. She didn't get any fitter.
Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something.  What?   You slept with someone else?! <+++++> We were on a break!!! Okay!!  We were, we were...,  yeah. Where are you? I 'll find you.
I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children? <+++++> Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...
Oh good! Because we have an  "I'm sorry" song. <+++++> Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
taking a long walk, and then there's the one that's proved most effective <+++++> You 've got to be kidding me!
Is that why your hand is pressed against my crotch? <+++++> That is why!
Alright, Emma is napping...  what happened to your shirt? <+++++> I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.
Yeah, yeah. Phoebe and I are going to have so much fun. And thank you for watching the baby, by the way. <+++++> Oh, it's fine. Actually, I, I invited Mike over.
Yeah? <+++++> Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and..., well...
Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out.. <+++++> I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie!  Hi Joey.  And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend.  I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know.  Come, please come in. Come in.
Now go! <+++++> Thanks a lot.
You go girl. I can't pull that off can I? <+++++> Excuse me, your, your, your wind?
Yeah it is! It is! It 's freshwater eel! <+++++> All right, maybe it means that too
I wish I could know if you 'd heard any of that. I suppose I've either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if you're listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there's not much chance you did heard that, and there's the call waiting so, I should go. Oh well.  Hello. <+++++> Hi.
3-B! <+++++> Oh yeah, aww!
No, the other thing. I really think it 's great they work things out. <+++++> Yeah. There 's no breaking them up, is there?
No. <+++++> Hey umm, was-was Monica here?
What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech? <+++++> No! Do you wanna hear it?
Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound. <+++++> Yeah.
Yes you can! Sting says so himself! <+++++> What?
Dude! He's right there! <+++++> I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
Ok.  Thank you for coming with me today. <+++++> Oh, of course...
That new mountain bike? <+++++> No.
You're right, I apologize. Scratch the last question. Spell "Boscodictiasaur". <+++++> um... I've never heard of a  "Boscodictiasaur".
What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo? <+++++> Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
I don 't know. <+++++> Yeah, yeah.  It wasn 't every morning.
Oh good. <+++++> Look, I  Look, I 'm having a great time with you and I just don't want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So, I'm sorry I just don't think we should go away together yet. It's-it's too soon.
Yeah. <+++++> Oh, okay.
What, what!? it's for her hot friends! <+++++> When they see this you'll be 52!
I don 't want to talk about it. <+++++> Okay, umm
Six. <+++++> Challenge extended.
Could we see something in a slimmer heel? <+++++> Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.
Hi. <+++++> Hey.
Phoebe. <+++++> Sweetie, now I pick you.
Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer. <+++++> So umm, where are the other guys?
Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you. <+++++> Hello? Hi.
Just one cheek. <+++++> Nuh, uh, the moment's gone.
HI! <+++++> Hey!
Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don 't see that everyday, do ya? <+++++> Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What 's with the tackling?
Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with. <+++++> Doctor Burke is sexy?
That's because I'm pregnant! <+++++> Right, no, I understand.
What? <+++++> You keep, you keep... You can't...
Uh-huh, yeah that 's too bad. I really want to go to his concert Friday night, but it's totally sold out. I know! Why don't you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two I'll take you. <+++++> Well actually, I 'm picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he'll be there.
I'm telling ya...  I can do it. <+++++> Yeah, he can do it!
I can 't do that either! The soles' are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood. <+++++> Hey!
And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn 't wear a cup. <+++++> Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!
That 's like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that! <+++++> Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, here 's what happened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and a half ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing.
I set her up with this actor on my show. <+++++> You set her up?!
Ok. <+++++> Ready sweety?
Really? <+++++> Absolutely.  I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really,  I'm fine. I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. I mean, at first I was like..  But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this.
Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you? <+++++> Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.
She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place. <+++++> Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?
Are you sure? <+++++> No.
From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...' <+++++> ...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
It's uh, $12.50. <+++++> Okay,  so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh, wood-burning ovens?
Word on the street - well, when I say street, I mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo. <+++++> Of course.
You, you are gonna love this. <+++++> Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here.
Y 'know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed? <+++++> Okay. Sure.
Alright! <+++++> Ni-chou chi-ma!
Yes. <+++++> Sit down.
Ross, you're mayor of the zone. <+++++> I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...
It's great. You're gonna be the hit of the conference. <+++++> Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. .
Fine, I will. <+++++> Good, 'cause I love you.
You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me? <+++++> No, no, they will. I just... uh...
Yes! <+++++> Am I?!
Oh my God!  I'm your groupie! <+++++> I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
Yeah!! <+++++> It 's not like we don't know how to party!!
See? I've even called Animal Control! <+++++> You called Animal Control?
Well, I can't help you. <+++++> Well, whatever it is I'm-I'm very, very sorry. Okay?
No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die. <+++++> Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.
You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work! <+++++> Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.
That 's not so good. <+++++> No-no it 's not. What-what happened there Ned?
We are on a roll, people!! <+++++> Come on!!
Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really I don't mind. <+++++> Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
Hey, mister tux! <+++++> Why aren't you guys dressed?
Okay, I 'll see you in our room. <+++++> Yeah.
Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it. <+++++> Gimme this.
Fear of Triscuts? <+++++> It 's possible, they have really sharp edges.
All right, all right. <+++++> What is that?
Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I 'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy. But, I don't know, I'm not to worried about it. <+++++> Well you shouldn 't be. Believe me I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you.  I mean that doofus is going to lose!
Was that place... The Sun? <+++++> Oh! And it gets worse!
You know?! <+++++> What?
No don't worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally over Eric. <+++++> . Good choice Ross.
No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay? <+++++> So uh, what did you tell them about me?
Hi, darling. Where's my grandson, you didn't bring him? <+++++> No, he's at uh, Carol's and Susan's today.
Hey. <+++++> Hey.
Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago! <+++++> 3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ...
Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross. <+++++> Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
Yeah, I <+++++> But now! I 'm there! I'm totally there! I'm-I'm finally where you are!
Oh, I love your neighborhood. There 's a great gym right around the corner from your building. <+++++> That 's my gym.
Please tell me you 're not gonna dress up like a dinosaur. <+++++> Not two years in a row.
Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses. <+++++> Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools.
I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket. <+++++> So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?
Excuse me? <+++++> Come on Rach, you can 't even eat alone in a restaurant.
Let me try it on! <+++++> Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin ' in there.
I'm just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you. <+++++> Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We're not 13 anymore.
Well it stupid, unfair question! <+++++> Don 't blame the questions!
Yes, please. <+++++> Well, oh, I 'm sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?
Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon! <+++++> And the place looks so nice!
Are you crazy? <+++++> Are you out of your mind?
Hey <+++++> I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y 'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so
Could you do me one favor, if it 's not too much trouble? <+++++> Yeah, Sarah, anything.
You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you. <+++++> That's easy for you to say, you found one already.
Really?! <+++++> No, a car backfired, but  I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
You really enjoyed yourself didn 't you? <+++++> Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose -I mean I-I'm not proud of it but, I really am. And it's all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
Okay, our news. My company has asked me to head up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated. <+++++> Oh my God!
I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars. <+++++> I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.
Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross. <+++++> Hi.
What? <+++++> I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...
Hey guys! <+++++> The chocolates aren't here yet.
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel? <+++++> Dude, you are sick.
She is unbelievable, our mother is... <+++++> Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
Who 's cell phone is that? It's just so annoying; everywhere you go. <+++++> I think it 's coming from your bag.
Well, up yours too! <+++++> What?! No! No! That 's-that's time-out!
Ok, Ross, what's going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now? <+++++> I don't know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?
Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I 'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that... <+++++> No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I 'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore.
Uhh, 11! <+++++> 11, unbelievable, 11 is correct.
I'm sorry, I didn't get... Susan is? <+++++> Susan is Carol's, Carol's, Carol's, friend...
What 's going on? <+++++> I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.
That sounds great. <+++++> Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines.
Surprised? <+++++> And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um I didn't propose to you.
No, I 'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him. <+++++> Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
Oh my God! <+++++> Nooooo!
see I can't decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table. <+++++> Wow! I didn 't know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
Good luck. <+++++> 
Could you tell Jasmine that I won't make it to yoga class today? <+++++> Sure.
We agreed on Minnie. <+++++> 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?
I'm not scared.  I'll just take little Chappy and...  HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED. <+++++> Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then. Ha haaa...  He stinks!
Where've you been? <+++++> At the vet.
Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores.  You know, we as a group are not the coolest. <+++++> I don't think they saw us.
I can too eat by myself! <+++++> When have you ever?
Yeah, thanks. You know what? <+++++> What?
Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care. <+++++> Multiple orgasms!
Hey! Oh! <+++++> You 're not getting away this time mister! Unless you want that ass kicking we talked about!
What's so bad about that? <+++++> It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.
Chicken Kiev? <+++++> Um-hmm! Doesn 't that sound delicious at the last minute?
That 's my car! <+++++> A  '95 LeSabre?!
Hi! <+++++> Pheebs, what's wrong?
Yeah. <+++++> What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person who 's going to enjoy these bad boys  is me.
OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you. <+++++> No, you, ya know there's no need to make it u. . . how?
Yeah! <+++++> Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice!
Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it. <+++++> No, I don 't want to hit you.
Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh? <+++++> Not yet.
That's so sweet. <+++++> And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
Really? <+++++> But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster
Hey! The law says you have to accept any fare. <+++++> No, you don't understand. This isn't a real cab.
I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet? <+++++> I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.
No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special. <+++++> That may be the most depressing thing I 've heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer's office.
Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I 'd be serving him sneezers. <+++++> So?
Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything. <+++++> You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm. <+++++> So...
I just finished getting Phoebe all dressed to meet Mike's parents. She's so nervous, it's so sweet! <+++++> Guess what? I made Emma laugh today.
I think on some levels she already knows. <+++++> Phoebe, she doesn 't know that you sneak out every night, she doesn't know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn't know that you've been living with your Grandmother's for a week now.
I'm not supposed to tell you. <+++++> I'm not supposed to tell you!
Because I 'm in love with you. <+++++> What?!
Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out <+++++> Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger!  I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like,  "Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!"  I kinda scared myself.
Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! . I mean, this is just beautiful! <+++++> Wow, this is really soft . Three hundred and fifty dollars?
Veto. Sawyer? <+++++> Veto. Helen?
Give us a kiss. Come on! Come on! <+++++> Why?! Why on the lips?!
Oh... I'm back! <+++++> Ok!... Uh... excuse me? Yeah?
Hey. <+++++> Hey!
Okay, you 'd tell me the truth. Right? <+++++> Rach, you can 't look fat in an x-ray.
Well, I 'm going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um...... <+++++> Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.
I don 't know, but we're having dinner tomorrow night, so I figured, she's gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to, buy me presents, I don't know! So, you're all bored? <+++++> Ohh!!
Santa has reindeers that can fly! <+++++> Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
Bye. <+++++> Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!
Really?! Well see? I never knew about her. <+++++> Linda Clickclocken.  So what uh, what-what table are you at?  Oh, uh me too.
That is so unfair! <+++++> Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!
You know, I had a chance to stop her too! <+++++> Yeah?
I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach? <+++++> Yeah! Yeah, we can!
You know the song! Sing along! <+++++> So?
Thank you! I know, though. <+++++> You see this, this is a person who is ready to go. Phoebe you, oh, you are my star.
Ross! <+++++> I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! What do I have to do to get some service?!  Hi Rach.
No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front.  So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard. <+++++> That is so unfair!
Sit down! <+++++> Okay.
Ah! <+++++> Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel?
But y 'know what? It just seems that you two belong together. <+++++> Okay, stop it! I can 't deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby.
He does that?! <+++++> Uh, I don 't know, whatever.
That-that you came on to me? <+++++> There 's the one!
Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I 'm never gonna find anything. <+++++> You can live with me.
Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it 's better if we're on the same team. <+++++> Right. Okay, let 's play. Let's go.
How is  "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate? <+++++> How 's Monica coming along with her vows?
Really? <+++++> Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we 're gonna give her some! Okay, grab grab some empty boxes. Okay? We'll-we'll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we'll-we'll put 'em in their.
I 'm Rhonda,  and these aren't real! <+++++> Wow, Rhonda.
Oh! That's great! <+++++> Yeah!
Dude, what are you massaging an old man for? <+++++> His daughter was hot.
Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don 't want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking, "Ah, I'll get over this." Y'know? I just-It just keeps gettin' harder. I don't, I don't know what to do. Y'know? What do I do? <+++++> I think you need to tell her how you feel.
You 've have lipstick right here . That's okay, it's mine, we just kissed. <+++++> Oh.
I couldn 't help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look! (He goes to punch Ross, expecting him to duck, but he doesn't and Joey punches Ross. <+++++> What is the matter with you?!?
I don 't wanna hear "Three failed marriages!" <+++++> Look, if you 'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand!
You've never turned? <+++++> No, I barely even got to three Mississippi.
Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that 's he's going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff. <+++++> And what are you going to do for him?
Hey! <+++++> Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?
Fine with me. <+++++> Okay, y'know what, let 's just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?
Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again! <+++++> Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
But the audition 's in a couple hours and I don't even understand the game. <+++++> Well do you want some help?
Of course they're gonna say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity. It's all a great big cover-up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes? <+++++> That guy Lipson?
Come on. I'll let you lead. <+++++> Ok.
Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play? <+++++> No, women are welcome to play.
Fine. Fine, but I 'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want! <+++++> No that 's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I
Wait, what am I gonna do? <+++++> You, you go long.
Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding! <+++++> Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.
It 's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck! <+++++> Yeah, yeah you have the ring?
Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya. <+++++> There's an image.
So? What? What? They 're gone! Monica's gonna freak! <+++++> Well, I 'm sure they're still somewhere here in the hotel. I'll-I'll help you look for them.
Really? <+++++> Ross, wants a pajmena?
Peter Parker. <+++++> Thank you.
Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead. <+++++> Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldn 't be the worst thing in the world. <+++++> Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life.
Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather. <+++++> You're not his godfather.
I-I think everybody 's pretending they don't hear you. Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it!  Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I saved you seat. <+++++> That 's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey.
Hey. <+++++> Hey.
Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle. <+++++> Huh?
It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost- cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell. <+++++> There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.
Other wall, people! Other wall! <+++++> Rach, you there?
Hey! <+++++> I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.
Yeah? <+++++> Geez! Are you ready?
Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married! <+++++> Oh my God!!
You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser? <+++++> You were my first kiss with Rachel?
Mine! <+++++> All right. Uhh, international.
Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught me Hot- cross Buns. <+++++> Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.
So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet? <+++++> Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay -and F.Y.I she must've shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was, "I don't give a tiny rat's ass."
Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal. <+++++> Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
I can 't remember which sister. <+++++> You see what men do! Don 't tell me men are not nice!  This is men!!
Alright. Just keep him away from me. <+++++> Thank you.  C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling?  Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy! <+++++> You can see where he'd have trouble.
Hey! <+++++> Hey...

Oh, okay. Alright, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8 <+++++> Yes, that's what I have. It's not on the board.
Yes? <+++++> Hi. I 'm Ross Geller. I live in the building.
I think it makes you look really dangerous. <+++++> Oh, I know. Y 'know what, I never would've gotten this if it weren't for you. No really, when I'm with you I'm-I'm like this whole other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love that guy!
Gimme an  'M!' <+++++> M!
Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking. <+++++> What?! What?! Talking about what?!
Wow. Umm Huh I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now. <+++++> What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
There's no room under the bed. <+++++> Is everything okay?
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
What?! All right -Hey! Don't look at me! You're the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet! <+++++> It 's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay?  Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
What are you talking about Pheebs?  I don't   Oh my God, you drew on me?! <+++++> Hey, you wet my pants!

Uh, that 's okay. You can dance with her first. <+++++> Oh, you-you sure?  Okay.  Okay. So what 's uh, what's your name.
Oh, hey, man I know, doesn 't matter how much we love 'em, monogamy is too cruel a rule. <+++++> Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don 't need that kind've hurt. Take it from a guy who's never had a long term relationship...... <+++++> I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!
Mmmm! <+++++> I- I think they're great! I, I really do.
Okay that 's it. I give up. At mom and dad's 40th anniversary, you're the one giving the speech. <+++++> Y 'know I don't understand why they didn't cry. It was a beautiful speech.
Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside. <+++++> Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died.
You are so sweet. <+++++> That 's, that's, that's a big candy bar.  I had the most amazing time with you.

Whoa!! <+++++> Whoa, sorry Tommy.
Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that. <+++++> Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?
Just keep smiling. <+++++> Okay.
Hey. <+++++> I found a note on my door,  "Come to Monica's quick, bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar. "
All right! <+++++> Well, what about me?! I 'm a medical marvel!!
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it. <+++++> Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Yeah, the list that -of people we're allowed to sleep <+++++> Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know I 'm looking for him?
Don 't be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y'know? Mine's gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive. <+++++> Look, all I know is I-I can 't have another failed marriage!
Okay. Have a benefit. <+++++> Hey!
All right. <+++++> Go.
You didn 't just break up. <+++++> Hey, it 's been like three weeks!

Professor Geller? <+++++> Oh, damn it!
Did I say garage? I meant garbage. <+++++> Y 'know what? Maybe, Mrs. Green, it's not absolutely vital that you live with us.
By the way, that fight was totally arousing. <+++++> Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.
Dude, don't do that too me! <+++++> All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
Oh no. <+++++> Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it.

What?! <+++++> You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!
Limited seating?!  I am just one tiny person! <+++++> Well yeah, but she doesn 't know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
I'm not going along with some lie you made Ross, No I'm just gonna be honest with him. <+++++> Good yeah just be honest with him.
Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh, maybe going back to my place for um, dessert. <+++++> Humm, that sounds, I don't, perfect.
Help! <+++++> I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back.  Ow.

Sting has a son that goes there too! <+++++> Yeah I know; he 's in Ben's class.
Okay,  fine. Come dinosaur, we 're not welcome in the house of no imagination. <+++++> Uh, Pheebs, while we 're hovering around the subject. I just have to say dinosaurs, they-they don't go, rrroof!

That's like the worst of the Chesters. <+++++> You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good.
Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one 's free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free. <+++++> Laugh it up, but the joke 's on you. Because we don't need to get divorced, okay? We we're just gonna get an annulment.
Oh man! <+++++> Hey!
Why not?! <+++++> I-I-I don 't even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y'know what? I'm just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh? <+++++> You put an offer on a house?
HI!! Hi! <+++++> What?! What?!

No. <+++++> You are, you're welling up.
I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes. <+++++> Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.
Wellll? <+++++> Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Ah-haah! I win!! <+++++> What is that?
This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it? <+++++> You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.
No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people still die. And, you can put candy in it. <+++++> Hey!
Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors! <+++++> How about we settle this right now!  There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!

Wait, are you leaving? <+++++> Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by  "bye!"
Faster! You 're not going fast enough! <+++++> Maybe I should stand on your feet!
A sandwich? <+++++> Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here
Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water. <+++++> Seriously that's a lot of cups.
Yes. <+++++> I hate that guy.
Did you get the grant? <+++++> No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.
