Let's go have dinner, shall we? <+++++> Mmm.
I wasn't and you know it and don't push it- just listen- we have a problem in Tsavo- <+++++> -at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
Come on, George, let's hurry. <+++++> Did you get a doctor?
Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now? <+++++> All those people...
Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil? Are you God? <+++++> No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling...
What don't you know? <+++++> This is a lot of information to be getting... I have to think --
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me. <+++++> No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
Is it? <+++++> If you only knew...
First visit to London? <+++++> No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
Made just for you, Cookie. <+++++> How about some steak sauce?
Don't tell me that. I don't want to know that. <+++++> She's incredible. Everything just gets soaked.
He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia? <+++++> One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
Exactly. <+++++> Nightmare.
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you -- <+++++> No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
I found a broken gasket, from space -- <+++++> A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right? <+++++> No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
Nothing. Okay. Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but... <+++++> Tell me.
The hell does she want? <+++++> I don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over.
What about it? <+++++> Maybe we should split it up now.
Nah... scotch. <+++++> Far out. Single malt? Can I pick it?
Let's go. <+++++> Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
This is insane. <+++++> There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
Earl... it's me, Valiant. <+++++> Eddie? Jesus, what happened?
Thanks. <+++++> So, this is what you do? I mean when you're not playing other parts?
Forty-six. <+++++> Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Because I don't love him. <+++++> But that is no reason to get a divorce!
We don't wash 'em, ya know. <+++++> How about chargin' the battery?
Jesus Christ, Castor. <+++++> Drive.
Aye, he looks a right lurker. <+++++> You're undressed. Where are your clothes?
Ten. Waiting for you to come find me. <+++++> Why didn't you say something?
Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0. We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station. <+++++> COUGAR, THIS IS MAVERICK. I'M GETTING HUNGRY, LET'S HEAD FOR THE BARN. ...COUGAR, WHERE ARE YOU?
I checked the place out. There weren't no dicks in there. <+++++> You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp. I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
From you? <+++++> From my father and Nolan.
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for? <+++++> Who?
I say a lot of things. <+++++> And like a fool I believe it.
So what's up with you and DeLa? <+++++> What do you mean?
Lots of people have guns. You're American. Americans love guns. <+++++> I fought my way out of an embassy.
Who'd steal her body? <+++++> That's what they're going to ask you.
Yeah! <+++++> What did you guys think?
No, I don't want to be rude. <+++++> Well, then, sit down.
He just got Hip to us. He just ended the War. <+++++> What are we gonna <u>do</u> about it...?
You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off. <+++++> What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
 <+++++> Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays. <+++++> Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
No. <+++++> Amsterdam?
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything. <+++++> Okay, cool.
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you. <+++++> Don't hurt yourself. I'm going to Big Choice Video instead.
I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras. We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion. <+++++> Gimme a break! Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!
Still happy you married me? <+++++> MMmmm.
The pepper, too? <+++++> No, thank you.
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle... <+++++> Selina Kyle...lovely person.
Have you ever shot a man? How many times have you been primary through the door? <+++++> I have to qualify, is that it?
Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company... <+++++> Not too quickly.
Please -- just let me sleep. <+++++> You can't sleep. Come on, Fran -- open your eyes. Let's get her walking.
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote. <+++++> Yeah, but he was successful.
How are you? <+++++> I'm just fine, Ally. What about you?
How did you know...? <+++++> There's a reward for your death.
I'm sorry, Tommy. <+++++> Have you got any gear on you?
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together. <+++++> But what's gotten into you?... We would have known.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy. <+++++> Yeah.
You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what? You can't even say it, can you? <+++++> Say what?
I told you I'm looking for someone. <+++++> In the cars, too? !
I hear she does more than talk with her mouth. <+++++> That's disgusting!
What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on? <+++++> If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
There goes your ride. <+++++> Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
But if he knew we have so little time - <+++++> If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up.
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime. <+++++> Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation.
We could move 'em up here. <+++++> He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything.
You don't know the procedure. <+++++> I know him.
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf? <+++++> No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me? Ask him if he's accusing me!
What? <+++++> To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns. <+++++> You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
I suggested a rather unbelievable explanation. Since then, I've come to believe, that my explanation, however unbelievable, is in fact, true. <+++++> And what was that explanation?
I've made you silk pajamas. Do you want to change into them? <+++++> Put them down.
Yes. <+++++> Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
You're not going after Argon! <+++++> I have to!
It has no nobility. <+++++> Well, these are slum kids, I was a slum kid, everybody talks like that.
Let that be our problem, just get us there. <+++++> You follow.
Why? Nobody knows who we are. <+++++> Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?!
Of course. <+++++> Anybody we know?
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out. <+++++> Maybe I did... I don't remember.
Thank you. <+++++> Goodbye, Hanna.
Gimme three. <+++++> At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow. <+++++> How'd I know it was for you?
It? <+++++> It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him?
It's as if we were glued to the spot. <+++++> You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I happen to know he was out on a case. <+++++> I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter -- this is a respectable house, not a honky-tonky. Come on, Oscar.
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel. <+++++> That's ironic. Because we're here to protect her from you.
He knows everything. <+++++> Don't you want me to stay?
Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable. <+++++> It was the only way to solve certain problems --
Don't you think I feel lousy about this too? <+++++> All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it. I don't think I got one hour's sleep the whole night.
He's a good student. <+++++> We were worried that Ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball--we're so pleased, he met a Christian woman.
No. What are you gonna do? <+++++> Make dat money. Get paid.
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing. <+++++> No, I don't.
You Scots have a way with game. It still has life in it. Spirit. Back home the food is so...domestic. <+++++> Why are you here?
You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to --  marriage license! Did you say -- ? <+++++> I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath. <+++++> 
Greenpeace. <+++++> Greenpeace?
Yes, he is. He raises corn. <+++++> Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
Stop asking everyone. <+++++> Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
Hi there. <+++++> Is that your car?
...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me? I think you should be, you know that. <+++++> Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
What? ? <+++++> That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.
Anything you can tell me? <+++++> The criminals are winning.
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of. <+++++> Well, I don't notice us hustling trash, either.
You don't call, you don't write. <+++++> This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
What do they say? <+++++> They're practically all the same, sir.
Six months, maybe five, five or six months...do you wanna check that? <+++++> Are you guys hurt?
Gentlemen, let me get to the point, I can't see the wisdom of pursuing this old court-martial against General Arnold. <+++++> The man is a traitor!
How's business, Bruce? <+++++> Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
He married you, didn't he? <+++++> He was in love with me.
...it. <+++++> Darlene, it's five-thirty. Now, I worked late for you this mornin', and you didn't wanna spring for over-...
Y'all mind the store. <+++++> Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
It's a miracle she's not dead! <+++++> We have to do something before she tries it again!
My legacy. <+++++> Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
Because I love you... <+++++> Then it's not too late for us...
No! A horror movie star! <+++++> Boris Karloff! ?
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards. <+++++> You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
I know that. <+++++> Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything? <+++++> Some money.
Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know. <+++++> But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance. <+++++> Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
Right after he retires from the majors. We just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday. <+++++> Yeah...I remember. I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
I see it Chewie, hang on. <+++++> The entrance is collapsing!
That's proper, sir, according to the code. <+++++> By the powers, you're right! Where's Jack's pistol? Who's got it? Bring it forward!
Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then. <+++++> Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
Simple? Kill him? How? <+++++> That's your business... I don't care how.
Who? <+++++> Jack.
I am big. It's the pictures that got small. <+++++> I knew there was something wrong with them.
How much do I owe you? <+++++> One night on the town.
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here? <+++++> He's asleep. We were up very late.
I didn't see you there. Can I help you? <+++++> My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom! <+++++> Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk. <+++++> I'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day.
Okay...  Night, baby. <+++++> George?
Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late. <+++++> You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
Sorry to wake you. <+++++> I wasn't sleeping. You OK?
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man. <+++++> What should I do?
You would not...? <+++++> No.
Get out of here! <+++++> No, you get out of here.
You got any books in there? <+++++> Oh come on.
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered. <+++++> Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.
... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me. <+++++> Did you meet Captain Kirk?
Do you remember what just happened? <+++++> Yes.
Did you find anything at Dana's? <+++++> Nothing. Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub. But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.
You're a fucking alarm clock. <+++++> I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
Me. <+++++> Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before. That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
For a fee. <+++++> I never use mine. But it's a good thing to have. Just as a threat.
That's a lot of talk. A whole lot of talk. <+++++> Damn it, Jake. If I don't get out of here some guys are going to come gunning for me.
Cannon fodder. <+++++> Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor? I don't get it.
How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part? <+++++> Last time I didn't.
Yeah, but-- <+++++> Am I wrong! ?
Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers. <+++++> Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this? <+++++> Me and Sounder went to this prison camp to see my Daddy and the police guard runs us away and I fell on some glass.
Yes. Frank-- <+++++> Frank is coming?
You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain. <+++++> I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
You want to pay me? <+++++> Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
I've heard of Sugai. I've also heard of the emperor. They're both national treasures. One's a hood. <+++++> I need someone to translate for me.
You're trying to save Sparazza? <+++++> No... We're trying to save Heller.
You his wife? <+++++> Yes.
Do you know where he got the dumper? <+++++> He never told me.
Something personal. Is he bothering you? <+++++> I don't know. I'd like to know where he is.
If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it. <+++++> Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there. Ask Pimm.
Sidearms? But the saucer's dead. <+++++> We hope!
How did he get over there? <+++++> Easy! Walked right through the gate, past the guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal.
Awwww, buddy -- <+++++> And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart. <+++++> I don't need any new ties. I've got another tie - I've got another one besides this one.
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store. <+++++> I'm not dealing.
Yes. It's you Leia. <+++++> I know. Somehow...I've always known.
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little. <+++++> Holy shit, I'm a freak.
Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on. <+++++> I really donÂt like that comparison, honey.
Good. So shall we leave it at that then? <+++++> I dunno.
... you want to be Margo's new understudy. <+++++> 
It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance. <+++++> Romance!
Bonjour Monsieur Philipe. <+++++> You are very pretty. I would like to kiss you.
...Darlene pay you in cash? <+++++> Since today. New policy.
How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet? <+++++> It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger. Not their grief. <+++++> Who did they get for that?
Sure you can, just-- <+++++> He needs me here.
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness. <+++++> Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
Nothing. Calling to say hi... What's up with you? <+++++> Bored.
We-are-mobilizing-to-defend-<u>her</u>. <+++++> Can we give'er a <u>kitten</u>?
We'll split up the week. You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and -- <+++++> You take tuberculosis. My smoking doesn't go over at all.
That's what you tell me. <+++++> What have you heard?
Okay. yeah, call. <+++++> Look. it can wait till Sunday.
There's no one left ... <+++++> We've got several Italian cars on the list. Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So we're gonna need a specialist ...
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward. <+++++> Yes, I presumed it was about him.
How so? <+++++> Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
Hey... ! <+++++> Little more juice's all it needs...
What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you? <+++++> Naw.
How can you say that? Especially after today? <+++++> Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind. There's no winning and losing here.
No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place. <+++++> Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
...tunnel now! <+++++> Just go check the temperature.
That's your name, isn't it? <+++++> You always call me Miss Brewster.
Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party. <+++++> What makes you think we're more interesting?
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit. I'm cooking it. <+++++> That's a different dress.
What happened? <+++++> 
What happened, Major? Some kind of private beef between the two of you? <+++++> Look, I didn't shoot him!
Yeah? What happened? <+++++> Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
Now that'd be a misdemeanor. <+++++> I got to get going. An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary. <+++++> He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
Fucking Germans. Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis. <+++++> They were Nazis, Dude?
Please, I have the perfect excuse. <+++++> What about rehearsal?
Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie. <+++++> Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief. He must've taken it from the statue. <+++++> Taken what?
I'm going to kill him myself! <+++++> What about the money?
What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?! ! <+++++> Your accident...
I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid. It was on TV. <+++++> Shh -- don't talk. Hold still.
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose. <+++++> What are you saying, that it's time to go?
I thought he was a lame. <+++++> A lame ?
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw? <+++++> I'm staying with the Countess.
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard. <+++++> Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like? <+++++> Come on in.
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this... <+++++> You have the wrong feeling.
...you did it. <+++++> No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
Where did you see that? <+++++> It's classified.
She said "If they get me". They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason. <+++++> So the guy's not a sicko.
He's an enemy soldier. <+++++> I'm not going to let you kill him.
Oh, I know he does. <+++++> He's told you?
Icky! <+++++> Get him, Daniel! Knock his block off!
You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you? Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind. <+++++> I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'.
What are you scared of? <+++++> Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
That can't be...that's not gonna happen. <+++++> It did, Pop. It did.
-- I work for the city. <+++++> You knew what we were asking you to do. Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now. The fit isn't right.
No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast. <+++++> Who is...
Yes? <+++++> Be careful.
He could? <+++++> His company made us.
What do you want to know? <+++++> You broke into the bar. You wanted to get your money. You and Marty had a fight. Something happened...
It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage. <+++++> You don't know anything about me!
Naturally. <+++++> Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out -- I finally talked her into it --
What if youÂ¹re wrong? ? <+++++> Then IÂ¹ve been a very bad boy and youÂ¹ll have to spank me. Christ! IÂ¹m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!
[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?] <+++++> [One-one-three Arco Iris. Third floor.]
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say. <+++++> What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
The end. <+++++> No, not the end. The beginning.
Not right now, Jerry. <+++++> Do I know everything there is to know here? You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
All right, you two, move along. <+++++> Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie. <+++++> No. They just try to hold you for ransom. Fuck you, Moses! I'm outa here!
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman? <+++++> Yeah.
Women is always tar'd. <+++++> You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
I'm sorry, Walter. <+++++> Don't be sorry for me. I did those things. No one else did. I'm dealing with that.
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure. <+++++> He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
Yes... <+++++> Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling. Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man? <+++++> Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.
We'd only just met. <+++++> Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
Jackie? <+++++> Hi, Melanie.
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I... <+++++> I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
What are <u>you</u> looking at? <+++++> I don't know.
In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either. So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality? <+++++> I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
You know ...  ... whoops! <+++++> Mother!
May as well go out under my own free will, right? <+++++> Not with us in the fuckin' car!
Very happily married. <+++++> Same here.
He lives with his mother. <+++++> And he had a younger brother who... was... a...
It's on me. <+++++> You won't get off that cheap.
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort. I thought they might cure her. <+++++> You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life. There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity. Why did you do it?
There. <+++++> Behind the rabbit?
Meanwhile...? <+++++> Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.
Unfortunately, no. <+++++> Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me...
I drug in a cot, if you want to stay. <+++++> Well now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you something for your own good, only first gimme a cigarette.
-- Merely in the interests of order. <+++++> The formality of a trial would be too costly for them. They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support.
...Our original sponsor had no stomach for military applications. he cut the funding for our work - <+++++> Our work?
How long will they watch us for? <+++++> Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
...how do we Explain That? Hey? Am I worried...? <+++++> ...how do we explain that? With the World Watching.
What? <+++++> Well, I've been doing some thinking.
Luke, you run again and we'll kill you. <+++++> I know, I know. Just don't hit me.
Hello, Benjamin. <+++++> Who's Benjamin?
Somebody told you. <+++++> Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine.
No. But I'll have a sofa brought out to you. Good enough? <+++++> Good enough. And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
What? <+++++> You understand what's going on? It makes sense, right?
Who's here! ? <+++++> The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!
We have to have a plan. <+++++> What sort of plan?
And what about the guy that was following me? <+++++> Now you're really getting paranoid.
I know it. <+++++> I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
How much was the original loan again? <+++++> $500. He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000.
Still alive. Hmm. I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno. <+++++> He had a pressing engagement.
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em. <+++++> They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years.
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from... <+++++> He's worse than an animal. Jail's too good for scum like that.
No, sir. <+++++> Then why bother me with this nonsense? Get in touch with the base commander.
So?... <+++++> So, he's not my type. Let me walk you to the elevator.
No. <+++++> Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off. <+++++> Women's intuition. Are there anymore?
It's about my salary cheques. <+++++> Yes?
When I come back in the morning, I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say? <+++++> ain't got a hatÂ
Worried about what all your girlfriends might think? <+++++> Frida, you know you're it for me.
I did keep an eye... <+++++> Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
What else did he get? <+++++> Wallet, cash, I.D...
Why you? <+++++> I was at hand.
Who's your partner? <+++++> I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me. <+++++> Where is she? Where is the girl?
You know the story, same thing here. Same principle, I mean. <+++++> So what's wrong with her?
Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become -- <+++++> In aid of what?
I mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons. <+++++> You're still eight pounds over. What's the reason for this?
I like your style, master. How do we get him here? <+++++> There's only one way.
It was her wrist. And it was through a plate-glass door. <+++++> Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue. Maybe she'll stay this time.
That happens, you'll get it back. <+++++> Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common.
And splittin' with her? <+++++> I'm sure that was the idea.
Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal! <+++++> Thank you.
After all your posturing, all your speeches...you're nothing but a common thief. <+++++> I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane. And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite.
I think so. One right, two lefts... <+++++> And a right.
How'd they take it back at headquarters? <+++++> Usual bullshit. You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks.
I won't let my motha cut my hair. <+++++> Wha'?
Get Steve back his job...please... <+++++> He means that much to you...?
You say... <+++++> The River!
Never saw him before in my life. Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do. <+++++> You do know me. You helped me once.
I have some friends who have had a accident-- <+++++> You have somebody else out there?
Done up in little ribbons. I could die right now and nobody'd be confused. How about you, Max? <+++++> How about me what?
The kid is amazing. <+++++> No. A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
Who? <+++++> Dave.
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say. <+++++> Tonight's the night.
Help someone! <+++++> Oh God! Help!
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay. <+++++> Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS! <+++++> Say it a little louder. I don't think Bela heard you in his trailer.
It doesn't have to be <+++++> And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable. <+++++> I'll tell you one thing though.
First you gotta tell me something. <+++++> No--
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one. <+++++> If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo. <+++++> The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
What. <+++++> You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
Yes he is. <+++++> Well, I need to speak to him.
I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss. <+++++> Llewelyn Moss?
Ricky's taken care of. <+++++> How so?
Well what? <+++++> What do you think?
And you grew up in Manhattan? <+++++> Kinda. Yeah.
Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm <u>still</u> in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis? <+++++> At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it.
What the hell are you talking about? <+++++> Us...I'm talking about us... We're the fish.
I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books. <+++++> Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.
You know what she asked me? <+++++> I don't care what she asked you.
Agreed. You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune -- <+++++> Will -- you can't trust him.
I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something. <+++++> I can understand that -- after your -- uh --
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! <+++++> An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock.
Our expenses? <+++++> Uh huh.
You know you can get places in the world with pudding. That's funny. <+++++> Yeah.
It was different then. <+++++> My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest. <+++++> I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one.
Satisfy yourself it's there. Then we do it one last time. The final exchange. And we go our separate ways. <+++++> And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
Is that true? <+++++> That's true.
Of course they did. <+++++> Let the buyer beware.
Tell me about it... <+++++> You too?
I sure know what that feels like. <+++++> And all the plans we have.
Yeah, if it opens the door. <+++++> Yeah.
What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her? <+++++> It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
He should. <+++++> This Janiro's a good fighter, pretty good-lookin' kid.
Andy? Andy is that you? <+++++> Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence -
Hal. Lives in New York near his mom. <+++++> How did you meet her?
What do you mean "bad?" <+++++> It's hard to explain, but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension.
You mean, before she sank. <+++++> Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
Stop. You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that. <+++++> Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds. <+++++> All the little kids arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone.
Who's coming for me? <+++++> Stand up and see for yourself.
Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen... <+++++> Here.
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room. <+++++> In the room?
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting. <+++++> You'd be surprised.
I didn't say that. Why would I say that? <+++++> Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her. <+++++> Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
Then you knew of the inheritance? <+++++> Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise.
Yeah. <+++++> Well, shit! Happy fucking birthday!
He did? When? <+++++> While you were in the shower.
Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way. And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means. <+++++> What are you going to do?
But God, people can be rude. Feel like I have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my... <+++++> Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.
It's true. Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much. <+++++> I pay you too much.
DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night! <+++++> We went to a hotel.
Kill them both. <+++++> Here?
But do you stand for anything? <+++++> Yes, I stand for -
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie. We miss you in Toontown. <+++++> Wish I could say the same. What're you doin' here, Betty?
What's happening up here? <+++++> I think it's fizzled out.
What do you think? <+++++> I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...
It's dark. <+++++> Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
Just the paper. <+++++> Thirty-fire.
No. I have to go in. I live here. <+++++> Right. I'll come in.
No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us. <+++++> How do they do that?
I hope they fucking fry us all. <+++++> Yeah. French fries...
Cocktail? <+++++> <u>No</u>!! What's with digging the holes?
I thought I would need it. <+++++> And why, please tell us, would you think that?
Who's Principal Collins? <+++++> The principal.
uh - then he - be just - <+++++> He just went out like & light-
But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast. <+++++> You got it.
I can't possibly think of a better reason. <+++++> It's false sentimentality.
I want to ride my own bike. <+++++> My Dad always drives my Mom.
Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley. <+++++> Hello, Alabama.
Take care of me? <+++++> You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
I thought you'd be happy to leave. <+++++> Why won't he talk to women?
What do you want? It - It's pitch- black out here. It's tin foil. <+++++> Pitch-black?! It -
I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone. <+++++> I love you. Come home.
Yeah... yeah. <+++++> Well, then...
Chauncey! <+++++> Hello, Eve.
Who is Friedman? <+++++> The man who sold the boy to your brother.
I wish you wouldn't say that.... <+++++> What?
I keep it for emergencies. <+++++> Anthony, we're on the run. This is an emergency. It's only fair that...
Here with you. <+++++> And it's a all real.
Uh-huh. <+++++> Yeah, so... I'm gonna wait and see what happens there... But that sounds great, yeah.
Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this eveningÂ <+++++> Oh, a party! Great, great! Jolly times and merry pranks. That's me. I'm a guy who loves parties. You knowÂ
Like you. <+++++> Beautiful?
It feels warm. <+++++> One more shot?
How comes it your are not afraid? <+++++> Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry. <+++++> This is no good.
Yes I did. <+++++> Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?
Um... yeah. Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one? <+++++> We have two... but we don't have the juice to run them.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared. <+++++> You ain't like that no more.
What you were saying. Keep talking. <+++++> What was I saying?
What's this? <+++++> What does it look like?
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords. <+++++> Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
Look, I... <+++++> Of all the <u>cheap</u> excuses. To break a child's heart.
Did you see that? It's remarkable! <+++++> Huh?
Don't worry, Lamar. <+++++> The nation votes this week...
I'm afraid I won't have time -- I gotta -- <+++++> 
... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology. <+++++> I agree.
Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan? <+++++> Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.
Oh, Ray... no... <+++++> You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish? Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.
I told you... She won't let you leave... <+++++> Son of a bitch!
Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother. <+++++> Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>. Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>!
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera? <+++++> Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
Not really. <+++++> Hey!
Yeah. <+++++> You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect.
I'm not listening. <+++++> Hey ! I'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.
Just a moment... if I may. It is possible this man was murdered. <+++++> He drowned. Anyone could see.
Sometimes too much. There's got to be an explanation. There can't be an animal in there. But I saw something. <+++++> What was it?
This whole thing is a joke! <+++++> Stay calm, please.
I realize you don't want to be involved. <+++++> I am not involved. Keep clicking your little wires. You'll get someone else. Good luck.
Where do you get this shit? <+++++> Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy.
I know. <+++++> Well, goodbye.
Dartmouth? ! <+++++> I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
What happened? <+++++> Nothing.
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes. <+++++> Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
Dennis! <+++++> Get your links set up!
You did the right thing. <+++++> I ruined your wedding night.
What are you talking about? <+++++> You said, "You don't make something up unless it's sure to help." How did you know that I made it up?
One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us' <+++++> They're all human beings
Like disposing of their wives? <+++++> Get that idea out of your mind. It will only lead you in the wrong direction.
Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame? <+++++> So?
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars. <+++++> And one good guy.
What's the time frame? <+++++> Right mafuck'n now girl. Fast as we can get you there. We wait any longer, someone goin' dead this fool.
Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing. <+++++> Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause. How are you feeling? <+++++> I am well, Admiral.
Why do we have to race for heaven's sake? ! <+++++> I want to get into the light, that's all. Please...
Scratched --  We did not take the initiative. <+++++> Of course you took the initiative.
Totally. <+++++> It's the first door on your left.
...thank you...  And how are you this evening, Doctor? No, we know that you're awake... <+++++> Good evening, Dr. Lechter. Thank you for coming. I am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances.
What? <+++++> I say, why don't you go to the Stardust Ballroom? It's loaded with tomatoes.
I like you too. <+++++> One more, eh?
Some what? <+++++> 
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here. <+++++> You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, "Don't get me upset.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic. <+++++> Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an "Ego Trip". <+++++> I'm not interested in that.
Mark, are you okay? <+++++> Yeah. I'm just aces.
No, sir. That's very unfair -- especially to your wife. <+++++> Yeah. You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his - <+++++> Thatcher! That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
What, I'm sorry I said that. Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it. <+++++> Lloyd, I love you, okay?
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map. <+++++> There is more in the Diary than just the map.
That's quite a secret. <+++++> I spent a week reading Sagan and watching re-runs of the Twilight Zone. Seriously.
Come on. <+++++> We've spent a lot of time discussing those years.
This is his assertion. <+++++> Where are they now?
Why's that? <+++++> Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
I think you've got the wrong gal, fella. <+++++> I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition.
Please. It's not going to wait. <+++++> I've got to stop and help those people.
I was with the Princess. <+++++> Where?
No!... No! <+++++> Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself. I deserve nice things. <+++++> I . . . can't . . . argue . . .
When you are ready. <+++++> Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.
These THINGS... they want to take me -- <+++++> What things?
Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems... <+++++> You're my only problem, Ed. What does it take to make you go away?
Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You. <+++++> Didja tell 'em anything else?
Where'd you come from? <+++++> San Diego.
Well, a hat... <+++++> What was it like?
Right. That explains it. <+++++> Are you going to make me beg?
Slowly or quickly? <+++++> As fast as I can.
It must be one of these... <+++++> Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
Fine, now. <+++++> I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy.
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread... <+++++> You mean you could use it.
She's not here, Sam. <+++++> Lester...
Okay, everybody, listen up! <+++++> Number one, American Teen Princess' don't cross their legs like streetwalkers.
I sure like the way he talks. It sounds like a race car motor idlin'. It makes me not be nervous. <+++++> I'm glad of it, honey.
Is she...alright? <+++++> I thought she was dead. For sure.
Are you all right? <+++++> This is a brutal land.
To be what? <+++++> Different.
I don't believe you. <+++++> Then you'd better start believing me.
To bed. <+++++> 'To bed'?
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him. <+++++> Huh, I doubt it...  Friedman only deals directly with select customers. I handle the rabble...
Charlie...? <+++++> Nobody knows anything, believe me.
So close... <+++++> And so far.
You'd hold us back. We have to go on. <+++++> Hmmmmmm? Oh, yes. Go on.
I don't know, Dad doesn't either. <+++++> Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here. <+++++> I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
Sorry. <+++++> The traffic takes some getting used to.
I wouldn't bet on that. <+++++> I'm betting on you. You'll make someone a good husband one day. But I can't wait around forever. Don't answer now.
Not even a guess? <+++++> 
Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend? <+++++> BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD!
Hi, Daddy. <+++++> What's new?
Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory? <+++++> Aye. Before the wee pesties attacked.
Fine with me. Just somebody then better go and round up Melissa Marr. <+++++> Where is she?
I don't have a goddamn credit card. <+++++> Now that's too bad. I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
How much do you weigh? <+++++> 195 pounds.
Not all that pasta. <+++++> Fine.
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes. We were trying to restore her... <+++++> What happened in those three...
Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think? <+++++> You're not lying to me, are you?
Incredible. <+++++> All right.
The milkmaid's daughter? <+++++> Well, why not a milkmaid's daughter?
No, Kelly, I don't want to... <+++++> Come on, it's fun!
Mr. Dardis does call in every so often? <+++++> Well of course.
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party? <+++++> Some say you are, Rocky.
Why? <+++++> Probably because it sounds scary. *
I dunno. <+++++> Think about it, Rob.
Meurice-- <+++++> You don't look too good. You sleep last night?
Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her. <+++++> Really?
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird. <+++++> Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence? <+++++> I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
No, after you. <+++++> You don't trust me?
From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental. I thought that was understood... <+++++> Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party.
Most of the yard we'll just level. I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said -- <+++++> You what?
What are they like? What are they about? <+++++> Well, usually, they're... simply morality tales. There's a good wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end.
She's quite a girl, that what's-her name... <+++++> Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
I'm glad we talked. <+++++> Good-bye.
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there? <+++++> No.
She's busy. <+++++> Convey her a message.
What do you think? <+++++> Oh. Eh, I like it.
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this! <+++++> Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
C'mon. <+++++> Well, there was this one time --
Schulz, you're off your nut! <+++++> Give me the radio.
I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know. <+++++> Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
Norman... <+++++> What can it hurt to talk to someone?
Then why'd you get married? I'm asking you as a friend. <+++++> You're jabbing at me. _ 112.
It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor! <+++++> An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
Yeah. <+++++> Oh, God, that would be something I really want to do.
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for! <+++++> Bullshit. Put the phone down, Mason.
And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really. <+++++> Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
What's his name? <+++++> Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
Far as I know. <+++++> Is he coming home?
It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them. <+++++> Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you. They ought to be grateful to have you.
Few minutes? <+++++> ...Ten minutes.
Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now. <+++++> A hundred and one next month.
The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter. <+++++> That'd be a first.
I don't know what to say to him. I can't. <+++++> You think it over, Leon.
....yeah.... <+++++> So that was your pudding?
I feel great I got no sleep but I feel like Orlando Furioso! <+++++> You were a tiger last night.
Heard where? <+++++> Where I come from. Boston.
Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal -- <+++++> I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
You, you don't under... <+++++> Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen!
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid? <+++++> Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell? <+++++> Who?
Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God! Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God! <+++++> Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
The address? ! <+++++> York Ave.
No. It hadn't. <+++++> Don't fuck with me, John, don't fuck with me...what are you saying?
There. <+++++> Where?
And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you? <+++++> A good reason, I suppose.
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were. <+++++> Who's to say you can't make things better?
Because my mom gets the bill. <+++++> She's not going to notice, Anthony.
What? <+++++> Grand Old Opera --
The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago...  the hand will come back...  they're sure... <+++++> Jackie, will you hand me the mirror?
Thirty aught six. <+++++> You ever had to open it up like that before?
Al! <+++++> No. The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.
You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there. <+++++> Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
I said you win. <+++++> Win what?
You're sure about this two person thing? <+++++> Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.
Touchy. <+++++> You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
Well -- <+++++> About what?
I'll bet. Look, Sam. Why don't you come by this weekend. We'll take the boat out... <+++++> Sorry, Sandy. I've got plans.
You're always taking time off.... <+++++> I like to travel....
I don't know about you, but I feed off my emotions. <+++++> He'll string us along all the way if we're not careful.
Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband. <+++++> To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point.
You won't believe it! Guess! <+++++> Where?
Uh, Buzz?! We missed the truck! <+++++> We're not aiming for the truck!
What are you doing? <+++++> Going back  - to the jungle to die.
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid. <+++++> Perk.
When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am! <+++++> Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
Anything. Anything at all. <+++++> Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof. <+++++> How do you know?
Look, you don't understand. I need a job. I've got a kid and-- <+++++> I understand and I'm absolutely sure something wonderful will turn up....  ...after the first of the year.
See anything? <+++++> No.
You said you could help. <+++++> I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work...
I didn't do it. <+++++> You could have.
Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son. <+++++> Gosh! You see sir--I was fixing some plaster for a cast on Amos' leg-- he's always chewing 'em off.
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em. <+++++> Anything good?
Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva lot to discuss. What about you, Mike? Are you married - you have kids? <+++++> Well, yah, I was married. I was married to - You mind if I sit over here?
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's. <+++++> When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys -- <+++++> I want you.
Who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes? <+++++> I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
Anything for science, I guess. Janey, there's something -- <+++++> We should get back --  What?
He said what? <+++++> "You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money. <+++++> Hello.
Oh man! I could've gone all night without looking at that. <+++++> I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
Who is she this time? ! <+++++> She is always Aphrodite.
--the witch kills children-- <+++++> I haven't killed any--
Well, ain't no use hanging around here. <+++++> Ain't gonna collect your pay?
IÂd be happy to. YouÂre welcome. <+++++> Oh, donÂt be that way.
Out of self comes selflessness. <+++++> Show yourself. The real you. The secret you.
-- where? - <+++++> -- make the left -- toward the bridge --
Laura. <+++++> My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming. <+++++> Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression. <+++++> I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other.
Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy? <+++++> Who was he?
Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately -- <+++++> Guilty until proven innocent?
They're coughing. <+++++> They're gonna die in there!
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea... <+++++> Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.
It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ? <+++++> Right now -- I am.
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour-- <+++++> No. <U>Knots</U>!
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you. <+++++> Yes, we've been through death and life together.
Why not? <+++++> You know how it is. You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
When you get going on those broads, think of me! <+++++> Animal! Animal! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? A couple of guys are trying to escape and you're thinking of broads. Broads?
You don't like him do you? <+++++> Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble. See? <+++++> Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
I lost my parents. I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ... <+++++> Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?
What happened ? <+++++> The power went out in half the park.
WHO ARE YOU? <+++++> How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name. <+++++> I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
Can I help you? <+++++> Yes, sir. I need a room
What? <+++++> This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you.
You don't know him - <+++++> You don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this.
That's what your crew said. Are they lying? Or are you? <+++++> I think you're the liar.
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about? <+++++> No, I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.
But... only when no one is looking. <+++++> Yes.
You fucking see that! <+++++> Oh my God!
No... no problem. <+++++> I wish I could return the favor.
Think you can do it? <+++++> Not from in here.
Oh. <+++++> Now, you just find him, son.
What are we doing here? <+++++> Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him, just like he said.
What? <+++++> Thinking there's someone who looks like you, walking around the street somewhere. Wonder if I saw him I'd think it was you?
I'm not gonna kill it. <+++++> You already have. Now go on. Do it.
Tomorrow. <+++++> Tonight! Right now!
I'm getting better all the time. <+++++> I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
Do I make you nervous? <+++++> Yeah.
"The Day After Yesterday." <+++++> Oh. You mean... today?
Just say it, Dad. <+++++> I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?
You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan. <+++++> Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose, Lila, to quote Janet Jackson.
Frank is coming? <+++++> No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay. .
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman. <+++++> No need to be modest, Brian.
 <+++++> He did?
It makes life spicy. <+++++> He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother. You know what he called Father one time?
No. Just you. <+++++> Promise me you'll keep it that way. You're not like the others, Laddie. You're like me. I can still remember, too.
The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings. How's your neck? <+++++> It's hard to swallow.
We can wait. <+++++> Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
Like what? I'm not -- <+++++> You're staring at me.
Why? <+++++> I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl. I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
What's the first? <+++++> Lawyers.
Hi, Dad. Dad, this is Jessica. <+++++> It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
ThÂthat's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural. There are snickers from the background. <+++++> Well, anyway, IÂI guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys.
However, the company doesn't want you to do that. <+++++> What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
What happens when the baby comes? <+++++> We're moving. I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much.
You have? <+++++> A few times. Sometimes I sit in that coffee shop across the street and watch when you take him to school.
Back? You're sending me back? <+++++> It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet. <+++++> Where did it come from?
Cathy Â- how does it feel to have a father? <+++++> What an odd question!
Just out. <+++++> "Out." Well that's great, Geoff.
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound? <+++++> He only weighs ten ounces --
I don't. Patrick doesn't. And his brother and sister don't. And they're in the house with him. <+++++> Fine. Maybe I got nothing to lose. 'Cept you.
Yeah. Come on. <+++++> Hold on.
The prom -- you going? <+++++> Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try. <+++++> You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule. <+++++> Yeah.
Don't know if God wanna see me. <+++++> He knows where ya at. Just answer the door if he come knockin'.
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him? <+++++> He already knew it.
Fifty lire... <+++++> What you find tonight on the floor between the seats?
Uh-huh. <+++++> Uh-uh. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.
I have no problem with that. <+++++> Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
That's for sure." <+++++> Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land.
Why are you here...? <+++++> I..
I can't...I can't find a shelter <+++++> You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that? Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot.
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars. But now - I wonder - <+++++> Yes?
What were you saying, Stanley? <+++++> I was saying...thinking maybe I'd get my own quiz show someday, Jimmy. Just like you!
Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam? <+++++> The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died.
I must find out what Berger knows. <+++++> Be careful.
....what the fuck, what the fuck.... <+++++> This happens....this is something that happens.
Pardon me. I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock! <+++++> Stay calm, everyone! !
She is, Mama... When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school. <+++++> How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.
The red hair... It's bad luck. <+++++> It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why.. <+++++> Why the masquerade? Why take the risk? Well, Claire, youÃ­ve asked the question and you are the answer.
What? <+++++> It never happened.
I don't know, why? <+++++> To prove he wasn't chicken.
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow. <+++++> I know. Take care of yourself, man, OK? Be cool.
Oh. <+++++> It's really quite all right.
Can I go in? <+++++> Jeff, would you go in with her?
I need you ... <+++++> Bullshit! You don't need me! You've never needed me! I can't help you! Understand?! I have to get out.
Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa. Would it be okay if I called you Mommy? <+++++> It would be so okay.
Hello, Benjamin. <+++++> Oh. Hello. Hello.
I got there just short of too late. <+++++> Lucky.
Feeling <+++++> Like I'm outside in the rain
You're <u>sure</u>?? ? <+++++> YES! JUST DO IT!
Who are you waiting for? <+++++> Stick around and find out.
Sure. That's great, Ray. I think you should get down there right away and check it out. Let me know what happens. <+++++> No, this one's for real, Peter. Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.
I confess. <+++++> I keep waiting for the next novel to come out. Anything in the works?
I told you to go on in. <+++++> Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...
Stop fooling around... I need to talk. <+++++> What's the matter?
I was. <+++++> What'll you do if one of them catches you?
Handymen, Earl. We're handymen. <+++++> Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
Ronnie ship out this mornin'? <+++++> It's so stupid. Says to me that he don't want nothin' to do with no military career. Says he wants to move.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted? <+++++> It didn't go anywhere. But that's not why --
So it's true, then? <+++++> What?
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face? <+++++> FUCK YOU!
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not? <+++++> I had the cause of death.
It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man! <+++++> Yes, but what sort of a man?
Couldn't it of happened on the fall. <+++++> It's possible. Possible however
Wheelchair accessible. <+++++> Dr. Argon, I demand an explanation.
They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach. <+++++> I don't think you'll appreciate their choice of weenie.
Hey, um, Toby? I was wonderingÂIs the documentary almost finished? <+++++> Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
You think I'd really drink that? <+++++> You don't think I put something in it, do you?
I can -- what do the kids say these days -- "dig where you're comin' from." You want to be rich, right? <+++++> Uh...
You're full of shit ... <+++++> Sonny, your wife's on the way ... We reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got.
Yeah. I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes. <+++++> In 76 years, me neither.
I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail. <+++++> You will, one day at a time. I'll be old and grey when it happens...
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room. <+++++> What do you mean?
How about this one? We didn't hit this one. <+++++> Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
Jesus, this is major. Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me? <+++++> Your people don't know about this part of out past. And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
Or your baby brother. What was his name? <+++++> Kip.
Have you seen Tamara? <+++++> No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
Oh, I have some suntan lotion. <+++++> She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.
I've been working hard, getting paid. <+++++> Where's the ice cream? The HÃ¤agen- Dazs butter pecan?
I'll be with you. <+++++> I don't want to go tonight.
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true? <+++++> Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
I'm sorry, honey. <+++++> No, it's okay. After all, he is the President, right?
Maybe he's wet? <+++++> Maybe he's hungry.
Not yet. <+++++> Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business. <+++++> Claude.
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth. <+++++> Now?
Zeke. Git! <+++++> Yes, Ma.
Yes, sir. <+++++> Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
I know better than you do. Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away. <+++++> Our abstinence makes our love immortal. If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.
Yeah. <+++++> The road's hell, you know? I mean airport, hotel, show. And airport, hotel, show. Airport, hotel, show.
Where's your husband? <+++++> Working.
Recovering nicely. <+++++> Me, too.
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody. <+++++> You may not care a lot about this place, Alice, but I mean to make it my whole life. It's been my whole life.
But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent. <+++++> Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
Helena -- <+++++> Tell me what to do, Carl. I need guidance, not a fucking platitude.
'Strapped?' <+++++> It means you got a gun?
Ten here. <+++++> Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied. <+++++> What else?
Thomas Cavenaugh. I am a teacher of sorts. Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life. <+++++> I learned my fill from Romeriz.
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart. <+++++> And the result satisfies.
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them? Maybe I should see the ...bodies. <+++++> They've already been identi- fied. There's no doubt.
How'd you feel about it? <+++++> I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do.
here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son. <+++++> I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder.
What'll it say? <+++++> You'll think me very bold, sir.
What the hell is with you, dog? He's the one with the damn gun. <+++++> You gave him ice cream, didn't you? Come on, let's go.
I'm not going to quit now.... <+++++> You're all I have left...I don't want you going in the water....
Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road. <+++++> Ready when you are.
Nicely said, sir. <+++++> Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking.
A long time. <+++++> You promised me an explanation.
Are you ready to put him in? <+++++> Not yet.
Two hundred cops? Was Mario Sanchez there? He owes me money. <+++++> I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it. Do you know why?
You say that like an amnesia victim. <+++++> Guilty. I am.
You're saying that I've halo'd innocent people? <+++++> I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
Look, I don't want a -- <+++++> It's not "love me." It's not "trust my handshake." It's make the sale. Get it signed.
Arlo, shut up. <+++++> 
Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes. <+++++> I got an overcoat on.
Oh. You like her? <+++++> Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
She died? <+++++> She grew up.
Absolutely, you have every right. I need you to do me a favor. <+++++> I've done you enough favors.
I'll tell you everything later. <+++++> Where's Corbett?
Natural to the line of work they was in. <+++++> Yessir.
That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness! <+++++> The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
She was never attacked. I think she made it all up. <+++++> Why would she lie about it?
But... <+++++> Good day.
You just this morning... <+++++> Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here. <+++++> I don't give a fuck what your reasons are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside Otherwise, get a warrant.
And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about? <+++++> Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE <+++++> It's true -- I know her.
Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother? <+++++> Er, yes ...
I don't want to have any conversation. <+++++> Good, cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person.
I want the money, asshole, what do you think? The money that Reggie hid... <+++++> I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio. <+++++> Sure... But your fee... considering you're way over budget, should be negotiable.
As much as Mother Miriam does? <+++++> As much as God loves you.
She won't remember you. None of them will. You will be forgotten. That is how history works. <+++++> A man can change his history.
But I'm not prepared to die. <+++++> I'd like to know why not. You thought life on Earth was meaningless. You despised people. So what did you do? You ran away.
What? <+++++> Anything.
No, I didn't. <+++++> You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator? <+++++> Mm.
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes. <+++++> How many you need?
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt. <+++++> Okay, give me my belt.
Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this. <+++++> Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
Captain, how will you be able to follow my charts --  --from up there? <+++++> On the Repeater.
No I'm not. <+++++> Are you intelligent?
Three devices of such lethal cunning. <+++++> Booby traps?
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe. <+++++> Nothing is... anymore.
Will you lease month-to-month? <+++++> Not for three-fifty.
So does anybody have any suggestions? <+++++> We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship. That would kill it.
Who's setting you up in this place? <+++++> Brumby.
I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz. <+++++> What I can appreciate is insolence, Mr Lombard!
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery. <+++++> Never threaten me, Boss.
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus! <+++++> The man you love.
He found you, didn't he? <+++++> Get on the bus.
I'd like to find a place where I can get some peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. I'd like to try... <+++++> What could be more restful than this?... Excuse me, what is it that you want to try?
If you did, you never showed it. <+++++> Ronnie...
Oh, by the wayÂwhat's your name? <+++++> What's that?
Yes, sir. <+++++> Have you notified the police?
So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. Okay? <+++++> What does that mean?
Jiminy Christmas. What do you want from me? <+++++> Corbett ruined my two-way. Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight.
I know. I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember? <+++++> You never said anything. About the drapes.
I tried to make you understand. The suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust--  Surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power-- <+++++> It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
You're not... seeing anybody? <+++++> No. Most of the time I'm thinking about you. And now... you've really changed.
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me. <+++++> He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength! <+++++> Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
I don't like to talk about it, Lex. <+++++> Weak sister. I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend. <+++++> I don't care about being hip anymore.
It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is. <+++++> What would she do that made it hard to resist?
Can I ask you something? <+++++> A dog bit it.
At the Houmfort. <+++++> That's nonsense, Alma.
Wouldn't you like to meet him? <+++++> Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job? Where did he pick her up? <+++++> Doped up kids all over town. Park was full of them last night. Very easy pickin'. Goetz's type.
How come it feels the same? <+++++> I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
Sonic Death Monkey. <+++++> What do you think? Dick likes it.
Something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see. Mmm. What was your biggest hit? <+++++> Hmm... my biggest hit? That would probably be "Dracula."
No way... GET OUT!! ! <+++++> Say it!... I'LL TEAR YOUR FUCKIN' HEART OUT, GIRL... Say "fuck me" soft - then I'll leave.
No, she never did. <+++++> Are you going to get remarried?
Do you believe in astrology? <+++++> Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology.
We're hung up here. Snagged. <+++++> Can you get us a line?
In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it. <+++++> But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--  --nose. How perfect does your child have to be?
We know the briefcase was empty, man. We know you kept the million bucks yourself. <+++++> Well, you have your story, I have mine. I say I entrusted the money to you, and you stole it.
That's the deal. <+++++> Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A.
What guys do. 'Nother order. <+++++> You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
That's because I wanted them to! <+++++> I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
You mean who hit who? <+++++> Yes, that's what I mean.
What's your Miami PD badge number? <+++++> 4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys? <+++++> I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.
Sam, listen -- I shot to defend my man. Other guy drew first. <+++++> If that was all, fine. But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much.
Charles... <+++++> What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to? What is it, Bob? !
Why did you catch that? <+++++> Because it was going to fall.
Yea. <+++++> I see.
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper. <+++++> I did go. Just back. Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.
What do you need my connection for, Diego? What are you going to do with it? <+++++> What do I do with it? Nothing. It's for peace of mind. It's for the principle.
Oh, no. Where will he go? <+++++> Far, far away.
She's here, somewhere. As a patient, of course. Maybe you'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk. <+++++> And her husband? What was he?
I lent it to a friend of mine. He took it up to Palm Springs. <+++++> Had to get away for his health, I suppose.
Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they? <+++++> Well, they can be.
Well, I do Barbara Rush. <+++++> Pardon me?
Take it easy, though. <+++++> All right, all right. But I - I -
Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this. <+++++> Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
Something bad. <+++++> And why are you back? Why are we here?
Doc!... It's not me, is it? <+++++> What?
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you? <+++++> Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
Your girl. Being a cop will be rough on her. <+++++> ...Have you been drinking?
It's quite advanced. <+++++> Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter.
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you. <+++++> No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm already running late.
Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about. <+++++> Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
Will you still get the money from your father? <+++++> I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.
What's that? What's it called? <+++++> One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points.
And not show it to me. Ever again. <+++++> That's going to cost.
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip. <+++++> The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>. ...hold on...
Well? <+++++> It wasn't my fault.
Got another gun and a stun gun... <+++++> And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
...with the affiliates. <+++++> Read the papers! Half the country's doing it!
What do you mean? <+++++> What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin? <+++++> I'm not a pumpkin! Okay?!! Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?!
Oh! What a picture -- and what else? <+++++> I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief.
No. <+++++> But you have had mistresses while you were away.
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno. <+++++> Yes.
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days? <+++++> Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.

I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you? <+++++> No.
You wanna get caught spying on Albert? <+++++> No, I want the NSA to get caught spying on Albert.
Are you crazy? After what happened today? <+++++> You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
What if I wanted to borrow those keys? <+++++> Oh, I couldn't do that.
She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow. <+++++> What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
Oh, well. <+++++> I should have kept going. I-I have a sneaking feeling, a nagging sensation I should've kept walking and...
Do you want me to stick around? <+++++> It's okay.
And you like them? <+++++> Well, you know... what do I know about clothes...

I'll get a manual. and study it. <+++++> FUCKIN' "A".
Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore. <+++++> I know what you mean. I...

The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us. <+++++> ...and four and five...
Hey. <+++++> Oh, hello.
But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize. <+++++> And now you risk the same fate. If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.

They were early. <+++++> What are you talking about?
Nothing, I guess <+++++> I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
I just need you for another minute now, so we can shoot from behind towards me, and, um... <+++++> Uh-huh.
Babes. <+++++> What?

Since sixteen or so. <+++++> I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
Now you've done it. You've given me nervous indigestion. Anything else bothering you, boys? <+++++> Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
I want you to take this... to remember by. <+++++> Where's my baggy pants?
Nicholas... <+++++> Shut up!
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office." <+++++> Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once.
I am. <+++++> Then kiss me again for I am not mistook.

Wait! When can I see you again? <+++++> Let me think. Hmmnn...  Never. Bye!
Today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler  She runs a settlement house down in the Village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher. <+++++> I'd like that.

Why? <+++++> Because I think they're after you.
You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean? <+++++> Nothing.
No one. Nothing. We've got to get this finished before the tide comes in. <+++++> It's not nice to be evasive.
Nobody's hearing nothing! <+++++> Humperdinck. Humperdinck! Humperdinck!
No, there's another point I want to iron out. <+++++> Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.

Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it. <+++++> Take it yourself. Take a date.
But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box. <+++++> This gonna get you in trouble?
More or less. <+++++> Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
I thought it was Taylor's case? <+++++> Sucked in officers from all over the county. And it was the worst six months this station ever had.
Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants. <+++++> Certainly. Senator.
They know, don't they? <+++++> Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman? <+++++> Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.
And they went to the stockholders in New York. <+++++> Oh God.
There! You said it was boring. <+++++> Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!
I donÂt. <+++++> Good.
I remember every minute of that party. <+++++> There's my dad with Joanie.
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist? <+++++> Just relax.
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow... <+++++> You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
All right. Give me a voucher for expenses. <+++++> What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island.
Is this a friend you had when you were away at school? <+++++> No.
I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned. <+++++> Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that?
We don't seem to get much time to talk. <+++++> I know. I'm sorry.
Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe. <+++++> What, again?
Or maybe forfeit it to us-- <+++++> Shit!
Burgel doesn't like anybody! <+++++> He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
During the time I cooperate, will I be outside? Outside a jail? <+++++> Well yes I suppose ...
It couldn't be simpler. <+++++> First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
Viscera? <+++++> Blood and guts.
He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over. <+++++> Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
And all we've got is a witch doctor! <+++++> Yeah.
Now I know why all the girls come here. They know how horny you guys get. But this...is ridiculous. <+++++> It's not that.
It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes. <+++++> Our purposes.
Give me a cigarette. What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you? <+++++> Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
What telegram? <+++++> 'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect.
Well, I should be getting... <+++++> ...It's really getting late.
Shit! David, what is that? <+++++> I don't know. Come on.
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General. <+++++> There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
No, I don't mind. <+++++> I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
Yeah. Ten months we've been fishin' this river together. We use the same equipment, more or less... <+++++> ...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
You always want to run everything. <+++++> If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera. <+++++> You know, I-I think... if I could pry this door off... We shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they don't have legs.
It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on? <+++++> It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems...
Why not? <+++++> If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
Sister Mary Patrick? <+++++> Yes?
You're a caterer? <+++++> Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older, it's definitely something I want to do.
Yeah. <+++++> You lost your control.
We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second. <+++++> Fine.
I want to be baptized. <+++++> Baptized? Well, get baptized then. I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin' preacher, goddamnit! I can't baptize you.

Now many? <+++++> Can't tell. Lots. D gun's down to twenty. Ten. It's out.
You're a lot like my father, Cooper... you think with your heart. <+++++> Used to Filmore, used to.
That's absurd. <+++++> I've seen it on television.
And these were drawn from life? <+++++> Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
Ellie, get the gun! Try to reach the gun! <+++++> I can't get it! I can't get it unless I move!
You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition. <+++++> Don't give me that. I know what's real, goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer.
What? What is it? <+++++> It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT!
You're going? <+++++> You're going.
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week. <+++++> What? !
General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain. <+++++> Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.
Thanks. You, too. <+++++> Be seein' you.
Dad, you there? You okay? <+++++> Yeah. I'm okay. What about you? I want to know. About you. And your mom.
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light. This bucket of blood. <+++++> You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody. I know where I made my big mistake.
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys? <+++++> Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense. You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him. <+++++> That was Nancy, not me!
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble. <+++++> Who?
Have you come across Fuchs? <+++++> Fuchs...? No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise...
Of course, they weren't nearly as bashful. No, this room was once filled with bare buttocks. And pricks. Hard, arrogant pricks -- <+++++> Cut it out!
What a screw-up. <+++++> Right. I screwed up. I fucked up. I messed up. Anybody could have done better, especially you.
Then, this is what it would sound like underwater? <+++++> Yes, sir.
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect. <+++++> Why the hell not?
What? <+++++> A good start.
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there? <+++++> Yes it does.
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him. <+++++> He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie. <+++++> It's so hard to believe.
Wilton Estate. <+++++> Nice family, are they? Church-goers and all that?
You may not remember things. <+++++> What things?
Okay. Yeah. We know <+++++> All right. I'll be back
Well, hello to you, darlin'. <+++++> What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate! <+++++> Wow. You believe in me that much--
I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all. <+++++> What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
No ... it's just going to start now ... If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep. <+++++> There'll be time for that.
We want you to help run it. Give speeches, lead seminars... Handle the fund-raising. <+++++> Fund-raising? ?
Three hours. <+++++> You got a deal.
What's that? <+++++> You're still jealous.
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman? <+++++> Y-yes--
Please. <+++++> We did this before.
Naturally I did. <+++++> Oh!
...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone. <+++++> She's not here, Sam.
Just my son and I. <+++++> What is your purpose in Mexico?
Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974. <+++++> Thanks.
You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past. <+++++> That is what I said, Doctor.
Lucy; come back! <+++++> Somebody's gotta do something! !
Yeah? <+++++> Next time you have a thought like that? Keep it to yourself.
Today ain't my day. <+++++> Bummer, huh? And Friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day.
He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters. <+++++> What's going ON!! !
 <+++++> All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty rituals which made us late.
Let's not start that again. <+++++> My back is killing me.
I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... <+++++> Pee...Per...Man.
Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it. <+++++> No...
Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man. He's gonna get me killed. <+++++> I'm a little worried --
Nothing further, your Honor. <+++++> Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said. You know now, don't you? <+++++> Yes.
To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever... <+++++> I hope you mean what you say, Eve. I intend to hold you to it.
Typical male. <+++++> Typical male.
Put more into it! <+++++> YEA, ART THOU THERE? !
Where's Shorty? <+++++> I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.
I am tired. Dawn is coming. <+++++> But I just got here --
Four years he been in the field... <+++++> ...and you know how many times he done been shot? Seven times! Seven.
...what? <+++++> Do you think you could make a cup of coffee, cause I'm going to work.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me. <+++++> Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.
Damn fool. Sir. <+++++> Captain, he's fast!
Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was. <+++++> I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
Allan Harris. <+++++> Chess team Allan Harris? !
The Lord be with you. <+++++> And also with you.
Just sugar then. You and John ever come here? <+++++> We used to, every summer.
Don't curse. <+++++> There you go.
And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath. <+++++> Oh, no.
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word. <+++++> Okay, Lou-is.
Gee -- those look like diamonds! <+++++> Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
Whoa, whoa...  What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz? <+++++> A trial takes <u>time</u>, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?
That was an egg? <+++++> Three days ago it was.
Is that how you feel? <+++++> Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
That about it? <+++++> ...Something like that.
Is it a secret what you're doing here? <+++++> I had to see you...
No. <+++++> Bud, this is me, Lindsey. Okay? You know me better than anybody in the world. Now watch my lips... I saw these things.
Hey, baby. What's wrong? <+++++> What's that outside, Daddy?
I just sat and listened. <+++++> Safe and secure is how we want her. Until she I.D. 's Venza.
So what? <+++++> Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
snow shovel or anything or something. <+++++> I think I left it there, I'm sorry.
Oh darling -- is that for me? <+++++> No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.
I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated. A few hours. <+++++> You sound certifiable. Yon know that.
You goin' out? <+++++> Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be. <+++++> That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
You turned Renard. <+++++> Just like you...only you were even easier.
Why? <+++++> I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?
No it's fine, really, uh-- <+++++> Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
See! The big guy likes it. <+++++> I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me? <+++++> No. I'm jus' gonna set awhile an' then go to bed.
Strange. <+++++> But a good strange.
Right here. <+++++> Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.
Police. Nobody move. <+++++> He tried to kill me!
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins. <+++++> I'm only a little fool - I'm an amateur at it - you're a professional.
It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me... <+++++> How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?...
We should be going -- <+++++> Yeah, no, I have to get something from my car, I said.
You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights. <+++++> I'm afraid we'll be working on a strictly freelance basis.
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club. <+++++> Can you arrange a meeting?
Well, not exactly... <+++++> Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it. <+++++> Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
What's this? <+++++> You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
Yeah. No, not really. <+++++> Let's work it.
Listen. Maybe I should go... <+++++> I've been a Little dyspeptic.
Are you talking to me! <+++++> Yeah. Come onÂwe're stopping here for the night.
C'mon you guys. Obviously that's a little more than our budget will allow. Basically, we're looking for something around two-hundred dollars. <+++++> Oh, why didn't you say. For two-hundred I got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back...
Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J. <+++++> Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
They were just tasting the berries. <+++++> Yeah? ... Well, I gave 'em a taste of American lead ... and I don't see 'em coming back for seconds!
Then let's set the date. <+++++> How about a month from today?
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction? <+++++> What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read? You're the only one that knows. <+++++> Like it never happened...
I forgot your name. <+++++> Dr. Crowe.
I told you, the government pays. It's all taken care of. <+++++> No, you don't understand. I <i>can't</i>.
All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca. <+++++> You love her that much?
There was a third man - he didn't give evidence. <+++++> You don't mean that doctor?
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you. You know, just to see if you're interested. <+++++> We're not.
...yeah....well you have me now. <+++++> You sound very cute, very nice.
Up and around? Soon? <+++++> Soon.
What'd he say to you? <+++++> Nothing.
It's always so quiet here. <+++++> If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers. <+++++> If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...? <+++++> Just check whatever you were wearing last night. Now!
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court? <+++++> You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
Who knows you have these? <+++++> Only you and the photo lab.
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us? About our-our personal life? <+++++> Me? Of course not.
Yes -- which is why "quiet, dependable people" have to take charge of their own lives. <+++++> At the cost of others? You accuse people of murder without trial -- apparently without irony. Did you go to the Castle with Eduard?
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way. <+++++> I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'.
You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome. <+++++> Lara --
Want to hear my favorite aria? <+++++> Opera?
Are you out of your mind? You scalped him! <+++++> You told me how to do it!
I'm checking on that. I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it. <+++++> I don't think so. I'm busy Thursday night.
We don't want to go there. <+++++> No we don't. But that's where we're going.
 <+++++> Did you clear this?
Three seconds... two... one... <+++++> SHIT! !
Right on -- he's been waiting for -- <+++++> And shut up.
Too bad you didn't connect. You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it? <+++++> No.
Fucking Danny, man... <+++++> He's an asshole.
I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street. <+++++> Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe? <+++++> Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more.
Not bad. What for? <+++++> That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out. <+++++> What! ?
Yeah! Like me! I don't choke on my own gall - I fight back! Let THEM choke, not me! <+++++> I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -
Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped. <+++++> No, I'm not.
Promise you won't. <+++++> Yes, I promise.
The ride is free. <+++++> You got a deal.
Pack up. I'll see you get back to London. <+++++> Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
NO, that's fine <+++++> I thought you were supposed to keep them.
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache. <+++++> So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie. <+++++> Oh my God. I'm so dead...
Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful. <+++++> Got any requests?
What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself. <+++++> I need to sit down a minute.
And where are you going? <+++++> After that re-...
I have a better idea of where we can go. <+++++> Ok.
Jeff. Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with? <+++++> Not quiet yet. We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West. She told us this morning. It doesn't mean much.
Just when we have all the cards, Vaughn. Take these two behind the van. <+++++> Move!
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph? <+++++> A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet? "Just A Gigolo . . . "
Have you found a place to stay? <+++++> Yeah, downtown.
Pelting down out there. <+++++> People might be better off. They thought about it, spent the evening back in the...
Congratulations. <+++++> Same to you.
You and Verona? <+++++> What? We took bathes together when we were kids.
What are you doing? <+++++> Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
Nail it! <+++++> Yes, sir.
Wait I... <+++++> You were paid to take me out! By -- the one person I truly hate. I knew it was a set-up!
Oh? And what should I say? <+++++> Just...say...no.
Well, maybe he's sleeping. <+++++> You think?
What are you doing home? <+++++> I always felt I could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me.
Give it to me. <+++++> What's this supposed to mean?
Oh no. The big house does things to a man. <+++++> The big house?
Mm. <+++++> Good?
Why should I? You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness. <+++++> Why do you want to teach me?
So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately. <+++++> Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen.. <+++++> Listen to what?
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man. <+++++> You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
That's because he knew. He'd seen these files and knew. <+++++> Knew what?
Golly, I hadn't thought of that. <+++++> Don't we always take good care of you?
You could stay with me. I know Things, Wyatt. Sweet things. I Could make you so happy. <+++++> I can't, I'm sorry. Forgive me.
Did you find out about her parents? <+++++> You're on leave, man. You're on psycho leave. I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
You knew when you first saw me. You knew it would be like this. <+++++> Shush.
Naah, Wilder knows we got friends in town. <+++++> That plane might've been to throw us off the track. Remember the bait-and-switch Wilder pulled with the Eskimo and his truck?
No. <+++++> Did he try to?
You forgot something. <+++++> What?
Here we are. <+++++> Well, son, you're home!
There's some bad holes, man, and the cracks -- water's coming through the cracks. Food's shot to hell. <+++++> How much is left?
Its metal, god dammit its metal. <+++++> What does that mean?
Where am I? <+++++> You're in the Records Room.
Uh - - thumb! The same way. <+++++> It changed. Why? Okay, back over your wrist. Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
What are these? <+++++> Mixed hard bondage. Rape films. Sick shit. Buy five, get one free.
Epps. <+++++> Yeah.
Yo ho ho! <+++++> It's three.
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom. <+++++> I didn't do that.
Anonymous letter writers -   I've got guards in front of the house, and I'm going to arrange - <+++++> Please don't talk any more, Charles.
We believe? <+++++> Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
Nuke--  Good luck. <+++++> You too...Meat.
Forget it .I'll take six, no, seven chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a Big Mac, and two apple pies. <+++++> You only want one Big Mac?
Stop it! <+++++> Please, Nicholas, let me show you...
Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records. <+++++> You come to the right place.
I suppose the idea was specialized training. <+++++> I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
Yes. <+++++> My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
You don't like Public Enemy? It's the dope shit. <+++++> I like 'em, but you don't play anything else.
I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this. Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go. <+++++> You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin... <+++++> Veronica!
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for. <+++++> A secret service agent. It must be.
Why, you don't want us to bring him over? <+++++> No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night.
And for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. I hated fishing, but I loved his stories. <+++++> Sounds like a special guy.
You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours? <+++++> Guess.
You fucked me, man? Why would you do that? <+++++> What do you mean 'why'?
Do you know Barbara Jean? <+++++> Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you! <+++++> It's over!
As long as your driving doesn't kill us. <+++++> It's okay, we're just about there.
Uh-huh. <+++++> So you're sure she's dead.
So I gathered. <+++++> Maybe he didn't like us.
Hejira. <+++++> And so now you're off to Glades.
It's worth it. <+++++> To each, his own.
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...? <+++++> Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father.
Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>! <+++++> Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.
Please. Why not? <+++++> Because it was a lie.
Romeo isÂItalian. Always in and out of love. <+++++> Yes, that's good. Until he meets
I <u>tapped</u> you. <+++++> Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have. How did you even know where I was.
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve. <+++++> Sounds to me like a wellÂeducated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
There, see? Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot. <+++++> Where'd you learn to do this?
Where what? <+++++> Where would you go to sell a chip?
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet? <+++++> You mean for TV or print?
What? <+++++> You don't have to talk about it.
At least I'm a growing person. <+++++> You won't keep growing at this rate.
At least Mitchell stood up to it. <+++++> Not like the others -- Dean, McCord, the rest ... We never got our side of the story out, Al. People've forgotten.
Where's Burke? <+++++> Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.
Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'. <+++++> Nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage. <+++++> Come again?
Dignan, it's got an alarm. <+++++> I don't think so. Just reach on in.
Do you remember where you lived? <+++++> It was warm. I was outside. The ocean?
Another jolly nickname? <+++++> You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
In here, Mom... <+++++> But, Chip...
You're a good officer, Major Mandrake. You have a right to know. It looks like we're in a shooting war! <+++++> A shooting war!
You're kidding. <+++++> No... They don't kid.

That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage? <+++++> I don't like alarms.

Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro. <+++++> Nothing for Kuzawa?
What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed? <+++++> Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first. But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
No. <+++++> Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
I was just tryin' to...to... <+++++> Tell it to Max. Tell him he's an asshole.
No. <+++++> You're not afraid are you?

You sound like an artist. <+++++> No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration.
Arrogant. That's Jane Butterfield all right... <+++++> At least we won't have to worry about her.
A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it? <+++++> Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird.

You want to take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is-- <+++++> Damn. Gonna be another hot one today.
It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley. <+++++> Are you going to meet with him?
'Course he does. <+++++> You know, when Larry and I got married, I thought we were so lucky we found each other so early.
I'll give you back the 600. <+++++> I don't want your money.
Something, huh? All those bids. <+++++> Yeah. Something.
There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it. <+++++> LaMagra --
No. <+++++> Indy, they glow like fire and get real crazy! Then he talk in this real scary voice!
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers. <+++++> I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
And some problems cannot be settled without one. <+++++> Well here is the problem at hand: the King has ordered me to discover the identity of the Governor General of Jesuits, and kill him.
No. <+++++> You will tonight. I guarantee it. I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.
You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze. <+++++> You working in San Diego now?
I don't know how you've reached that conclusion. <+++++> They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?
A Norms in Van Nuys. <+++++> Bastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys.
Salute. <+++++> Salute.
Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us. <+++++> Certainly not to me.
Isn't that special? Patrick? <+++++> Yes, Courtney?
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses. <+++++> And I intend to be there when she's ready.
Mom! <+++++> What happened? Is everybody all right? !
Mayfield? She fit into this? <+++++> She might.
May I please be excused? <+++++> Uh...yeah.
It wasn't like that. <+++++> Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.
Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet. <+++++> And that's exactly what he's going to do.
I can use a drink after the plane ride I had. <+++++> Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society. <+++++> Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
Did you shoot the officers in question? <+++++> Again I'll take the fifth amendment on that question.
Just do it, okay? <+++++> If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it... <+++++> 
Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of... <+++++> KRYPTONITE!
How are you? <+++++> Been better. I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
Listen to me, Peter. You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay? <+++++> You're right, but it's funny. All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.
Come here. <+++++> Oh, no. You'll muss me.
Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant. <+++++> My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch... Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.
They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow. <+++++> They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
They might think I was running away from something. <+++++> Possibly, Miss.
For a *question*. <+++++> Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
You seem... disturbed. <+++++> I... No. You do this for money?
No. <+++++> All right, then how about this?
Veidt's a fool. Tried to warn him about new information. Sicced his mangy cat on me. <+++++> What new information?
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice. <+++++> Tell your mom I said thanks.
Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving? <+++++> Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
Call that halfassed Army hospital and tell them to be ready to put some lipiodol in this kid's esophagus and take X- rays. <+++++> But it's ten-thirty at night. We can't get military personnel out for a civilian. A foreign civilian.
I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance... <+++++> 
You just can't stop editing me. Huh? <+++++> This is hysterical.
What's that for? <+++++> Nothing.
That's what they pay me for. <+++++> A great deal more than that, I believe...
Where! <+++++> I don't know.
Androids... don't have...fun. <+++++> Why not...?
Gangs. Spandex. And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls. <+++++> Are you talking about me?
A daughter. <+++++> So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
Why don't you help me? <+++++> Because I don't have time.
She still talking to you? <+++++> We're in love.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage? <+++++> Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.
What. <+++++> Tell me.
Maybe I ought to think about getting another job. <+++++> Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.
He's not part of the program. <+++++> Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
Mom, I need to talk to you. <+++++> If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
What do you want? <+++++> You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering. <+++++> I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean.
What? What? <+++++> Where was the prostitute? Where was she?
I intend to find out. <+++++> I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.
I got a couple of questions for the paper, Serg- eant? Mind if I swing by later, wring out a tea-bag with you? <+++++> My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?
And this happened before you and I hooked up? <+++++> It's been going on for a while. Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger. <+++++> Unlock one of the other storage rooms. We're going upstairs. We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
Do you still have friends on the force? <+++++> Yes, I still have friends on the force.
Don't mention it-- <+++++> I mean it. I--without you, I could't've--
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan... <+++++> Forget it.
Mason, you have to take this... <+++++> ...to Fort McGruder in his truck.
Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill. And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself. <+++++> And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women? That fuck.
Pretty sure. <+++++> Where did you shoot her?
I don't make the rules. <+++++> Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can.
I'm not sailing his boat. <+++++> But I thought --
Are you sure? <+++++> Why?
How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung? <+++++> I have done nothing against the ordnung.
Vulcan? <+++++> No.
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you. <+++++> I know that. But you can now.
Did he try to? <+++++> No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready. <+++++> Be right down.
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table. <+++++> Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday.
I'm telling you, baby, you always double down on an eleven. <+++++> Yeah? Well obviously not always!
No, anything is possible. It's up to Joe. <+++++> Joe, you don't know how glad I am you're aboard.
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop. <+++++> Then it must be a helluva idea.
Those things in your hands. <+++++> These? What are THESE? They're swords.
I figured it was. Where are you? <+++++> I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.
What kind? <+++++> An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates.
What? Steady like? <+++++> That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.

What does that mean? <+++++> It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
Do I get to see it or not? <+++++> Bastard...  Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.
FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government. <+++++> And they tell me I'm paranoid.
You're a long way from Inverness. <+++++> In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know... <+++++> I think you do know but you won't or can't tell me.
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago. <+++++> I'd say about two weeks.
How'd the camera get so high like that? <+++++> And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
Nothing. really! It's good to see you. <+++++> It's good to see you.

Yes, indeed, yes I am. <+++++> 
No cooking while you're here...No washing dishes...No cleaning.... <+++++> I'm not on vacation....
Not yet. <+++++> What kind of backup do we have?

Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.' <+++++> This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you? <+++++> Yeah, since I was a kid. I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time.

Don't do it. Don't aim at the head. <+++++> Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit. <+++++> You felt sad. What's your name?
Francis. You gonna leave the seeds in there? In the binding like that? <+++++> All will be revealed, baby.

Hello, darling. <+++++> Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that. <+++++> He's not your son.

I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day. <+++++> Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?

My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons. <+++++> The porter's got them. They're coming.

Time to change numbers again? <+++++> Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
I don't hope to impress you, but I may as well tell you: We haven't a farthing! <+++++> That is unfortunate.
Three for three. <+++++> If we stayed, we could make a difference.
Just what is your question? <+++++> What color were the original Hebrews?

I ain't hitting a man first. <+++++> Hit me in the chest with this...
I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do. <+++++> It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...

Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared. <+++++> We get Ordell to come to my office. Nicolet -- is he already there, or does he come busting in while we're chatting?

Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy. <+++++> Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to... <+++++> ...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal.
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere. <+++++> He told me... get help. I just stood there and watched him... I watched him die, Laz. Oh God! GODDAMMIT!
I'm so scared... <+++++> Don't be
Is that all? <+++++> He had his hand on her titty.
I'm homesick. <+++++> Homesick? It's only been two days!
Allie, he's not. <+++++> Not what?
The water. The wounds are clean. I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay. It's clean. <+++++> How did I get here?
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast? <+++++> Exactly. Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before. <+++++> What's he going to do? File a missing drugs report? If it works out, this guy might be good for a few more turns.
I just got a dial tone-- <+++++> The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
I miss Tommi so much. <+++++> So do I, believe me.
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you? <+++++> You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
I'll be down front. You better start putting your face on. <+++++> Y'know what?
This isn't going to be a problem, is it? <+++++> Not at all.
Passport, please. <+++++> Oh.
Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks. <+++++> What?
Kid--kid-- <+++++> And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time. It drives me nuts!
Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of Âem take a couple seconds...  ...some of Âem take a lot longer... <+++++> I asked you a direct question! A glimpse of what? !
Well--yes--I was saying--the State should reward you-- <+++++> Aw--
But you would not stay with me. <+++++> Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
I'm telling you. Wait three days... <+++++> You don't have to wait three days...
My mind plays tricks on me. Is it okay if I take a bath now? <+++++> Everyone is gone. Rhonda is in the bathroom.
On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners. <+++++> I can't afford to make exceptions.
Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party. <+++++> A third party?
Brady! <+++++> Get up there Rachel!
Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion? <+++++> Yes, darling.
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down... <+++++> No, no. I wouldn't hire a display designer if I didn't trust her taste. Maybe we should bring in more of that shade.
How did you guess? <+++++> Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Please calm down. <+++++> How many?
Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh? <+++++> Hmmm.
You have to help me. Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you! <+++++> I can't think of any.
I don't think so. Are you coming, Charles? <+++++> No.
Sir, please try to hold still. <+++++> So, I guess it worked.
Don't you agree? <+++++> He musta changed ! I got to get into the Nung River, here or here.
Yes. <+++++> Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
Do you miss Frederick? <+++++> No.
That's why it was four years between you and Thomas. It took me that long to regain her respect. <+++++> I'm not my mother. I can't have the respect without the knowing.
People walk around with masks and things on their heads. They're a bunch of crazy people there. <+++++> What am I supposed to do?
Northeast sir! <+++++> Unfurl the squares!
We got a cookaboo inside. He wounded some kid earlier. <+++++> How'd he get in?
Well, I -- I can't quite see. Why, she's crying. <+++++> Oh --
He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge. <+++++> I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
What's he look like? <+++++> He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
Please, Penny. You just gotta trust me now. Okay? And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right. <+++++> What? If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose? <+++++> I don't know, but it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through. Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
When? <+++++> We'll let you know.
You said five hundred and fifty! <+++++> So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
ThatÃs a lie! <+++++> Mind your tongue, madame.
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it! <+++++> Damn right.
Shelly's already told me all about sex. <+++++> She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.
Throw us in jail? I'm about to bust you right now. <+++++> I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
I certainly didn't mean you. Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman. <+++++> You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
You don't understand. I recognized his face now come on. <+++++> Big deal!
You love me now, don't you? <+++++> Very much.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson? <+++++> Yes, Captain?
What's it look like? We're going in. <+++++> Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --
Why would they use McCord--the only direct contact to the Republicans? <+++++> You saying the Democrats bugged themselves?
You want . . . Marlon and Al. <+++++> I have people in York Estates right under your nose.
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass. She anything like your ex? <+++++> Shall we mingle?
Checking up on my friend, Harry. <+++++> Oh Harry's doing just fine, he's just about to open up.
That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may... <+++++> No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it goes.
Time to cut a rug, Z! <+++++> I'm not in the mood. Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
She's my destiny. <+++++> Destiny? You living in a perfume commercial? She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
He's better off this way. <+++++> Nobody's better off this wav!
Huh? -- What's that? Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow? <+++++> I do -- and I think you should too.
What would you have me say, David? <+++++> Nothing. I guess I just wanted to thank you.
But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. "One for one. One for one." <+++++> Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
Fine, fine. Big doing up here. Why are you still down here? <+++++> The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.
Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go. Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long. <+++++> I won't leave you like this.
I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers! <+++++> Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War.
Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client. <+++++> You mean -- a jury trial?
Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever. <+++++> Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
How old are you, young man? <+++++> Nineteen, sir.
Well, not really, I -- <+++++> You are. Yes you are. What gave you the idea to paint on that cave?
Does it matter? <+++++> If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious. Don't forget your tiara."
I have a 4.0. <+++++> Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced "History of Lycra". What are your backups?
Oh Kevin -- don't stop! <+++++> Just a second!
Double-strength! <+++++> "Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!"
I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit. It's the only way to be sure. <+++++> Now hold on a second. I'm not authorizing that action.
Well, IÂd sooner mug an old lady... <+++++> You...  Jesus Christ!
Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel. <+++++> I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman.
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed? <+++++> I'm very neurotic.
Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy. <+++++> There you are dead wrong.
Knox, I don't believe this! <+++++> All I'm asking you to do is listen.
Oh! <+++++> A Turkish brothel.
Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills? <+++++> Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See? <+++++> Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
I shouldn't have come back here. It was a mistake. <+++++> Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
Asia? How... how could he get here? <+++++> Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
I can't. I got a back load of repairs and one of the mechanics called in sick and I haven't slept and--  Where to -- ? <+++++> I dunno. I know a place.
Oh my God! You're Rick Derris? <+++++> Yeah!
What's MOW? <+++++> Movie Of The Week. I went up for one this morning with Alan Thicke and Corey Haim --
Ah! That's more like it! What? <+++++> 
Oh, the record company sent these... <+++++> Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
Really! Is it gone? <+++++> Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions. This one took some work.
It's okay. It's alright. <+++++> I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
How much of a hurry are you in? <+++++> Tomorrow?
Are you apprehensive? <+++++> Why should I be?
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence! <+++++> Still to be held in Philadelphia?
Officer Reilly, vice. <+++++> There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
Hah. <+++++> Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
Of course it hurts. What does it look like? <+++++> I thought maybe he was pretending.
Who is this? <+++++> You mustn't hang up.
Naw, man, it ain't white boy day. <+++++> Shit, man, you done fucked up again.
You know where I live? <+++++> We're both professionals, Oatman.
I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff. <+++++> The good stuff.
 <+++++> 
Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late? <+++++> I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school? <+++++> When we fall, we fall hard.
I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction. <+++++> What business?
I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be. <+++++> Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian- <+++++> M'hm.
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir? <+++++> Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
So what do we do about this creep? <+++++> Last time, it was me against him. I wasn't strong enough...alone.
Where the hell have you been? <+++++> We got problems topside.
Yah? <+++++> Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
No, it's pronounced Aye gor. <+++++> But they told me it was Ee gor.
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later. <+++++> You got that right.
No. I told you, she's confined... <+++++> Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss.
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go? <+++++> Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
Besides, it's historically inaccurate. <+++++> What the fuck are you talking about?
James Penfield. He wrote the opening chapter, on 'The Berlin Airlift'. One of the best chapters in the book. <+++++> Hello.
I don't understand. Why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person... to hang onto? <+++++> What do you get out of it?
How? <+++++> I don't know how!
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink? <+++++> I'm a nurse. I always watch people when they pour something. I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.
I wonder if he's married. <+++++> He wasn't wearing a ring. But you don't want to date a cop Frida. They're so blue collar.
Bastard bit my chopper. <+++++> Hey! !
So far you've seen me and my dick throw up. What's next? Projectile diarrhea? Man. What a stud, huh? <+++++> Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking.
I'm already free... <+++++> Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
You know, Ma, why the Squire came to see Jabez? <+++++> Yes, Mrs. Slossum told me -- Lucy can't even keep a secret -- Selectman -- my son -- well, who would have thought of that?
And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake? <+++++> Joe, from the day I arrived to the day they fired me, I performed consistently, thoroughly and with absolute excellence.
You go first. <+++++> No.
Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me! <+++++> You better not slow us down, Denham!
I've been here. You were lookin, right at me. <+++++> I was?
But you're Irish! <+++++> There's no law, as I know of, to prevent it.
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know. <+++++> Well I think they come from... angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear. That makes good babies start to grow.
He'd rather die than be with you, he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway. Bury him all over the place. <+++++> NO!
All right then. Sure. I could use the extra dough. <+++++> Excellent. We'll have a most interesting time.
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back. <+++++> I hope so, sir.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you? <+++++> Eight dollars.
There is a grave disturbance in The Force. <+++++> I have felt it.
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met! <+++++> is very angry.
Do you know George Winton? <+++++> Old Howard Winton's cub?
You don't have to wait three days... <+++++> ...Okay, two...
Too late, it's written. <+++++> Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer. Don't you have any pull with the chief, here?
Yes? -- Tomorrow? <+++++> Of course.
I thought you were a businessman. <+++++> Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me.
Epps? You there? <+++++> Right here.
Give me a break. I checked back into the hospital- amongst other things. <+++++> Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
A report? <+++++> A police report.
So who you taking to the prom? <+++++> Huh?
That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful. Nightcap? <+++++> Raincheck.
Sure I got boots. I got boots right here. <+++++> Then lemme have 'em.
Good point. <+++++> Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it.
...son. <+++++> All right. Enough. Look...
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray? <+++++> Mr. Gittes...
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want. <+++++> And if I win?
I don't know, but you seem sort of distant. <+++++> Let's just do it, all right?
Lay off the bennies, Leo. <+++++> Anybody can clean the surface of an object, but dirt can find its way anywhere. To really clean, you have to scrub below the surface.
What's the larger experiment? <+++++> It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans.
Do you mind if I borrow it? <+++++> Not at all, if it can help.
I can't write this anymore. <+++++> Don't be silly. Of course you can.
I'm fine. <+++++> Everything went great, I thought. We really got you, didn't we?
Well can I come in or not? <+++++> I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison. <+++++> I am being exploited! Where are you going?
Really? <+++++> It's free to all.
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working? <+++++> I'm always working.
WhoÂs she? <+++++> Elektra King.
One considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down. Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive. <+++++> Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate.
Oh God. Shit... <+++++> Andy...
Jimmy, where do you find these people? <+++++> The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
No. No. He didn't mean anything by it at <u>all</u>... <+++++> Hello? No, operator...
I feel so <u>close</u> to you... <+++++> Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
A fellow investor. <+++++> Hmm.
No. Not at all, <+++++> You were expecting a deliver y that day?
What's that mean? <+++++> I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that.
I'd love to. But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone? <+++++> Oh, yes. Of course. Don't I always?
Do you know about the chip? <+++++> What chip?
Walter! <+++++> Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
He will. He has great faith. <+++++> But bad judgement. And now you see how dangerous the consequences can be.
If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me. <+++++> I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. <+++++> We'll see.
Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise! Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party! That's why New England loves him. <+++++> Hancock led the Boston 'tea party' because he's a goddamned tea smuggler! He wasn't protesting inequality, he was eliminating competition.
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call? <+++++> Well, all right, but...
OK, so who was it, then? <+++++> You can look it up.
You ever see her talk to the walls? <+++++> No, but--
Minutes ago. Harry's trying to decode it in his room now. <+++++> Where's it coming from?
I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone. <+++++> So, you do this for yourself? What about her? You cannot not have a relationship, Macleod.
I know. <+++++> But other people can see them too.
He's crazy! <+++++> I'm crazy?
How can I be sure. <+++++> I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
I'm ninety-two years old -- <+++++> Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think? <+++++> How many?
She's that subtle? <+++++> Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
What? <+++++> What are you looking at?
I'm o.k. I'm o.k. <+++++> Sure you are, sport.
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there. <+++++> I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
And I appreciate it. <+++++> You don't get it, Pham. The idea was: we were ripping you off.
What did you say? <+++++> I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
I like the service here. <+++++> Hey, he's not a waiter...
What is his room number? <+++++> I don't know.
Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there. <+++++> Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
Oh? What's the problem? <+++++> I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again. You were in Kiev. You tell me.
Bullshit. <+++++> I do, Jill.
You call about Monsieur Kane? John Michael Kane? <+++++> Yes. Is he there?
Me? ? <+++++> No! The man in the moon!! Who's driving this thing?
Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results? <+++++> Me. My home number is on this card.
Don't I look like I'm listening? <+++++> We want Brooklyn one hundred percent. No more taxes to you.
Try less appropriate. <+++++> Ben Gay.
Pattycake! Pattycake! <+++++> Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
The Red Sox <+++++> You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
I don't know. <+++++> Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
What are you doing? <+++++> He has no heartbeat!
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie. <+++++> Well, who's Sadie?
Like a club. Work less, make more. <+++++> Thank you, no.
Yep. How was your trip...? Help me clean up, okay? <+++++> You called the police?
Do you know what you've done to me? It's all over the national news now. You know what you've done to me? <+++++> Calm down, Dave, what?
What, "is"? <+++++> No, no ... not "is"!
Thanks you. Six weeks off does a body good. I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward. <+++++> That's a secret.
Access established. <+++++> Select uplink for Federal Communications Office. Department of Enforcement.
What? <+++++> Don't stop, just slow down. Little more space 'tween us and them.
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job. <+++++> You really need to be fucked.
Not so good. <+++++> No?
Hydrophobia... <+++++> Michael, take deep breaths.
How you doing, great one? <+++++> I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
What a day I've had! <+++++> Tired?
His wife. This guy says she was kidnapped last Wednesday. <+++++> The day of our homicides.
That's because -- <+++++> It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore. The world's about to end. I feel like I could save it.
What for? <+++++> You probably won't believe me.
No. <+++++> Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?
Enough to keep sane. <+++++> Enough to make shapes and shadows in the dark into something else.
How long is what? <+++++> You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
I'm not jealous! <+++++> It's clear you are, and it irks me.
What? <+++++> There's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.
Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw. <+++++> Would you please focus?
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today. <+++++> That's okay.
Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on. <+++++> You seem to be saying that this isn't just a case of resting until I'm better.
Not yee-aw, Ya'll. And it's gotta be angry. Like you're pissed off. <+++++> Good God, ya'll!
You know, hanging around with you is no picnic. <+++++> Anybody got any ideas?
I will treasure this. <+++++> Sally!!! !
2:00 A.M. <+++++> You doin' anything tonight?
Uh huh. <+++++> They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie.
Get him out of there. I thought I told you people -- <+++++> Harry? Can you copy?
I have to go to Venice. <+++++> See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you?
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account. <+++++> No we're not.
I'm off that case. He fired me. <+++++> He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in. <+++++> Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
The Daddy-Oh! <+++++> The Circle-o'-Gaiety!
Thank you, Frank. Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom? I asked you last week. <+++++> Didn't I do it?
Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this. Leave off. Here's your paper. <+++++> What, am I supposed to read it while I drive? Keep a grip on it, alright?
Keep going. <+++++> The view had better be worth it.
Just let it go, I've got you! <+++++> What're you nuts--
My jewels? ! <+++++> I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace...
Why are you asking all of a sudden? <+++++> No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
That'd be nice. <+++++> I put on the lotion you got me. Can you smell it?
Latitude 47 degrees. <+++++> Wait a second. He knows I know.
Is it drug related? <+++++> We don't know. When I have more I'll let you know.
You need to come home! <+++++> I can see that...
Take me home. <+++++> Home? This is your home. You're dead.
I don't want to live WITHOUT you. <+++++> But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile. <+++++> How much did they get from the safe?
Good school! And your family doesn't object to your career? <+++++> They do indeed. Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care.
But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning? <+++++> Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed.
Oh, I hate the other kind. <+++++> They're just doing what they do. Well the other kind - -  - - just do what they do.
Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years. <+++++> I've read of it.
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you? <+++++> Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already.
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed. <+++++> The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
What makes you so sure? <+++++> I got a file on him two inches thick. He's a petty fraudster. This is something else. Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
Swell! <+++++> Your friend was to remain where he was!
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh... <+++++> Like an underground club?
I'd like to stay, too, Captain. <+++++> You don't count.
It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of. <+++++> You afraid of the dark?
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right. <+++++> Would it do any good?
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up... <+++++> But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
Yeah. <+++++> Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
Bent? <+++++> Bent.
All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup? <+++++> When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him. <+++++> Is him stayin' here workin' out?
It's a waste of time. <+++++> Yes. I'm no fucking good.
Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you? <+++++> We're square.
David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - <+++++> Rawlston is my boss.
How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school. <+++++> She says I can come live with her while school goin' on, and come back home every time there ain't no school.
Here. A transport plane is due at eleven. Once I put him on it, it's all over. <+++++> So what's the problem?
Please don't. <+++++> I won't--  --if you won't tell what *I* done!
Oh, Maya. No. <+++++> Yeah.
My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us boldly go where no man has gone before. <+++++> <i></i> I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying?
Hey, what about the Amazin's? They pull it off? <+++++> You really wanna know?
Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish... <+++++> My God! The fork! The fork!
So how's business? <+++++> Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso.
If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me. <+++++> No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike. <+++++> We'll find him.
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around. <+++++> Good! Good! Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation.
What's he do? <+++++> I don't know, Kate.
What is it, a surprise? <+++++> That's right...
Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one. <+++++> Yeah, so things'll be even.
I told you she's just.. <+++++> A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again. Be back in an hour. Right?
Well, you're two up on me now. <+++++> Hey, you!
Out there. What do you see? <+++++> The Western Woods.
And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K. <+++++> I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly. Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
Okay. <+++++> If not for me, at least for Amy.
Feel okay? <+++++> Yeah.
Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel? <+++++> I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
What's my name? <+++++> What?
I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares. <+++++> Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
I'm thinking Rizzo was right. <+++++> Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
Check. <+++++> Okay. Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance? <+++++> Surveillance? By whom?
My God. <+++++> Not bad, huh?
I donÂt know how you did it, hoss, but you pulled it off. <+++++> IÂm out of the doghouse?
Let me finish, dear. You had your say, now let me have mine... <+++++> I haven't said anything yet, J.J., but if -
What happened? <+++++> A miracle.
Yeah, sure, I guess... <+++++> Watch my stuff.
Absolutely not. <+++++> It has your ring.
What do you mean? <+++++> After the gulls attacked.
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right. <+++++> Was a time I knew what was.
Yes. <+++++> What?
They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape! <+++++> It was a powerful air.
Sir, you waited on line. <+++++> Yeah, I know...
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear. <+++++> Sounds perfectly clear. Where does the Ostrich come in?
Go on. <+++++> 
You know this guy? <+++++> His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
Yes. <+++++> Sounds like a stall to me.
Guess what. <+++++> What?
I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards. <+++++> Where's the backpack?
Oh, no, no, no. It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway. <+++++> Why?
So much for honor among thieves. You would have cut loose your friends, your girl... <+++++> I was doing it for them.
What do you think? <+++++> Do it!
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley? "His play is always fair and just." <+++++> You're groping. I have been fair. It's my move now.
I couldn't bear it. I broke off my meditation. I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back. <+++++> What was it?
If I'd known you were alive -- <+++++> I would have done the same thing.
I know where it's going to be. <+++++> And where is that.
What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who? <+++++> Layton.
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected. <+++++> No sound at all?
Oh, she's really enjoying it. I think. Is Mac okay? <+++++> I don't know what's going on. I don't care to guess. Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all.
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass. <+++++> Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds.
Are you kidding?! You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table! You don't see that? ! <+++++> Eve? !
That's where she drew the line. <+++++> Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
Hi, Mickey... <+++++> What the hell do you think you're doing...? What's going on here...?
He's got a gift for fiction. <+++++> We got to do something nice for <u>him</u>.
--well and good, but when will he say it on the record. <+++++> He just did.
I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot. <+++++> Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
If they are? <+++++> We'll worry about that when we get there.
What? <+++++> I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
I don't know. <+++++> I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now?
-- but it was <u>him</u> -- <+++++> -- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and... <+++++> I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me!
No. She's probably scared to death. <+++++> Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
Oh, no. He told you. <+++++> You knew?
What do they want? <+++++> Every leader of every ship is given the codes to Zion's mainframe computer which can be accessed only through the Matrix. They are used only in emergencies.
I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some. <+++++> You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff. <+++++> I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, Envoy Extraordinary, acting under direct orders of Comrade Commissar Razinin. Present me to your colleagues.
What do you have in the box? <+++++> Just wait till you see this!
Yes, Amy. <+++++> But why?
Gimme a break, will you? Shut up. <+++++> Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
Three million? <+++++> Maybe more.
Neither is mine. And can't we talk about something serious for a change. <+++++> This is serious. Mr. Benjamin Horne's got a delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and I want both of you to learn to introduce yourself.
Eight. <+++++> Eight. Eight O' clock.
Are you saying she was- <+++++> I'm saying things got out of hand. Maybe they did take advantage of her!.
Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities. <+++++> Huh?
He's in the infirmary, being examined. <+++++> Did you ask him who he is?
Who? <+++++> Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
Mother-- <+++++> You make any sandwiches?
Mentioned it, is more what he did. <+++++> Still --
I have to go. <+++++> GO?
Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain. <+++++> We're your customers. We're not complaining.
She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas. <+++++> Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
And how. I thought you wouldn't respect me. <+++++> I did, I did.
Promise me.... <+++++> I'll wear my rubbers...I'll be careful ...I'll be....
And you said... <+++++> What else? Keep on keepin' on.
Well, Sampson, what is it? <+++++> Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
They're all O.K. Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go. <+++++> What about Jorgensen?
That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses... <+++++> Where did he get all that information?
You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it? <+++++> Hans Hinkel was in the Ministry of Culture; how could I know such a man? I
And I... I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not. <+++++> Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
Is he for real? <+++++> One hundred percent. And I like him that way.
He lies! I was there! I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache. <+++++> You seem fine now.
Are you IN5ANE? <u>I'm</u> the director! <u>I</u> make the casting decisions around here! <+++++> I thought this was a group effort.
YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job. <+++++> Would you?
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she? <+++++> If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
Brains extracted. Limbs torn to shreds. It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board. <+++++> So the method of death is the only connection?
 <+++++> What if he doesn't bite? What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese. <+++++> And you ain't black!
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this... <+++++> No, you don't owe me anything.
What? <+++++> You got us all worked up.
I'm sorry. Do you live here? <+++++> No, Joe, I'm swimming here. Then I'm going home.
of the Lechter case. <+++++> Yes.
--his dialing finger must be falling off-- <+++++> --what do you think?--
You invest in shows? <+++++> No - it's showgirls. I've been married seven or eight times.
I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully. <+++++> I don't think you realise what will happen if those files are made public.
What a creep. <+++++> And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.
Which way? <+++++> Across both tracks! !
I don't own a television. <+++++> A jet engine fell on my house... landed on my bed. While I was talking to Frank on the golf course.
What the hell do you think? I love Ann. You think I'm going to tell her about Cynthia and hurt her feelings like that? <+++++> God, you need help.
Don't talk. <+++++> You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk.
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement. <+++++> Well, wha...what kind of arrangement?
You've preserved my Jag! Smashing! <+++++> Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device.
It's one of the perks of the job. If you're interested, tomorrow I could show you some of my favorite spots. <+++++> You don't have to twist my arm. Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her. What toughened you up? <+++++> Information.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean... <+++++> Nothing I understand better than a mess.
I was here yesterday. <+++++> Yeah, I remember.
Are you kiddin'? He loves you. <+++++> You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?
What? <+++++> The LeSabre!
That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter. <+++++> What d'you expect?
They follow her because she's a --  -- no, I won't say that. <+++++> What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people.
What do you mean you've never made a prank call? <+++++> Never.
I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home. I'm going to go home. <+++++> Really? That's swell. No, I was just -- you're way ahead of me! Great!
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison. <+++++> There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that. Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could - <+++++> No tax shelters. No funding. I want to fund the clinic - exclusively. The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it. <+++++> Oh ho, so very infrequently.
I see. <+++++> I see.
So you're into "Reason," too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you? <+++++> Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...
Of course it is. <+++++> You're crazy.
Willya lemme talk for Chrissake? I'm trying to tell you what happened. What happened is... <+++++> The same thing that always happens! You blew it! And this time you broke your son's heart instead of mine!
C'mon on, this way. <+++++> I can see the shed from here! We can make it if we run!
Wouldn't I. Just watch me. <+++++> Chris -- Chris -- !
He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven." <+++++> So, what'd you say to him? "Double down. "?
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?! You mean you don't have ANYthing? ! <+++++> Well not much.
The so-called art of acting is not one for which I have a particularly high regard... <+++++> Hear, hear...
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy? <+++++> It's...it's a long story. Can we meet somewhere?
Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings? <+++++> Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
Hey, what about Veronica? <+++++> No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss.
But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well? <+++++> It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter? <+++++> I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.
Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug. Please don't jump on me. <+++++> I'm not going to jump on you!
I have some good news for you, Pumpkin. <+++++> What is it now?
I didn't mean for you to pay me for that. <+++++> I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
Easy Micheal. <+++++> He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.
It didn't work? <+++++> That's correct, sir.
Look... <+++++> You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know...
Drink! <+++++> Oh, no sir-ee. If yo don't have a reservation you can skip to ma-loo.
Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters. <+++++> Fan out and look for them.
She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit. <+++++> You lied to me.
I hadn't thought about it that much. I was thinking... well, it's an idea, the girl is oversexed, and... <+++++> Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all.
I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia. He wanted you to have it. He was very clear on that point. <+++++> I was looking for him earlier, but...
Come on Rachel! <+++++> Coming.
Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca. <+++++> But how could we...at a time like this when we just... well, let's at least first have a look around the other islands.
It looks that way. <+++++> What do you think we should do?
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it! <+++++> Be still!
I said let's go. <+++++> One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch.
All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down? <+++++> Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago. Said you looked so bad, he barely recognized you.
They pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want, nobody'll know you. <+++++> I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life.
Is Mrs. Kane - <+++++> Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane.
You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI? <+++++> I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
I'm not going to worry about it. We are quite beyond the computer disc. Everything will be over within the next hour or so. <+++++> Yew'll be ovah in the naxt tehn minutes...
It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex. We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren. <+++++> Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"
Yes, Osgood? <+++++> You're leading again.
You speak French. <+++++> What of it?
 <+++++> Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
Alive or dead? <+++++> Doesn't matter.
Thank you, Mrs. Rand. I think you're every bit as nice as Wes says you are. <+++++> So -- he says I'm nice. He's a nice boy, too, Miss Connell, a very nice boy.
Excuse me, sir...Bowman's sick. She's downstairs in the infirmary. <+++++> The infirmary?...
You have him in restraints. <+++++> Were you listening? We got two officers in the hospital.
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please? <+++++> Oh, of course. What is your name?
We got to get another pilot. <+++++> For what?
Did you leave the club with him? <+++++> Yes.
You have information and I need it. Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium? <+++++> No.
That bad? <+++++> I feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men. But hey, what'd I expect?
Run to the nearest phone and call the police. <+++++> Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that. I kicked their ass! Well, I tried. There were two of them you know...
Did you confront John about the visitor? <+++++> What visitor?
Pay money? <+++++> Yeah, dummy. Money.
In a holding cell. <+++++> How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
Fine, I guess... <+++++> Sarah, we could take off and leave this guy behind...
Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her? <+++++> Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.
113  CONTINUED: <+++++> I just want this over with.
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal -- <+++++> -- I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.
No. <+++++> There's probably one in the basement.
And this gives worth to butchery? <+++++> It was not butchery.
I'm a veteran reporter. I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime. <+++++> Underbelly!
That the problem, son? You Slow? <+++++> Otis, apologize to the Sheriff--
Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack. <+++++> Catholics. What do you expect? Oh, well, what's in a name, right?
Sorry. Old habit. I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop. My father was a minister. Lutheran. <+++++> What does he think of your chosen line of work?
One hour! <+++++> Drew!
Do you mean that? <+++++> I do.
The why'd the police let him go? <+++++> Because, obviously they don't watch enough movies. This is standard horror movie stuff. PROM NIGHT revisited.
I think you look beautiful. <+++++> Thanks for lying. But you're the class officer, Wick, and it'd just be weird if we hook up. Besides...
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship. <+++++> And what of the Enterprise?
How d'you KNOW we're "friends"? <+++++> Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
Got it. <+++++> Show us where you are, Chief.
She bought it. <+++++> Why?
It's so bad she becomes a werewolf. <+++++> You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later. <+++++> Business or personal?
Johnny? Did you see Ben? <+++++> Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
Flynn? <+++++> Yes. It felt like Flynn.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status? <+++++> We're getting close.
Yeah, what happened? <+++++> I figured, what's the point? I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me.
I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ? <+++++> Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
Left you this place. <+++++> It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
That's Applejack. You want to meet him? <+++++> Sure.
Oh, God. <+++++> Caesar? What the fuck time is it?
Sang. <+++++> Sang.
You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here. <+++++> Let me take the lead, Stephen...
You know my back. <+++++> What are you still doing here, Randall?
They're weird names. <+++++> They're Biblical. They were prophets.
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium? <+++++> Could be.
Aft thrusters - <+++++> Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin. <+++++> 'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
Just say so. <+++++> I'll be honest with you.
Is something wrong? <+++++> No, no, I just feel wired!
Wow. <+++++> And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
That's so sad. <+++++> There's hundreds of them. This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
Don't bore me with that bullshit. <+++++> How'd you find me here?
Why not? <+++++> Whatta you mean "why not"? Are you gonna play forever? !
I think it's in New Jersey. <+++++> It's in New York.
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory? <+++++> I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
I'm so burnt-out. <+++++> Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence. <+++++> I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job.
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now. <+++++> Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
Hm. <+++++> He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
How much further? <+++++> I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
The prospect of losing my child. <+++++> Very well, I'd like to see him if I may.
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart. <+++++> I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...! <+++++> Elora Danan!
The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade... <+++++> What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow?
What is this? <+++++> About fifty grand. I won it at the tables.
Escorts! <+++++> Do you even remember Al? Do you remember what he looked like sitting there?
Five minutes. <+++++> It's a bet. You're the witness, Emmi.
What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want. <+++++> I need money.
Do me a favor buddy, please. <+++++> What is it?
I haven't been nice to you. <+++++> You're hardly nice to anyone.
Keeping fit then? <+++++> Fine, fine.
I don't think that's true. <+++++> It is true.
May I cut in, miss? <+++++> You're still my best girl, Cora.
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too. <+++++> You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
Have you read all these books, Will? <+++++> Probably not.
SomeoneÃ­s after me. <+++++> Then we must call the police.
No, I do not think so. I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace. <+++++> I agree...
They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit. <+++++> Bandit II?
What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it? <+++++> Kinda.
What the hell are you doing? <+++++> I was... I was trying to open this tin.
Let's try this way! Holy Maker. <+++++> See Threepio, come in, See Threepio. I wonder where they are?? See Threepio...
Who are these guys? <+++++> Agents who died in the field.
Wow ... That's pretty good ... <+++++> Thanks. But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought "Gee.
Where are you going? <+++++> To get my money.
And the result satisfies. <+++++> Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
Not to be trapped. <+++++> You underestimate the trap, Mary.
Good. You're just what I need right now. <+++++> You got a minute?
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards! ! <+++++> Uh, yes, you do.
That one's an elm. <+++++> light shining) in her eyes) Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!
What? Yes, that's fine. <+++++> You're sure? There's lots more.
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady. <+++++> Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair. Your cousin. Deedee...you'r mother and I - we - we grew up together. <+++++> I want to see my mother.
Hey, man...! <+++++> You reach anybody yet?
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex. <+++++> David, stop!
We don't have much time. <+++++> What?
Caesar, what are you going to do? <+++++> What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
Never <+++++> Never, what? !
Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us. <+++++> 
Of course not. <+++++> Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
Eats them? <+++++> Yes. Whatever killed Beauregard may have lived on this plant. When the crates were put in secure storage, they were out of reach.
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell? <+++++> No.
I don't know... a little. I wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning. <+++++> I'm sorry. I couldn't.
Nothing, really! It's good to see you. <+++++> It's good to see you.
I didn't notice him. <+++++> We walked right passed him. He's following us.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me? <+++++> I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live.
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer. <+++++> Then go home, baby.
Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining. -- did you notify the coast guard? <+++++> No, it was local jurisdiction.
Very good shot. <+++++> You know I gotta hunch, fat man. I gotta hunch it's me from here on in... One ball, corner pocket.
That's pilot whale, isn't it? <+++++> It ain't a Big Mac. The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation.
 <+++++> Find that plant. Cut out its heart.
No. I suppose not. I didn't know you were colorblind, Max. <+++++> Only way I could stand your ties.
The one and only. <+++++> Proud to know you, Trapper. Like to shake your hand if you'll hurry up and get that chest closed. You still working the trains?
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you. <+++++> Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.
What do you think? <+++++> Mmm, needs a little something.
I never *asked* for any responsibility. <+++++> Just a little privacy.
Yeah. <+++++> For once Lex is right. It's over. Things can't get any worse from here.
They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune. <+++++> General, please... if you hear any rumors that I am a charitable person, will you please kill them at their source?
No, this is great. You'll love this. He's a singer. <+++++> Marcia's living with a singer?
I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot. <+++++> Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
Thank you. <+++++> He's my brother...
You want to know about the snakes? You saw one outside earlier, didn't you? When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified. <+++++> That's when you went in the sphere.
When? <+++++> '68.
You rigged the illusion to fail, right? <+++++> Yes.
Oh my God. <+++++> Don't look at me.
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank. <+++++> Yeah. What you doin' by here?
We're goosed. <+++++> We're not goosed.
NOT THAT ONE? ! <+++++> Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house? !
I heard you met Shu Lien today. <+++++> Do you know her?
Now? <+++++> Yeah.
And I'll bring my entourage... <+++++> Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to. There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's. Say 10:30.
Then make your choice. <+++++> I will. And I choose --
Wait'll you see the inside! <+++++> Can't wait.
Oh, it's nothing. No problem. I was really lucky to find this place. <+++++> All right then. That's important, isn't it? -- For you to be in an "up" environment.
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there? <+++++> Nothing.
So... what's your dark secret? <+++++> Why do you want to know?
I know something no one knows. He has had his finger removed. On his left hand. It left a scar. <+++++> What shape is the scar?
I told you to cut down on the sugar. <+++++> I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.
This is all the same creature. We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle. <+++++> Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals...
Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there. <+++++> I'll be there in 5 minutes.
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue. <+++++> As in the...?
Do you like it? <+++++> Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out. <+++++> Sorry.
Probably not. <+++++> Do you like Scotch stories?
I didn't stop to think, Clay. <+++++> You better start.
Who did? <+++++> You did!
Would you like anything? <+++++> I should like to see my drawing.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment. <+++++> I am committed. I love you.
Can anyone hear what we say? <+++++> Only Brother.
Please. It's for your own good. <+++++> You said bad things hurt places. So maybe good things heal them. Good things are happening here. Maybe for the first time ever.
The title won't do. <+++++> Ah
You sure you've done this before? <+++++> Lots of times....
Easy, mon. <+++++> Later.
The usual. Doc. <+++++> EXT. U.S. ARMY RESEARCH LABORATORY/GUARD GATE - JEROME - NIGHT.
That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there. <+++++> Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
Don't ask where I got it. <+++++> You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news. <+++++> What's the bad news?
I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it. <+++++> I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago. <+++++> You look wonderful. You do. What happened to you?
Put your arms around me. <+++++> Excuse me?
Sorry about that, hon. Enjoy your beer, and try to have a nice day. <+++++> Yeah, I'll try.
Oh, yes. <+++++> You know, I saw you once there, in London. You're a great attraction.
So? <+++++> Switek pulling this off...? That's not faith; that's delusional...
Two down, four to go. <+++++> What's that supposed to mean?
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can. <+++++> Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning. First.... thing...
Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man. A trial like this is going to put Cardenas in the spot-light. <+++++> We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet.
Yes? <+++++> If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.
Yeah. <+++++> Where do you want to go?
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer... <+++++> I won't quit !
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it. <+++++> I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down. <+++++> Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
They've been enlarged and show a lot of detail... <+++++> Splendid, love to see them.
Mom... <+++++> I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again.
Dear Veronica, Heather was your soulmate.....Share. <+++++> Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness.
That's my trick! <+++++> It's everyone's trick, Kevin. But I did pick it up from you.
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson? <+++++> Okay?
Just keep quiet. <+++++> I have to answer him.
Which boarder? Saudi? Kuwait? Syria? <+++++> Couldn't be Syria. We couldn't have gone that far north. It's got to be Saudi. Come on.
What are we? <+++++> Nothing if not vampires...
What? <+++++> Don't ask me. The guy's completely out to lunch.
And that will be a good place to end this study. <+++++> No, Malcolm! Individual performance is only part of it.
Sign this, and I will confess you myself if you want. <+++++> And may I go to Mass?
Never try to outguess Margo. <+++++> Groom.
Good night, mother, good night. <+++++> Good night...Barbara...
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard. <+++++> Her beauty fucks with your mind.
I haven't killed _you_. <+++++> Is that a threat?
Hey, where y'at, Frank? You're wasting your time here. Big Jim gave strict orders. No FBI allowed. <+++++> It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
How the fuck do you know? What is it with you and this broad anyway? <+++++> Come on, Phil. You're not gonna let this slide. What about her parents? What about what else she's published?
How have you been? <+++++> Terrific. Going on alot of dates ... seeing lots of men... lots of dates..
Aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and starboard at station keeping. Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway. <+++++> No, no. Thank you.
Charming. <+++++> Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever. It's fast acting.
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby? <+++++> Tell it with...
He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence. <+++++> Not that we know of.
No. <+++++> I want to be near you!
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty. <+++++> You're talking about the precogs...
Would you like a bite of my pie? <+++++> Yes, I would.
Cut some kind of a deal. I heard that's what Flynn's doing... <+++++> Mike Flynn's a dirty cop, Hap! We are nothing like Mike Flynn.
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I... <+++++> Relax. I know what you meant.
We could've had three weeks in Florida - all expenses paid. Lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish... <+++++> Knock it off, will you?
Okay, thank you for asking. <+++++> She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money.
You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds. <+++++> How much can you lift?
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you! <+++++> Tell me what?
Anything but the Jayer Richebourg! <+++++> She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.
You didn't grab her and try to kiss her? <+++++> No.
I was just wondering... Nick... You're going hunting... If I could use this place to stay, because... <+++++> Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
It's nice to see you. <+++++> Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
Yeah. <+++++> The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?
And when is the countdown supposed to expire? <+++++> Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
He wants me to testify? Is that what he's asking me to do? <+++++> George, he wasn't asking.
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job. <+++++> Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
 <+++++> Hey!
No, but... <+++++> But what?
Nice fellows. <+++++> Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies butÂ
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex -- <+++++> I am very sorry, ma'am. Goodbye now.
Who sought the warrant? <+++++> The man from the F.B.I.
You do this all the time, right, Charlie? <+++++> Twenty years.
Great. <+++++> Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
Candy-stripe a cancer ward. It's not my problem. <+++++> Please. Can't we do something... ?
I'm not sure I can face it. <+++++> Keep me company.
What happened to your face? <+++++> Got in a little accident.
Right. Why? <+++++> 
Charlie really has a great voice. <+++++> Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts.
No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here? <+++++> News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
Hello, everybody. I'm the bass fiddle. Just call me Daphne. <+++++> I'm Josephine. Sax.
And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence... <+++++> "Harassed." Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo? The guy's a thief, he took my...
A few days ago. <+++++> That's what I figured. Well, I have a little home coming present for you.
I'm not leaving without those stones. <+++++> You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
What? <+++++> Let's not tell our sad stories.
Leave him behind! <+++++> No! He's coming with us!
Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat... <+++++> No.
Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office? <+++++> I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
I feel really good. <+++++> How are you going to pay when you get sick?
Well... I need to see about closin'. <+++++> See about closing.
Yes, well, they are. <+++++> Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
You are such a raving pussy sometimes. <+++++> Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character.
Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but it's the first time in my life I've ever tasted life! <+++++> Splendid!
So why do you stay? <+++++> I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I? <+++++> In a quandary.
THE PRESIDENT, HOLDING THE PHOTOGRAPH <+++++> Dashes and Dots. And those dots spell out a message in the Morse Code.
No. <+++++> 
I always wanted to do that. I saw it in a movie. <+++++> What about me?
How'd you get this from her? <+++++> You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
Well, why don't ya read it. <+++++> Sir?
Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father. <+++++> Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?
So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of. <+++++> I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down.
He'll have to take a check. I couldn't find my wallet. <+++++> Yeh, he knows that.
She's very nice, apparently. Lives in Norfolk. And very left-wing. You'll have to watch yourself there. <+++++> Ha ha...
What would you like? <+++++> Something pretty.
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you? <+++++> Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
A crucifix. <+++++> Above the bed? Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different? What is it?
Boy - you hear me? ! <+++++> That'll be thirty-eight cents.
Hell. This is just like fucking Star Wars, man! <+++++> Star Wars?
Did you get married real young? <+++++> Twenty-four isn't young. I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married. I've never been with anybody but Darryl.
What is it? <+++++> It's...he was...one who came to the island with me.
Byzantine? <+++++> Basil the II.
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear. <+++++> No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
Glad to meet you. <+++++> I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor. <+++++> Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
But we fought. <+++++> Yes. Especially toward the end.
Who's who? <+++++> I'm sorry. I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
There's nothing else here. <+++++> What's the bible for?
But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you. <+++++> I am trying.
Ten thousand right here. <+++++> There must be over a million dollars in here.
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle. <+++++> Well, maybe you're right.
 <+++++> Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do? Statue of Liberty? Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix? Seduce some women?
It's illegal, Nick. <+++++> It's a new deal. ... coming with me tomorrow?
Are you my big hard hero? <+++++> Do you want me to save you? Do you want me to save you?
Thanks Lloyd. <+++++> How do you pay for one of those?
You really will? <+++++> Yes.
Christ! You do know it all! <+++++> No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
They'll lose because they're my team. <+++++> He will absolutely hate it.
Don't go! Please. <+++++> I'll be right in the other room, Newt. And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
Can we buy the Marshal some dinner? <+++++> No, I better stay at my post.
I didn't get a thing. Just the music lessons. That's all there was to it. <+++++> He married you, didn't he?
Real rain? <+++++> Yeah ... You don't have rain either?
Cal knows who he is. Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight? <+++++> You weren't exactly horrified.
Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive. <+++++> She said that?
I see. <+++++> You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar. <+++++> Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou? <+++++> Well, if that's what you want to call it. I didn't ever think it would come to this. I guess I am, boss.
I'm aware of that. <+++++> So what's it doing in Tijuana?
Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you? <+++++> Well, no, I didn't actually.
Nothing. <+++++> Nothing's wrong.
I find that unlikely. <+++++> Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care. I'd weather blizzards to have you.
Don't you like her? <+++++> Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water. <+++++> We'll come up with the next big thing.
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends! You'll die out there. <+++++> Maybe.
What about the sender? <+++++> Sure. Bettina Peterson. Marfa, Texas. Let's run a current check.
May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ?? ? <+++++> To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
They have six tentacles. A new species. And the squid too. They had no stomach. <+++++> Wait a minute.
That's why I'm here. <+++++> Coming with me will be a delicate matter. We will work it out. But Charlie...
Are you all right? <+++++> OWW...MAN...
You know it's a trap. <+++++> Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
What makes you think that? <+++++> Your eyes told me.
Any chance of getting me out on bail? <+++++> What is bail?
How does a guy get a rep like that? <+++++> Doesn't matter to me. If I went down in history like Adams, I'd die happy. All they say about him today is --
The Feds would be onto you in a month. <+++++> Not with these bills. And even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be?
Do you want me to get it? <+++++> You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Here comes the Times Drama Critic. <+++++> Watch closely, as Bialystock drives the last nail into the coffin.
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged? <+++++> Your parents met her.
 <+++++> So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
As in the...? <+++++> As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.
You got a suitcase? <+++++> Never needed one. I've never been anywhere. I've got a backpack.
Just like old times. <+++++> Just like old times?
First Lady... <+++++> Don't worry. You won't even see her.
Here. <+++++> What's that?
Frances. <+++++> Where's Clifford?
But she's right there! I must feel her! <+++++> You can't.
How did you get into the business? <+++++> The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in? <+++++> That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
Which you pulled, hard! <+++++> That was code for "I like you."
What's that? <+++++> You joined up.
What are you running away from? <+++++> Why do you ask that?
Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now. <+++++> I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
You're a genius, Babe - a genius! <+++++> I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
Stay? They lived together all their years? <+++++> Oh, yes... I think...
You have more experience at this than I do. <+++++> Yes.
I will close. John, John, ten percent. I can get hot. You know that... <+++++> Not lately you can't...
I can't do it. <+++++> What kind of man are you?
Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue? <+++++> No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it?
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie. <+++++> Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
Hi. Hey. <+++++> Kat.
I am going over here. <+++++> God damn, you people are confusing.
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together. <+++++> Two tourists who never went home.
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie. <+++++> Aw, Eddie.
You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind? <+++++> Like...?
It's been a long time, Ma. <+++++> Yes. I supposed you still have that old phone booth.
You deaf or what? <+++++> Gotta go. See ya soon. Everybody happy now?
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains. To take that step to the right... <+++++> But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
Let's go. <+++++> Anything you say, baby.
Door was open. <+++++> Which door?
It's a lovely town Â- it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened. <+++++> Kiki, Galbraith said something to me once, -- something you ought to know.
...but... <+++++> You got a dime....?
I guess I've come to quite a place. <+++++> Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
Nesting? <+++++> Yeah. Nesting.
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission. <+++++> Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
Didn't you study it in school? <+++++> Only in theory. You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter? Not in theory -- in practice.
And who kills in the manner of his victim. <+++++> That information's being withheld from the media.
Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before. It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it? <+++++> Yes.
Hey, what'd you do that for? <+++++> Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground. <+++++> 
What? <+++++> Just one kiss. For old times' sake.
Socially... I'll have a beer. <+++++> So you admit you just lied?
I'm not sure. <+++++> Do you like me even a little bit?
But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me. <+++++> Oh, Wade.
Ready. <+++++> Your hair's a little funny.
Oh, it's a fire hydrant. <+++++> Yes. It's Asta's Christmas present.
Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk? <+++++> You can't bluff me any more.
Rob here. <+++++> Hey. It's Liz.
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died. <+++++> Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something... <+++++> You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
With this guy locked in? <+++++> Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there.
Guess I did. <+++++> Haven't slept, have you?
Finished or unfinished? <+++++> It was perfect, George. Amazing. It was so real.
Then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about. <+++++> I guess not.
Gary, you're quite an animal. <+++++> Screw you...
Oh, now I'll never get home! <+++++> Stay with us, then, Dorothy. We all love you. We don't want you to go.
I wish I could stick it out like you. I just, with Trish and the kids... <+++++> Don't do this, Hap...
Tried it for six months and almost freaked. Makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds... <+++++> Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
No. <+++++> Liar?
Good for you. Why shouldnÂt you protect whatÂs yours. <+++++> I donÂt think youÂre hearing me.
Yes. <+++++> Who was your primary beneficiary?
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken. <+++++> I tell you, I saw them!
See them birds? Most times I wouldn't even notice them birds much. But I'm noticin' 'em real good 'cause I thought I was dead. <+++++> I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
My crew is going to work alongside with your men, don't worry--we're a team! <+++++> Why should I worry? Is there a problem?
If you can just wait a few more minutes. <+++++> Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder!
Nothing, nothing at all. <+++++> I mean...with your car.
And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri. <+++++> Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
If that is your destiny. <+++++> Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
Shit, Dude, I didn't know. I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby. <+++++> We're sorry, man. We're really sorry.
Don't we? <+++++> No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds.
YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE <+++++> TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`
It's not in their blood the way it is for Catwoman...Where is she? <+++++> I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night.
I guess not. <+++++> Give you three minutes.
You're a deep one. <+++++> In that case give us the articles. We'll sign at once. We know all the details...
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon. <+++++> Can you move over a wee bit?
Yes, Ma. <+++++> And you... should be proud. You won that contest and made a name for yourself.
Fine, Chief. <+++++> Gimme the keys.
We got to go back. We got to go back for Wes. <+++++> Forget Wes.
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us. <+++++> I don't know who we are anymore.
Yes, thank you. <+++++> How are the kids?
I said you're soft. <+++++> Don't call me that. You know I hate it when you call me that.
What's funny? <+++++> Morpheus. He almost had me convinced.
Yeah, but it was shot. <+++++> I didn't tell you to do it! You can't just do unauthorized work.
Good Lord! <+++++> A shelldweller. They live in the outer shell of the city. Quite unique, there have been two here before. They smell.
How about this? <+++++> Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.
No, not really. <+++++> Interesting.
She watches... she listens. <+++++> Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
Why you always gotta embarrass me? I been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me! <+++++> They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data? <+++++> In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them. <+++++> My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
George, you promised. No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes... <+++++> I call them the MTV.I.A. Punks think Bay of Pigs is an herbal tea. They think the Cold War involves penguins and...
Then answer my questions. Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here? <+++++> New York.
Why you're here? <+++++> ... Yeah.
Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own? <+++++> I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?
The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice... <+++++> Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.
Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.' <+++++> They still have to take it to a jury.
But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha. <+++++> The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids.
I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde. <+++++> Edgar, think twice. He works in the kitchen.
Jacques, my friend, how are you? <+++++> Enzo...
When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it. <+++++> I can't understand that fancy talk. You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
Yeah? <+++++> Yeah. I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Sorry to keep you waiting. <+++++> Don't worry. It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20. Do you read me, bomb? <+++++> Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback. Roger, I read you, continue.
I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff. <+++++> Figure she's with him?
What's your point, Lothar? <+++++> Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.
Brown, Jackie Brown. <+++++> What does she do for you?
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any. <+++++> Carla Jean, I will not harm your man. And he needs help, whether he knows it or not.
Adamant. <+++++> What?
It has a killer refresh rate. <+++++> P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later...  Come here. <+++++> I'm not sure... I don't know.
That boy wants me to. <+++++> All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum. <+++++> What in the world are you talking about? Six ounces -- ?
Fifteen yards. <+++++> That's fifteen by seven?
It was you, wasn't it? <+++++> It was me, what?
All they want to do is regulate our natural growth! It's happening across the country! <+++++> To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die. <+++++> I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh?
 <+++++> Neat.
Lemme guess. The lottery. <+++++> Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.
You don't have a piece of the action? <+++++> Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
Over here. I want you to meet somebody. <+++++> Lucky. Lucky, lucky, lucky.
But we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop. Do you hear me? <+++++> Yes, sir.
I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you? <+++++> I'm thirty-four.
No, not her. Me. <+++++> Who's you?
I was supposed to have this car back three days ago. It's not my car. <+++++> I know that.
Huh? Oh, good, good. <+++++> Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles.
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done? <+++++> Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.
Look, he's temperamental. <+++++> Yeah, what if I am? What about it?
I never was no good with history. <+++++> No, I mean your past. About why you were in here. I'll take you first thing in the mornin'.
Sit down for a second. <+++++> No.
What are you going to do? <+++++> What I've always done.
At college. <+++++> Yes.
Mick. Mick. Mick... <+++++> What?
I gotta get back to Cushman. <+++++> Okay, I understand. I'll boil it down for ya. Fuck Nike. All they do is ignore me...
Shit. <+++++> You have to put things in perspective.
Now don't you think it's time you told me all about yourself? <+++++> I have a mother and her name is Rebecca -- My father's name is Nathan Lee Morgan, and...
When did I ever? <+++++> This man down at the Drugstore...
Care for a smoke? <+++++> This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
What's that? <+++++> He calls me sport one more time, and I'll blow a watermelon-sized hole through him.
I'm sorry about my parents. <+++++> You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
No, Doctor. She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back -- <+++++> How long after that was the paralysis complete?
Chief? Mike said a young girl answered the door. <+++++> Did he say if she was shooting at him?
And they all came... <+++++> Yes.
Stop it. <+++++> Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
No. He had the choice. <+++++> What choice!! ?
Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but -- <+++++> That's why.
That's Greene. He's supporting our reconsolidation. <+++++> Marquis! Get these men reformed, send Steuben and Wayne out on the left...
Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath. <+++++> I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman.
Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female. <+++++> I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men.
They aren't answering their hails. <+++++> This doesn't make sense.
What'll I tell him? <+++++> Tell him you're going to elope with him.
"Dad?" Dad. The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country. <+++++> England?
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon. <+++++> Miss Packard. How do you do?
No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be --  -- a man that eats fire? <+++++> Guess there will, if it says so.
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up. <+++++> Why?
Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise. <+++++> Fine by me. We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
In English. I'll fuck your brains out. <+++++> What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
Susie... I... <+++++> You don't have to say anything, Daniel. I'm a scientist. I know what's happening. I recognize the classic symptoms.
I don't want to go back. <+++++> This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
Finish your prayers? <+++++> Finish yours?
But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay. <+++++> No. You just do shit for me right now.
Where are you going? <+++++> I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
No, no. Easier, quicker, more seductive. <+++++> But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
I'm sorry, I been real busy. <+++++> You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.
Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault? <+++++> I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it.
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand? <+++++> No, I did not.
Maybe you shouldn't come everyday. <+++++> No. Why? I like to be with Sam.
Who was the friend? <+++++> Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
And how do we release the power? <+++++> The legend goes that you release the power with the power.
If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you. <+++++> Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from?
It's her! I'm telling you. She whispered and turned on the music. She's trying to contact me! <+++++> It's a ghost.
That'll get us into El Paso, which is right next to the border. We'll stop at a motel -- <+++++> Stop? We're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we?
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking -- <+++++> Linda... Hey, Linda...
Jesse, we got to have a word. <+++++> Sure, cousin.
I don't think so, he should be along soon... <+++++> I wish he were here...
Taller, Viktor. <+++++> Taller? What?
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember? <+++++> How much do you make a week?
Yeah. All over. <+++++> Call all of them from here to Anchorage.
And how would you know that? <+++++> Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study.
Meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster? <+++++> What's your problem?
I'm so hungry. <+++++> Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
No ... And they won't take my calls ... <+++++> What does that mean -- ?
He's already dead. <+++++> He is, eh? I'll take a look. Bring him in.
Mr. President. <+++++> Admiral Donald...Bill...
I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners -- <+++++> You lived like this once.
Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police. <+++++> It will all be over in such a little while, Jacqueline, and everything will be all right again. Drink your coffee.
You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess! <+++++> You are the Princess.
Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something? <+++++> Not today. Where are your friends?
That's not him. <+++++> Yes, it is. It's him. Cameron, Cameron, come on over.Yo!
You left her. How's that for a fact? <+++++> How's this for a fact? I loved her first.
Kate... <+++++> Ummm?
You should know how it works. Just in case. <+++++> In case you die, too?
 <+++++> First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying? <+++++> I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
Junior gave it to me. It must have at least thirty stones - <+++++> Thirty-four.
Just barely, sir. <+++++> I'm going down to the station.
Of course. <+++++> What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
Is Jody still awake? <+++++> She just turned off her light.
Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps? <+++++> Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...
Where we going? <+++++> Quick drop. In and out.
What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who... <+++++> Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day...
You shouldn't get mixed up in this. <+++++> Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?
I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me. <+++++> Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA <+++++> If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke? <+++++> Aye.
All right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! What can she say? <+++++> But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her.
The G-man? <+++++> Zackly.
They're playin' the Buckeyes! <+++++> Yah.
Let's get us a photo and description. We'll have an APB out while we stake out the restaurant. <+++++> That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
It is a living thing. When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself. <+++++> That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
You must be some kinda walker, Henry. <+++++> Hejira.
Who are you? <+++++> Hooper, Matt Hooper. From the Oceanographic Institute.
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested. <+++++> Your Lisa?
What? Wait a minute... talk to me. <+++++> Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
And he was with her. <+++++> We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
To beat us. We can't let them do it. We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together. <+++++> That's what you said the first time we met. You didn't even know me.
Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ... It's a lovely calf. <+++++> You're right, Mary it's a fine calf. That's why Stevens'll take it for the rest of the payment.
Baby, I'll call you tomorrow. <+++++> What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.
Jesus Christ. <+++++> Call Wydell.
I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do. Are you happily married? <+++++> What?
Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.' Do you see? <+++++> Yes...
Where are they? <+++++> You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
Oh, terrific. <+++++> It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
What are you talking about? <+++++> He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off.
Sixty-five, ninety-four-- <+++++> Don't you <u>realize</u>--
Four plus Myers. <+++++> How many bodies did you find?
Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man. <+++++> Follow the Rich White Man?
Shhh... don't talk. <+++++> I want to talk. I just learned again.
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began! <+++++> That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
No. <+++++> Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.
What do you think? Good move? <+++++> Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him. <+++++> Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
Don't give a damn about the famous girl. <+++++> No, don't think I do.
It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this? <+++++> Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob. <+++++> Well, not quite a blood-thirsty mob.
Yes, it was -- I ended up -- <+++++> No need to make excuses --
What did you find? <+++++> Evidence of a massive infection.
Like the dress...? <+++++> ItÂs lovely...
Most definitely. <+++++> Better sooner than later.
Really? You're such a talented actor. <+++++> Thanks.
Are you in the service? <+++++> The postal service. I'm a mailman.
I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over. <+++++> Yeah.
He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination. <+++++> Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. <+++++> Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
We lost ... <+++++> I know ...
I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk. I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats. <+++++> Cats?
Go! <+++++> ... idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on!
This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK! <+++++> Cut it out, before you break something!
Come in. <+++++> Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
Saddest thing I ever heard. <+++++> Not at all. It taught me a little sense. I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic.
Oh, fine. <+++++> Not on your feet too much?
About my daughter? <+++++> No I didn't know you had one.
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes. <+++++> But the Jacket? I mean...should we be leaving him in like that?
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me? <+++++> No.
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ... <+++++> I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me. <+++++> Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer. <+++++> I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.
Have you ever done that before? Pulled someone into your dream? <+++++> When I was a little girl. Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in.
Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . . <+++++> Yeah ÂÂ yeah ÂÂ hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
Not at all. <+++++> I just though you were awful cute.
I'm not sure I do, Archie. <+++++> There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened. <+++++> Think it'll work?
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise. <+++++> But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir. <+++++> Gold, eh?
Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it. <+++++> Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
I can hear you good. Can you hear me? <+++++> Yes. Yes, I can hear you.
I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her. <+++++> Yeah, but, I -- I've been working a lot lately, and -- No, that's not it.
Oh Lord! <+++++> That fool. That damn fool.
I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos. <+++++> That woulda been cool.
Indy? Did you talk to them? <+++++> Yes.
I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me-- <+++++> Now, look, kid--if we're gonna wonder, let's go down and do it over a hunk of steak.
No. <+++++> Why not?
People now have dignity when frying eggs? <+++++> They don't have to feel like slaves.
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it. <+++++> And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
We been going four years. Four years...my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister. <+++++> I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
Ah. One of the supporting characters. <+++++> Who?
Harry's missing. <+++++> What do you mean, he's missing?
Shall we have another? <+++++> No thanks. Not tonight if you don't mind.
Still stuck on her, huh. <+++++> Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
You have no right to blame Duval -- <+++++> That line was tampered with...
I need to start getting the feel of it all, right? Meet the people. <+++++> I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone. I can't help wondering... why here?
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas? <+++++> None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
Thanks, Melvin. <+++++> Welcome.
Gordon Liddy, you mean? <+++++> 
Help me get him to the boat. <+++++> Leave him.
What flowers? <+++++> The bouquet, here. Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow.
You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about. <+++++> No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.
I always liked him. Especially last year in Munich ... <+++++> Last year? It can't be that long.
Yeah, very big, a giant. <+++++> I didn't have a dad... never saw him... never even heard him.
Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get "some". <+++++> Some what?
Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz. <+++++> It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.
He flatters me so I'll help him with Latin. <+++++> And English, and trig
I really donÂt like that comparison, honey. <+++++> He hates Oliver Stone.
Does that make it right... <+++++> Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love.
What's the matter? <+++++> My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
Got to finish this thesis sometime. <+++++> How about lunch?
Then what the hell are you talking about? <+++++> Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now. That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.
He's not? <+++++> No. Sybok has simply put us in touch with feelings we've always been afraid to express.
I won. <+++++> I wanted you to.
But I always eat like this. <+++++> Either you're European or badly brought up.
Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all. <+++++> I'll find her.
No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore? <+++++> I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
Al? Al, you there? <+++++> I'm here, cowboy.
Is that too much, Baron? <+++++> No -- not at all.
Don't you want it? <+++++> Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough. Besides, I want you to have it.
We left them eighty-eights. <+++++> They don't send planes to put out machine guns. Two flank runners with surpressing fire.
We've certainly missed you. <+++++> Birdy, I've been doing a lot of thinking. There are a lot of things that haven't worked out for me.
Why? <+++++> I put a lot of effort into these things.
No, think of something else. <+++++> Sean, this is ridiculous. You're acting very immature.
It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you. <+++++> Thank you, sir. But I expect a certain amount of pain.
Alex, what are you doing? <+++++> Shut up, you slut. You think you can take him from me? Well, over my dead body.
Would somebody fill me in? <+++++> He went into the pyramid alone. We lost radio contact with him. When we pulled him out, it was on his face.
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit. Right from the start. <+++++> He said that, too.
...What? <+++++> I said, how ya feelin'?
If I didn't try and destroy that... I couldn't live here or anywhere. Do you understand? <+++++> I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want.
Who is it? <+++++> He won't give his name.
Yeah. Lenny. I have. <+++++> It didn't stop you from loving them. Right? Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
A black bull came. <+++++> A black bull!
 <+++++> What?! What do you mean, I don't understand.
Later. Let's go... <+++++> Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy! <+++++> Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type.
It means he's a guy. You can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring at their reflections. <+++++> A girl after your own heart, Ted.
Not being partial, are you? <+++++> No, I'm not. I'm not!
Why? Are they what's most important? <+++++> No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
China. <+++++> Oh, my God. I never told anybody about this. I remember the one about the peasant, too. God, there's a bunch.
It was supposed to be. Dad had a heart attack, two days ago. <+++++> How is he - ?
Who? <+++++> You know who.
Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these? Who am I? <+++++> I don't know.
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package? <+++++> I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
I have a television. <+++++> NO--!
I got to go. I'm late. <+++++> Call me tomorrow.
I'll talk to you on this. I want to find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back. <+++++> Certainly. Anything I can do to be of service.
How can I make your life better? <+++++> I know you say to take the Arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition. _ 25.
He's not the story! There's a source behind him. <+++++> Who?
I'm sorry if I let you down. <+++++> You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down.
Sure plan to. <+++++> He have any special dietary requirements...?
Dude, do you know what you're doing? <+++++> No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
He was upset with moving, I believe. <+++++> Is that all he said?
I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh? <+++++> Pretty weird.
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma? <+++++> Oh, sure. Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
You've been alone together? <+++++> Yes.
Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off! ! <+++++> You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you? !
Yeah. I told him I'd be there before five. <+++++> Excellent. I'll go down with you.
Emily, you're being - a little unfair -  You know what I think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives - <+++++> There aren't any personal lives for people like us.
Do you want to learn or not? <+++++> I guess. It still sounds gross.
Get the presents and do the lights. <+++++> You bet.
I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry! How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ? <+++++> Stop it!
It is. <+++++> Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery. A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.
They weren't human! <+++++> Come on. What were they, Jake?
Yes. <+++++> To the foot doctor.
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass? <+++++> Women?
Jabez -- ? <+++++> I've brought you something to keep you warm, Mrs. Stone --
I can't feel her bones. She's like a sponge. <+++++> She was crushed. Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
Is that what it is? Dollars? Money? I'll pay for it. Take it out of my salary. <+++++> You don't make enough.
Okay, darling. <+++++> You'd say if you mind?
Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man. <+++++> You not ugly.
Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them. <+++++> Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
Yeah. <+++++> Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman. <+++++> Oh no.
Once is enough, thank you. <+++++> He saved our lives.
She's being called for. <+++++> You said you'd call my father.
Can't I take it for you? <+++++> No, thank you. Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.
Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him. <+++++> Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
Do you want me to pet your head? <+++++> I bet you want your head scratched.
Some setup you got here. A real, honest-to-goodness love nest. <+++++> Sssssh.
I don't like you. I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience. <+++++> Don't say that.
Hey! Where'd you guys go? <+++++> Left, goddamnit!
Pow. <+++++> Pow?
Bobby, you've been dreaming again. <+++++> No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!
But you escaped. <+++++> I was lucky. The others weren't.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations? <+++++> There is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location.
What are you talking about? <+++++> Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
Look, humor the old man -- just be careful. <+++++> I'll be careful. I'll see y'later.
He never asked me for nothin'. <+++++> He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
Like what? <+++++> Sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial...
You didn't go telling your father you were here? <+++++> Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari. You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford? <+++++> That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
Thank you. I'll bet you need to -- <+++++> Yes.
Even better. <+++++> Even cosier.
--and we will-- <+++++> And the ocean! A mountain range!
Egg Foo Young. Stand up. <+++++> What?
Its called insubordination. <+++++> Then why do I still have a badge?
So am I. <+++++> Come on, Watson, we're going places.
And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone...  Lifesaver? <+++++> You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember? <+++++> Sorry... I was distracted.
I would say we are now officially baffled. <+++++> On national television.
Wow. Did he go to jail? <+++++> He fled. They still can't find him. My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store. <+++++> Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
Friend of mine, owns a club. Dickie Randall. You'd know him if you saw him. His brother was in your class. Terry. <+++++> You didn't say what it was for, did you?
Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him. <+++++> Who?
Nguyen. He twelve now. Not see him for eight years. <+++++> Where's his father?
No. I'll take a strega. <+++++> What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
Oh... well, I... I just had to see you. <+++++> Okay, you've seen me. Now give me a towel.
Oh, Lydia! <+++++> Lydia. Lydia what?
Positive. <+++++> Did you do everything I asked you to?
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect. <+++++> I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax. <+++++> May I have the surgeon's name, please?
Who did cause and origin? <+++++> Who do you think, Chief? !
I thought we were goin' to a movie. <+++++> I think we just need to get wasted.
Let's get a drink. <+++++> Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
You've been a naughty boy haven't you? C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty. <+++++> Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom. <+++++> We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
...<u>nothing</u>... <+++++> Precisely.
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon -- <+++++> It's three a.m. I'm not supposed to be here. I snuck out --
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh? <+++++> Uh, yessir.
American. <+++++> Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?
Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that... <+++++> Boss, then I'm afraid I can't continue working with Bill.
Your parents are divorced? <+++++> Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
Find out who "A.D." is. I got a quick errand to run. <+++++> Sounds good.
Yes, sir. <+++++> And I will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the President. John Paul Jones... you don't understand a thing, do you, Admiral?
Terry? What do you want? <+++++> Hey look-
Sharp bank, Chewie. Let's turn this bucket around. You heard me, turn around! Full power on the front shield. <+++++> You're going to attack them?!! !
Hey, Frank. <+++++> You recognized me.
Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black. You're absolutely correct. The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love. <+++++> Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
I should have torn that door off its hinges. Should have scrogged her ears off. Should have broken the bed. What do you want? Well? <+++++> I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
What's it like where I'm going? <+++++> Can you keep a secret?
I wish I hadn't heard -- <+++++> Why? Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that. Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
It didn't work, Vince. <+++++> You were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot.
I don't know. <+++++> I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon.
Tell me what he said. <+++++> He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
That's what you're supposed to say. <+++++> This is not a coy deception. I do not want to be scrogged. I want love. I want tenderness.
You bet. <+++++> I'm outta here.
These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad. <+++++> Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
Fuck you. <+++++> Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested. <+++++> WellÂof all theÂwellÂ  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
You always do. <+++++> Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit --
Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too. <+++++> You had a rough couple years, that's all.
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont. <+++++> She told you that?
Please. <+++++> It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.
Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know.... <+++++> Yes?
Heather? <+++++> Chase. Hi...
What's he like? <+++++> Oh, I don't know. You have to get to know him. He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.
Well? Continue! Continue! <+++++> Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
Why did you call me? The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you. <+++++> Gosh. Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
Greetings fellow insomniac. <+++++> Greetings fellow sheep counter.
You look like an orange worm. <+++++> Shark bait. Draws them over for closeups.
Please, Jill ... I love you. <+++++> Go away.
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately. <+++++> You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
I said I just wanted to talk to you... <+++++> That's cool.
Really? <+++++> Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.
We should go! We should go right now! <+++++> He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
Mr. Bond! Nice to see you. <+++++> Sir Elliot.
I'm so glad you're here. <+++++> I understand.
Disease? What disease? <+++++> Abstraction. They're obsessed with abstraction.
My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him... <+++++> I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
<i>We gotta bring him in.</i> <+++++> Will you speak the fucking English language? The poor girl has no clue what you're talking about. The boy speaks English, you know.
Womack ripped it up, right? <+++++> You knew? All this time?
Where are we? <+++++> Finsbury Park. WeÂre in Finsbury Park.
Again? <+++++> Yes, if you like. Call me at work.
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears. In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa. <+++++> Own the desert.
Bring some ice cream, I'm burning up. Do you love me? <+++++> Do I love you?
I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch. <+++++> It's impossible.
It's good medicine. <+++++> A little homeopathic cure for the willies.
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us. <+++++> Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.
I was tired. I needed a coffee. <+++++> What about Kanita?
Food for crows. <+++++> Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
Sweet Grace? What about her? <+++++> About what you said this morning.
You were terrific, too! <+++++> Hey. It's raining.
OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it. <+++++> Where are his pants?
Here you go, enjoy. <+++++> I hope this was made with egg whites!
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here. <+++++> Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was still alive. He's gone. Time for a new deal.
Yeah. <+++++> You just need to get more organized. L
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs? <+++++> Certainly, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.
Honey, just leave it. <+++++> No, there's...
Maxine. <+++++> Not the Maxine?
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means? <+++++> No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
Thanks. Jeez. Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number. <+++++> You're off the hook, Ozzie. But Batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.
I'll drive you -- <+++++> Ben.
She's not a... <+++++> Lesbian? No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property. <+++++> Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.
Really? <+++++> I know that you're recruiting your old henchmen...
Dr STECKLER? <+++++> Yes...?
Death. <+++++> What about death?
The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans. I just hacked into it. <+++++> Congratulations.
Stan and I're okay. <+++++> Yah.
Pussy. <+++++> What's that -- mistake number two, Norman?
Yeah. She left with some bikers Big ones. Full of sperm. <+++++> Funny.
I couldn't help it! It just popped in there! <+++++> What? What popped in there?
I want children. <+++++> You've just decided, is that right?
I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary. <+++++> No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know. <+++++> It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it.
Can you? <+++++> Sure I can, can't I?
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody. <+++++> I wouldn't let happen.
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight. <+++++> They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
Professor, that girl you were talking about -- <+++++> Hey. You: think twice --
We're police officers. <+++++> You're foreigners.
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet. <+++++> Of course.
Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible. <+++++> See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --
Show me where you buried her. <+++++> I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
Yeah, twice. <+++++> What happened?
What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder? <+++++> Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
What are you going to do? <+++++> He's expecting my call. I'm going to the station...  And I'm going to call him.
Chicken? <+++++> I bet you see right through me, don't you?
What's to see? <+++++> What's on the ClockCam?
The Rosatos are running crazy; taking hostages, spitting in my face, because they're backed by the Jew in Miami. <+++++> I know. That's why I want you to be fair with them.
And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich. <+++++> Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
What should we get? <+++++> I don't care. You pick.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys -- <+++++> Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
How old do I look? <+++++> Twenty-five? Around there.
I'm tellin' yuh. <+++++> So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
Why would he take it? He don't even know you. <+++++> Shut up! Where's that other miyatea?
Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand. <+++++> That's not what we were taught. 'Look out for number one' -- that's daddy's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold.
He's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking. <+++++> From the neighborhood? Shut the fuck up. You like telephones? Huh?. You wanta go for a ride?
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China. <+++++> Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him. <+++++> We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
Why's that? <+++++> You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.
That's just insecurity. <+++++> I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century. <+++++> I didn't get you?
Perhaps the police? <+++++> I know cops -- and you're no cop.
-- sort of a boyfriend? <+++++> Sort of.
But... <+++++> It will be human and it will look like this. But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know.
Attrition. When you regret your sins, but not because you love God. <+++++> Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore. <+++++> I know that. I know what's at stake here...
You're with me now. <+++++> Yeah.
Good to see you, son. Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you? <+++++> It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right. <+++++> Why do they bother him on a day like this?
They're going to rob that bank. <+++++> How do you know?
See, I'm going home. <+++++> Ah yes. Of course. To the girl who waits.
Don't! <+++++> It might be for me.
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration. <+++++> So shoot him. Won't have to feed him that way --
That's just lovely. <+++++> Thank you...
I'll bet. <+++++> I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
I'd have to be really dumb to do that. <+++++> Going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that's your alibi.
You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to - <+++++> You won't be lonely, Charles...
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...! Want to see me do it? <+++++> We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
Damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him. I swear that dog's an idiot. <+++++> Is he gonna be okay?
...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf... <+++++> Fine. You want me to call your supervisor?
So what made you think it was? <+++++> It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
You should always look to the back too, kid. <+++++> I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight. <+++++> I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him?
No You mean...? <+++++> Uh-huh.
No touch. No touch. No touch. <+++++> You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude.
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders. <+++++> I also answer to whistles.
You got a name? <+++++> Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
God knows I would, sir, but I have a previous engagement this evening. <+++++> And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?
Yes? <+++++> May I come in?
Well what about the new Echo -- <+++++> Do not get ahead of yourself.
I'll tell you the effect! It pisses me off! <+++++> Then my theory was correct.
Does it have any favorites? <+++++> It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules. <+++++> You can tell that from here?
Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with! <+++++> Wolfi! Your father is dead.
Mrs. Peel? <+++++> What kept you?
Radar! <+++++> All you have to do is ask. The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty.
When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather. <+++++> Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
A pleasure to torment me? <+++++> No -- a pride to know that I can force you to my will.
Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world. <+++++> Projecting joy is not my job.
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences. <+++++> What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
Maybe it is. Why don't you take a little stroll and see? <+++++> Fuck you, too. Pardon my French.
Great! <+++++> Woody! The rocket!
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready.... <+++++> You're ready now.
Jawohl. <+++++> Then droppen Sie dead!
I know you. <+++++> You know my back.
Are you all right? <+++++> Now look what you've done.
Who's looking for you? <+++++> Go now.
Simple math, Buzz. Two plus two does not equal three. <+++++> Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
Me name is Finn, me brother is called Francie - <+++++> But you're Irish!
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours. <+++++> You think they're strange?
This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us... <+++++> What's the matter with you, Spooky, my most trusted comrade? We are warriors! These are the challenges we live for!
Yeah, I KNOW what I said! But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen! <+++++> Sure it is. Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's.
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis? <+++++> I feel much better. Thank you.
I was trying not to tell you... <+++++> What?
Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night. <+++++> We have that all figured out.
So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant. <+++++> What? !
Y'know what? <+++++> What?
Okay. Yeah. What time? <+++++> Eight?
Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill. <+++++> You want to work at Carl's?
Well, can't we kill it? I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him. <+++++> We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it. At least right now it's keeping him alive.
Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie. <+++++> I'm sorry, too. Wow. That only took us between years to say.
I passed out. <+++++> You did.
That's nice. You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning. <+++++> Tomorrow's Saturday. Anyway, she's dead.
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired. <+++++> Llewelyn?
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds? <+++++> You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know me. <+++++> I'd like to.
Six. <+++++> Got any plans?
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening. <+++++> You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
Created? <+++++> You wouldn't understand. We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
 <+++++> I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
I couldn't face telling you. <+++++> You couldn't face telling me what?
Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad. <+++++> Yeah?
Please, Susan! I need help! Something is wrong with me! <+++++> Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
Hurry, Norman. Four minutes. <+++++> I heard! I heard!
I didn't tell you everything. <+++++> The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this. <+++++> How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?
Yes. <+++++> I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary.
Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding. <+++++> For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage. <+++++> And the carrying charges?
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back. <+++++> I don't do that kind of thing.
Owwwaaaa -- fuck me! Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit! AAAAaa! Goddd! <+++++> Does it hurt?
Frankly, yes. <+++++> Please... I'd like to go...
Chut up! <+++++> Go back to China, bitch!
If you're still up, we can talk, okay? <+++++> Sure.
You don't. It goes to court now. <+++++> He wouldn't just turn himself in. It doesn't make any sense.
Oh, shit. <+++++> Back up! Back...
Did you like her to watch? <+++++> Do you think I told her to kill You?
Oh? <+++++> I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years. What a marvelous program. Innovative. Inspiring. You are to be commended.
Yeah. <+++++> I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper. <+++++> Sid, you don't have to.
Feeling better? <+++++> I just can't believe it.
What do you do with your time? <+++++> I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind.
Why doesn't it scare you? <+++++> I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen. <+++++> We?
Were you supposed to have a session? <+++++> No. It's sort of spur of the moment.
If they find you here they will kill you. <+++++> You can bring them with a word.
Oh, don't be a doo-doo. <+++++> Not much point to this, is there?
I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number? <+++++> Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
Smitty. <+++++> Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
Sshh... it's okay. <+++++> Or even a good porno.
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms? <+++++> Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
I didn't hear nothin' till last night. <+++++> Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
With gestures, of course. <+++++> For once, to write something and have it realized completely. For once, not to compromise-
Can I help you? <+++++> I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?
You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage. <+++++> I must say you're persistent--  --it's kind of flattering.
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep <+++++> I know, just let me sleep
Does he have to be here in our hair? <+++++> Why, has he bothered you before?
Who is that? <+++++> A real swinger. He's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years.
You dance so beautifully together. <+++++> And you look so lovely.
Okay. okay. <+++++> Goodnight.
Hello, guys. <+++++> Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us.
Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago. And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son! <+++++> Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
Well, don't have kittens. Genesis is going to work. They'll remember  you in a wreath with Newton, Einstein, Surak... <+++++> Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring --
I don't have the answers anyway... and this is probably not what you want to hear right now, because you're a little upset with Ace. <+++++> I do.
You don't have to say that. <+++++> Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one. <+++++> What are you talking about, Bob?
Are you okay? <+++++> Yeah...fine.
BREAKING OUT <+++++> BREAKING OUT
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl? <+++++> Yes, thank you, sir.
I'm on the phone. <+++++> It's important.
So he's won. <+++++> No.
And you'll never see me again. Promise me. <+++++> Okay.
Can I give you a lift? <+++++> Oh, no thanks.
Don't tip. <+++++> Monster. If we're working together here, we gotta be working together.
Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh? <+++++> Sure.
You flirt with me, then you run cold. You lead me on, then slap me down. I don't go for being jerked around. <+++++> Really? And what game did you want to play? You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good. <+++++> I forgive you.
Thanks. <+++++> Not at all.
No, I wanna kill my boss! <+++++> Get the hell outta here. You sick bastard.
What are you talking about? <+++++> Nothing. That's all I can say.
You can't marry my mom. <+++++> It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
What do we do? <+++++> Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
I know, it's the hardest thing in the world, and it seems everybody wants... <+++++> ...yes...
I'm engaged. <+++++> Congratulations. Who's the lucky girl?
And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change. <+++++> Yes, Mother. G'night.
Adele... are you serious? <+++++> You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
Half past eleven. <+++++> At night?
Hello? <+++++> Lena?
Ooops. <+++++> Ooops.
Tons and tons. <+++++> Where is Sidney's father?
Can you use a new suit for Christmans? <+++++> Whatta you got?
God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it. <+++++> Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.
Would you mind if we just called it an early night? <+++++> You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
Well, I think I had one once. <+++++> You did?
Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene. <+++++> Shhh, please, Miss. Keep it down...
That's conservative, of course. There's no reason to speculate wildly. <+++++> I've never been a rich man. I hear it's nice. Is it nice?
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador. <+++++> We have many splendidly deep mines in our country.
We're going to have to reconfigure. <+++++> How long?
Jack. <+++++> Let's get it over with.
Who cares? Chicks are for fags. <+++++> I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
I'd be real careful if I were you. <+++++> It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back.
What shape is the scar? <+++++> The shape of a Three.
ML? <+++++> What?
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later? <+++++> Sooner is better than later!
Reach for the sky! ! <+++++> Huh?
And... does the voice come back? <+++++> For others, yes... For you, who knows?
No. <+++++> Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. I did cheat on that exam at Groton.
Why did you take your stuff from the office? <+++++> I didn't want to leave it there...
We did it with the best intentions... <+++++> We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions. Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess!... Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy!
I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb... <+++++> ...where they get all the really good porno channels on cable.
15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch. <+++++> 25 kilos each, huh?
Me, too. But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks. <+++++> That's a plan.
No. <+++++> Where is she? !
I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years... <+++++> "Whereas once I was blind, now I can see." Night, Nick. Best of luck.
What's up? <+++++> Sit down.
Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit... <+++++> Thank you.
So she's honest. <+++++> Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho. But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster. <+++++> Out!
Oh man...I don't know. I'm gonna miss being disreputable. <+++++> Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any better I'll always think of you that way.
Not yet. You want to go? <+++++> I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
Sure. <+++++> That was easy.
You look a little green. <+++++> Mm-hmmm...
Breathe deeply. <+++++> <u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>!
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate. <+++++> My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
Uhhh, gahdam stuff! <+++++> What did you say, Brother?
Bienstock. He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose. Wouldn't you know? <+++++> Want to switch berths with me?
Look, someone gave her the baby. <+++++> Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
Dad... <+++++> All I'm saying is they've got people who handle these things, David. They want HBO, they'll call you.
You be careful. I'm a powerful sorcerer. I could turn you into a toad just like that. <+++++> Miserable Pecks.
By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond? <+++++> Sightseeing.
_Two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _Second_ Bank of Gotham on the _22nd_ How could Harvey? _Two_-Face resist? <+++++> And you are?
Look, this is a bad time... <+++++> I've been going to debtor's anonymous. You want to see some truly fucked up people?
I can't do it, Ben. <+++++> You cannot escape your destiny.
He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five. <+++++> It seemed like my life was slipping away, somehow. I was a knot in the middle of a wet rope.
If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it. <+++++> I'll talk real slow.
Spent time in Arizona. Why? <+++++> Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces. <+++++> Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous... <+++++> I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
When? <+++++> When I get off work.
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker. I can promise you - <+++++> Joan, call a cop! We'll arrest this kid for larceny!
Better. <+++++> Arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'. They miss you pretty bad down at the garage.
Do we have the range of RenardÂs plane? <+++++> Anywhere in this circle. Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on. <+++++> Guess I'm not a single type guy.
You get what you pay for. <+++++> That's true. You grow up here?
Who are you? The undertaker? <+++++> Special Agent Pendergast. FBI.
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh? <+++++> Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
Oh, man -- <+++++> She hasn't called you?
The Doctors. <+++++> She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp? <+++++> N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
What are you doing? You're going to be late. <+++++> I'm calling in sick.
What do you think of this one? <+++++> I'd have to see it on.
Oh yes! -- UPSTART! <+++++> That's it...
You're the only human being I care for. <+++++> Then do me a favor. If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit. I want you to cure me.
And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer. <+++++> Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos. <+++++> I can't believe I agreed to do this.
Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear right now. So save yourself saying it. <+++++> I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened?
You know you don't have to do this. <+++++> I'm fine, I really am.
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant. A girl who had apparently become his secret love. <+++++> No one will believe your lies, whore.
CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT? ! <+++++> Yeah.
I've been a good worker -- <+++++> Don't do this, Don.
--Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse. It'll just get everybody in trouble. <+++++> I got lured.
Great! Find one for me. <+++++> With butter, if they got any....
What are you doin' -- <+++++> Lookin' around.
How did you meet Dr. Shea? <+++++> There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university. I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
Already? You poor thing. It won't last. <+++++> Why not?
I think so. <+++++> Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
It's just business. <+++++> I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
What about you? <+++++> I've got another one. Warmer. What will you do when it's all over?
Yes. Sorry. <+++++> Well....what do you want, then?
There are no other guests. We don't want to share this night with other people. This is for you and me. <+++++> I understand some rich guy bought up all the tickets for a perfor- mance at the Metropolitan and sat there listening to La Traviata, all by himself.
Roper... <+++++> Who's running it!
Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows. We're on in 3 weeks. Didya hear what I just said, Yo? <+++++> They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
A writer? What do you write... letters an' such? <+++++> B-b-books. You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
Come on, Ma. <+++++> Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break."
It happens to be a matter of life and death. <+++++> A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you. <+++++> That's not quite what I had in mind.
I'm fucking out of here. <+++++> Lawford?
Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison? <+++++> How could I? Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.
Is that how you think of yourself? <+++++> What, as a sales rep?
I live here. <+++++> You live here? ... We don't have any record of that.
Oh, I'm making investigations. <+++++> You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
Have you read it? <+++++> No, but I certainly shall.
Yeah... yeah! <+++++> All right! He didn't do it. All right? Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?
Get the trunk. <+++++> You have the keys.
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive. <+++++> That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right? Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews!
Nice and easy... <+++++> Six...
Twenty five? <+++++> Hell, make it fifty. Same goes for any business we have in the future.
No! I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that! <+++++> You missed the tag!
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office. <+++++> We must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married to "Brown Bess."
Well it's big. And it's blue ...  ... It's really really blue. <+++++> Mmmm. Boy. It's hot up here.
Don't be funny. <+++++> I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
In case of what? <+++++> In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
That's it. Just the two rooms. <+++++> This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago... <+++++> And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
What about rehearsal? <+++++> Gotta.
Shut up. <+++++> Made me feel all funny inside.
 <+++++> Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
Sir, I got Taipei grindin' on me here. How long is this supposed to ta--? <+++++> EXT. DAM - DAY.
Senator Paine will state it! <+++++> It was *I* who rose in this Chamber to accuse him. He is saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence--
Where have you been, Jay? <+++++> Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place. It's gettin' bad out there --  Where's West?
Oh. Fine. <+++++> Get anything?
...wanna give it a try! <+++++> Come on, old...
He tried to rob me -- he is dead -- <+++++> My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
 <+++++> Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
Mr. Eddy? <+++++> Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it. <+++++> Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.
What is it, Marquis? <+++++> My baby daughter has died... my baby... mon petite Henriette...
I'm glad you like it. <+++++> Paul, this will be our legacy.
I'd better order some food. That sounds like an interesting case. Wouldn't you like to take it? <+++++> I haven't the time. I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
Now I'm here. I'm in New York City. Getting picked for things. Don't you see what I'm driving at? <+++++> What you're driving at, you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy-ass party.
Undercover. <+++++> I thought so.
Any change? <+++++> I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
We won't let them. <+++++> No? How's an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them?
How's it feel? <+++++> Solid, daddy.
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP. <+++++> HEY!
And what was that? <+++++> Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
What do you mean? What happened! <+++++> We don't have time. I'll explain later, hurry!
 <+++++> But that's impossible!! George asked her out! He had to! I saw him walk her home! Oh, God!
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson. <+++++> And who IS Ted Nelson?
Now I can start to live. To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another. <+++++> Sounds very -- normal.
You can't talk to me like -- <+++++> Like a piece of shit? In my eyes, you are a piece of shit.
She's the thing you had to tell me. <+++++> Kind of.
What? <+++++> Look ten feet into the water.
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself. <+++++> Of course.
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.' <+++++> So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
I'd like to see that. <+++++> Nice.
Don't move. It won't hurt you. <+++++> How do you know?
So how come you could play basketball? <+++++> I just can.
Friend of yours? <+++++> Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
What's going on? <+++++> Lynch is giving him the boot... He's not pulling his quota.
You've never been to a dance, have you? <+++++> Only squares and nerds go to dances.
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues.... <+++++> That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
Okay. <+++++> Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So long.
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there? <+++++> At a guess... they just resurrected him.
Come back in an hour. <+++++> Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him. <+++++> Maybe he just travels in bad company.
And why not? <+++++> Because...
Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate. <+++++> We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
-- just to clarify -- <+++++> So boring, so useless --
So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh? Especially the new papers - <+++++> We certainly do. Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.
I got eight thousand yards. Radius is five... <+++++> ...miles.
Ha. Ha. <+++++> Look at the way we live. I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money? !
I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves. <+++++> But I see them.
You lilly-livered bleeding hearts! <+++++> I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place. <+++++> We need a car.
Preposterous. <+++++> I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous.
What is? <+++++> You stand on your tiptoes.
It don't bother me none. <+++++> Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right?
You could have a great beach house for that. <+++++> Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth.
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving. <+++++> The chauffeur. He's watching.
Yeah? <+++++> How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
Uh... at least fifty. <+++++> In your dreams! See you tonight!
When were you least happy? <+++++> Now.
Thank you, ensign. <+++++> No problem, lieutenant.
What are you doing here? <+++++> I forgot some of my stuff.
You know how she is. <+++++> You couldn't just hit her?
No, nothing. I've got a problem, I guess. <+++++> Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
. . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night? <+++++> Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
No way. <+++++> One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking.
You're a snake. <+++++> In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
We're gonna get married. <+++++> Yeah--that's right. Diz--
Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through. <+++++> The same thing that happened on our Pacific Coast. Anything from them yet?
No just Parry. <+++++> Oh...like Moses.
Twice. without her sensing anything? <+++++> Yes.
I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right? <+++++> Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
What? <+++++> Just stop it. Don't say another word like that.
But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d... <+++++> All true.
You go? Not watch fun? <+++++> I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
I have to pee. If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay? <+++++> You got it.
I might do it wrong. <+++++> Not possible.
Actually, I find it all fascinating. <+++++> And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives.
The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can. <+++++> Damn. All that reading paid off.
Why?! I think she's very attractive. <+++++> Adam! She's got bitch written all over her! You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
Yes? Who is there? <+++++> It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here. <+++++> No doctors? That's fine. That's just fine.
Mulholland Drive. <+++++> Mulholland Drive?
Someone tried to kill me. <+++++> The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.
Why me? Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from. <+++++> I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit. What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill. <+++++> Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
Why are there no photographs in these frames? <+++++> I took them out.
John? John where are you going? <+++++> I think this heat is making me crazy.
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time. <+++++> Then when? I have to talk to you.
You don't have to pee. <+++++> Yes I do have to pee!
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars -- <+++++> It's not a searchlight ÂÂ it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince Â- not stars --
Three. <+++++> Patel? Fuck you. Fuckin' Shiva handed him a million dollars, told him "sign the deal," he wouldn't sign.
Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner! <+++++> Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.
Do you want to talk? <+++++> No, I want to smoke.
Michael Meyers. <+++++> The serial killer?
Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze. <+++++> Some people will do anything for an autograph. Theo enters the diner and walks over to Buzz.
Elaine. <+++++> Te...!
What am I, five? <+++++> You're never too old for a lolly. I'm having one.
Every damn day. <+++++> No, I mean --
Where these tracks headed? <+++++> Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
Prison? <+++++> I was the Warden?
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me. <+++++> Oh, my God! She's right! Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik? She was-she was beautiful. She was willing.
There is power in this. And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all. <+++++> But we cannot be killed.
I'm trying to help, Duff. <+++++> Yeah!
What? <+++++> About forever.
So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi? <+++++> Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that. <+++++> Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
And that just because I needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother. <+++++> Your honor, I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla, California.
Sensitive -- what is that? <+++++> Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
You look like brothers. <+++++> Yes -- we do.
You expect me to just walk in there? <+++++> If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you.
What are you talking about? <+++++> The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
I brung this for when we had to kill them fellows. I guess we could use some now. <+++++> Not for me. I don't touch it no more.
How's the movie going? Your movie. You are making a movie, aren't you? <+++++> Yes. Fine.
Yes, I would. That's why I asked. <+++++> Well, I -
Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm. <+++++> Pimm's dead. Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared...
I miss my brother. <+++++> I miss him too.
Why there she is! Of course she's home. Stupid of me . . . <+++++> Hello.
A hot shot, huh? <+++++> Nah, just working the job.
Shut up, Kevin. <+++++> NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.
Are you? When? <+++++> In a day or so, I think.
You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man. <+++++> It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department. <+++++> What department?
Make them trust you. Hey Tyrone, you figure feeding our children is gonna make The Man jumpy? <+++++> Black people getting uppity, feeding their children breakfast, taking their destiny into their own hands. What's this world coming to?
I'm not sure. <+++++> Oh. Right.
 <+++++> That won't happen, Billy. Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.
Ahm.... <+++++> Bravo. Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we? Don't want anything to go wrong.
You need anything else? <+++++> I'll be okay.
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know? <+++++> Well, I don't know.
I know. I read it. These desecration's in the churchÂyou think they have anything to do with witchcraft? <+++++> Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh... <+++++> Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento.
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone. <+++++> You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
Sorry about that. <+++++> That's fine. There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
You're going too? <+++++> I lost everything I came after on this trip, but one T-rex in one theme park could single-handedly bail InGen out of Chapter 11.
I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz -- I read what he wrote -- <+++++> I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence.
Brazilian. <+++++> It would seem.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me? <+++++> No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy.
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends. <+++++> You don't find me cute? Come on, look at these muscles.
 <+++++> And where exactly does that put your position...?
You've reached a new low with this one. I can't believe you're crazy enough to use the room at the Marquis. <+++++> Why not? You think I can afford a suite like that on my salary? Is Jean-Claude done yet? *
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back. <+++++> I'll be there by seven. I promise
Boss, the way I see it is these kids probally stop off somewhere, bought a bunch of booze and are off getting shitfaced. <+++++> I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
I want to get in. <+++++> You do? Over here? On <u>my</u> side?
No. <+++++> Well, I'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair.
I'm not insulted. <+++++> You realize what is at stake?
So what's your story today? <+++++> They twisted my arm.
...have you come back? <+++++> Please, sir. We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West. We melted her.
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street. But then, I could be wrong... <+++++> Whoever. The point is, prices are goin' up, too. Better get your little black book out, Richard.
Sir? <+++++> You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed.
And do you like it that way? <+++++> Not really.
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care. <+++++> Man, you are one chilly square!
That's the original. There are no copies. <+++++> Exactly. That's why it's a make- able deal.
Andre Zhdanov? How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov? <+++++> Who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky.
WHAT?! That's insane!!! Why would I go to the police? <+++++> I've got to get that. Relax. I'll see you tomorrow.
What happened to her? <+++++> She was taken.
Me, too. <+++++> Why would you do that?
You can't know for sure, how can you? I mean, you're not him. <+++++> I was.
Walter have you been talking to yourself again? <+++++> Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker. Somebody's got to.
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these. Didn't expect we'd already met. <+++++> No big deal. We just got off on the wrong foot. What's your name?
You lied to me <+++++> About what?
... You look wonderful... <+++++> ... and my crown doesn't fit and... Really? ?
This is like a movie or something. I mean, am I paranoid or what? <+++++> It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
Down to Miami and back--how much damage can I do? <+++++> You're the fella who forgot he rented a Hertz car, do I have to tell you they didn't forget to send us the bill?
Did you manage to find good rooms? <+++++> They didn't seem too good.
I go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man. What d'you want from me. <+++++> I only asked.
You're in danger. All of you. I have no time to explain. <+++++> Wait a minute --
I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband. <+++++> Uh, you want us to do a guy? Huh huh. No way.
Score! Yeah! <+++++> Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us! <+++++> What are you talking about?
That's cool. <+++++> ...about this woman. I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
Not properly watered. <+++++> Whatever! You know how he gets. Well, he went absolutely bonkers.
Sorry, didn't know you were awake. I just thought Verdell shouldn't get too used to sleeping in here 'cause then... <+++++> Look, we both want the dog -- and...
I'm a witness to a murder. That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list. <+++++> Have you gone to the police?
You women are crazy! <+++++> You got that right.
Meaning? <+++++> I'm out.
Too slow? <+++++> Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell.
I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way... <+++++> You've already made arrangements! ?
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg... <+++++> Peg leg?
I... <+++++> Ahhh...
I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs. <+++++> He shoots dope too.
That's a lot of commitment. I admire that. <+++++> Do you really?
What doing? <+++++> I'm getting married tomorrow.
Keep it anyway. I have another one at home. <+++++> Thank you.
You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty! <+++++> I know. I've been here since eleven.
I think this is number three... <+++++> That's an opinion, not evidence...
He had nothing. He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he... <+++++> ...his family has offered a large reward.
A free thinker. <+++++> Everything's free there.
You're asking me a direct question? <+++++> Yes.
I'm not asking you to marry me. <+++++> No. What? No. I know.
If you ask us, no. If you ask the state alienists, the answer is yes. <+++++> It's a simple story. Earl Williams works for the E.J. McClosky Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years.
You name it. <+++++> Thousand dollars a game.
They've got lives to be grateful for. <+++++> William, you're not making sense.
Johnny Cammareri. <+++++> Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
Yes. <+++++> Then I'll go with you.
That's what she would say herself. <+++++> A wonderful woman, boy.
I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving. <+++++> Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.
You going to pull a Big Gulp with that? <+++++> No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
Not taken. <+++++> Why?
You know I don't live with him. <+++++> Go to him. Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp --
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something. <+++++> My Denise is a smart girl, she wouldn't do anything stupid, and her boyfriend, he always seemed like a good kid.
We have no Juliet! <+++++> No Juliet? !
Where will you be? <+++++> Anywhere but here. I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.
Yeah, uh, who's this? <+++++> It's me.
Good morning! <+++++> Could I trouble you for some water?
Neither does Joe. <+++++> His sister does. Big time. And the New York Times says addiction is genetic -- I'll e-mail you the article.
When is the deal going down? <+++++> I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.
Sounds like he wanted to get caught. <+++++> Maybe he did. He would brag to me all the time. He was never afraid of Caesar because he didn't know him.
It wasn't me, I mean the real me inside my body. I'm glad it's over. It's like a veil has been lifted. <+++++> Like a veil has been lifted?
Something like that. <+++++> Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother!
You are cold. <+++++> You're damn right I am.
You can't. You're afraid! <+++++> I'm going to. It's my second chance.
Ben, I'm a Man of God. <+++++> Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus! ! <+++++> Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
WellÂ <+++++> Well, what?
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it. <+++++> What's wrong with her.
Jack... <+++++> Don't worry, Mom. I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
20 bucks? <+++++> Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.
Dr. Gruber. <+++++> Dr. Gruber's not in.
An' you're dyin' alone, too. <+++++> I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
All of, they got you on this "board..." <+++++> I, I...I...
None shall pass. <+++++> What?
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley. <+++++> Never mind that. What's the story?
...It ruined me. This money. No annex. I'm all shot to hell. <+++++> So you paid the guy?
Up, get it? I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe in front of you. How long you been in the army? <+++++> I'm sorry, sir, I apologize. But if you weren't a captain, or if I were a major, what would you say?
Sure. <+++++> You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
Oh...nothing. Thirty pounds. I just haven't been very hungry. <+++++> How's your wife?
See you over there, Miles. <+++++> Yeah.
...leave me alone... please... <+++++> Answer the question and I will.
I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?... <+++++> I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
I'll look it up for you. <+++++> Well, look, is there a car here I can use?
Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice? <+++++> Oriental medicine.
You have to smoke so early in the morning? <+++++> It's good with coffee.
Don't get sore at me. I'm not an executive. I'm just a writer. <+++++> You are! Writing words, words!
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor. <+++++> I'm goin'.
Paranoid? The psychotic? <+++++> ...The Box can change their lives. Our stock coupons will spike.
I was here...as a kid. I think you were here, too. But you...looked just like you look now. <+++++> James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!
That's not the point. In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't. <+++++> Which is?
Yes. <+++++> Perhaps, later, when things are settled, when Jacqueline's well again -- maybe we can arrange things differently.
Someone should stand up and strike back. <+++++> What do you mean?
Cecelia is, well...you know <+++++> Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas... <+++++> Oh. I mean, except for that. Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
Oh that's good. <+++++> It was scary though.
You told them that? <+++++> It's true, isn't it?
Know who I am, Jake? <+++++> The Anti-Christ?
indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold. + <+++++> You got him wrong.
You guys got something going on downstairs? <+++++> We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.
They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency. <+++++> You promised, Tommy.
I...I don't know... <+++++> Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
I've been better -- <+++++> How long have we been driving?
Do you dream often? <+++++> Do you?
...yes. <+++++> Ohhhh --
What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that? <+++++> I don't know. End up in the electric chair?
I suggest you kids leave now. <+++++> Don't worry, I'm gone.
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man... <+++++> The penitent man. The penitent...
Sure thing. <+++++> We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight. Is this true?
Is it a good morning? <+++++> Yes indeed. You almost got yourself killed last night.
Why? <+++++> 10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.
You bring American money? <+++++> Never leave home without it. Lee, this one's on me. You save your money.
Right down to the kleenex I used. Sir, why? Is something wrong? <+++++> He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
Yes. <+++++> I can't understand. The sedatives....
Two bullets? Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick. <+++++> Come on.
The fight's set -- I don't need a manager. <+++++> Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.
...I do. <+++++> Could I please just go home? I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.
You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table -- <+++++> -- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils. <+++++> Wow.
Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system. <+++++> You don't have the authority to do that.
Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot? <+++++> No.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us. <+++++> With every breath we shall hunt them down.
I see, all right -- It's time for us to get out of this field. <+++++> I just got out here!
We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa. <+++++> Interesting analogy. And how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in Africa?
You'll work. <+++++> I ought to belt you one, J.P.
Don't you have any leads at all? <+++++> No Marty, I don't.
You think it's the end of the world -- but it's not, really. I went through exactly the same thing myself. <+++++> You did?
As always, Charles. P.S. Your dentist called yesterday. Your appointment has been changed." Not very much, is it? <+++++> We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
Oh hell. <+++++> Dad was never in England?
Such a bargain. But that is your decision? <+++++> I'm sorry. It is.
But you said she was a sparkplug...? <+++++> I said buttplug. She's heinous.
Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths. <+++++> She was playing with the Pooh doll.
Well I think you're right, I should look her up. <+++++> Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
Where did you get this power? <+++++> The power was within you.
I can't remember. I've got to make some money. <+++++> Thirty thousand dollars reward. In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
Pretty shallow of you. <+++++> That's me.
Have a nice trip. <+++++> Thanks. I will.
Want another cigarette? <+++++> Sure.
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt. Personally. Me. I did. <+++++> You are going back to school.
Yeah? <+++++> I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful.
I'll have the shortest run. If I don't make it, you don't go. <+++++> Colonel...we're all going. Whether you make it or not.
Grounded? Who's grounded? <+++++> Okay. You saw the fish man, right?
How come? <+++++> I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit.
You mean, the insurance frammis? <+++++> Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep. <+++++> And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
Get the broom. <+++++> I ain't getting shit.
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola. <+++++> That's fine.
Now we know someone's out there. Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner. <+++++> Fine. The information doesn't leave this room.
... What's that? <+++++> Christmastime.
Forty-five? I thought it was only supposed to be thirty? <+++++> Thirty is base price. Tolls, tax, tip ... it all adds up.
No, Daddy. <+++++> So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
You almost married recently, didn't you? <+++++> Last year. I -- it was broken off.
Easy now. <+++++> Easy? Easy? On just what grounds should I take it easy! ?
Oh, serious questions tonight. Of course I love you. <+++++> Like a sister?
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy. Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies. <+++++> In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon.
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then -- <+++++> I'm serious --
But not even before, when he was living upstairs? <+++++> No. I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love. Not yet.
A girl has to have a bit of glamour. <+++++> Absolutely. Long as she can keep it. Isn't that right, James...
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please. <+++++> Silly looking bunch.
Where is she? <+++++> I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
What went wrong? <+++++> Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
What are you talking about? <+++++> -- think what you have time to think, Lester.
Nice? <+++++> In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.
Please! Don't be foolish! Time is short. Let me show you something. Look at this syringe. <+++++> Why?
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson? <+++++> Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
Thanks. What are you doing? <+++++> Well, I sat down with my tapes and your photographs, which are great by the way... and I started writing.
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it? ! <+++++> I told you this was going to happen! I told you he was going to come after us! So we took the chance anyway and we lost.
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child? <+++++> Can I have this?
You can't sing at the competition. <+++++> I'm sorry, I totally spaced. I just...I didn't realize it...
Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults? <+++++> Toys for... adults?
Why don't you shut the fuck up? <+++++> What?
Tell me again. Your wife. <+++++> I told you.
Hi. Monica and Ryan? <+++++> Sally?
You wouldn't. <+++++> Would.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun? <+++++> Parts of it.
Lighten up. <+++++> But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house...
No, you can tell me. <+++++> Come on.
Huh? <+++++> You know, we're getting married.
He's not there. <+++++> He's here. Check the bathroom.
Honey, this is Thursday. I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti. <+++++> And many meatballs.
Because I never tried to suck my own dick? <+++++> No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself.
Did Karl go to bed? <+++++> I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess.
Who else knows? <+++++> Just you.
Dutiful citizens, you have something which I have waited years for. <+++++> INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY.
Forgive me, I've called you out and you should have been resting. <+++++> I'm fine.
Your dad's a doctor. Call him -- <+++++> He's a research doctor. You're dad's a doctor, too --
Tell the Chief we thank him. <+++++> Chief knows.
Anything this time? <+++++> I'm afraid not. Terribly sorry.
What happened? <+++++> I didn't know. I was in a panic. I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor.
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early. <+++++> How early?
I... I don't know. I don't know what you're askin' me. <+++++> Don't you fall apart on me. Goddamnit, Thelma.
Why? <+++++> Just do it!
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money. <+++++> I'll get some.
Why? <+++++> Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
Is that good or bad? <+++++> It's not good... unless I could find the Crystal. Then it could be very good.
Not at all. Why d'you ask? <+++++> It's not important good night.
How would you like the funds? <+++++> American currency.
Why the hell did he do that? What the hell did I do? <+++++> I guess he didn't appreciate your use of language. They don't speak that way on television. It's a rule.
Where'd he come from? <+++++> I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
...who...? <+++++> Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station. It was lovely meeting...
What you're doing to my neck... <+++++> Was I doing something to your neck?
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship. <+++++> I want to get money for you and the baby.
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it. <+++++> Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
...and have you ever met David Ferrie? <+++++> No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.
I didn't mean to... <+++++> No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened. It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life.
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that. <+++++> At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
Three fifteen. <+++++> A.M -- or P.M.?
But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun. <+++++> She's a broad! Got it! Just some broad!
Oh God. <+++++> Everything okay here? Neighbors said they heard a lady scream.
Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail! <+++++> What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking?
It's a place where religious people-- <+++++> Marlin Perkins and Jim!
Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all. I guess you've figured it all out? <+++++> How will they come at you?
I don't know. <+++++> He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
What is it Keaton? <+++++> Something - I don't know. I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
 <+++++> Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life.
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine. <+++++> Yours will do!
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place. <+++++> I know, but...
God damn you! ! <+++++> Yes.
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need... <+++++> Uh, I have a plane to catch to Cleveland...  Can I get my winnings?
Exactly. Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case. <+++++> Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our secret.
Where's the other half? <+++++> Probably the next meal.
Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh? <+++++> Hey --
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner. <+++++> Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
... fix themselves. <+++++> He's tampered with it, Dowser.
He's not coming. <+++++> Not coming? What happened?
You did good... <+++++> What?
The hoi polloi. Doesn't it mean the herd? <+++++> Precisely, Meeks. Greek for the herd.
Two, two-fifty. <+++++> I'll make it an even five hundred. Plus an extra hundred if you get me to LAX on time.
How do you mean? <+++++> What if their answer is, 'Oh, that's easy.
You need collateral. <+++++> Like this?
About raping me? <+++++> About NOT raping you...
You're kidding me. <+++++> No sir.
If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir. <+++++> Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son.
I don't know, either. I want to find out. I've never been hit, have you? <+++++> No. That's a good thing, isn't it?
I've seen lots of people. It's not a big thing for me. <+++++> Hand me a towel. I'm getting out.
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you? <+++++> I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
What we want to know about is Manchester. <+++++> Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we want to know.
What'd you fight, middleweight? <+++++> Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed. You go about what, bantam?
I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music. Has there been some screaming and yelling? <+++++> Yes.
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff. <+++++> Okay. Nazeer, okay?
Give me a break! <+++++> No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now!
I think you gave me the wrong one. <+++++> What do you mean?
Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or... <+++++> The accident...?
That was Gary Cooper, shithead... <+++++> No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twenty-five dollars. <+++++> Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
Are you in the service? <+++++> No sir. I'm a veteran.
 <+++++> Come on!
Dad! <+++++> It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
Good god. <+++++> Yeah.
Talk to me. <+++++> I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out.
You couldn't say. <+++++> I'm afraid not.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations. <+++++> We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
Oh. Who's in it? I know what it is. It's what's on instead of the movie. <+++++> I just want to see the basketball scores. It's important.
Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year. <+++++> So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?
...What? <+++++> How old?
What do you think about? <+++++> I don't know... I guess I think about the deer... Being out, maybe. I don't know. I think about it all.
Sure. I really like Annie. <+++++> Good, Jack. Maybe weÂll keep her.
I want two men stationed in that tier, and I want men with rifles all along the walkway. <+++++> Capt'n!
What're you doin', baby? <+++++> Goin' out.
Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue. <+++++> Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy. <+++++> I'm not cynical. Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.
Good-looking? <+++++> I just told you, she's half Asian. half American. They're all good looking.
Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday... <+++++> Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.
I've heard of it. <+++++> 
Time travel. I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer. <+++++> What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
What terrific story? <+++++> Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT! <+++++> Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
You're joking. <+++++> No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
 <+++++> Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went. <+++++> Did you love it?
Sounds risky to me. <+++++> You getting cold feet?
The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different? <+++++> Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
You're quite a housekeeper. <+++++> I told you, I ...
Please, continue. <+++++> We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic.
Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself. <+++++> You're an actor, so act, motherfucker.
Pop Leibel? Sure. <+++++> All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?
She's nobody. She likes me. <+++++> So I suppose a fuck is out of the question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No sudden moves. And not a whisper to her.
I have a question for you. I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words. <+++++> Just say it, Dad.
That angel of mercy, he ain't a she, is he? <+++++> You's better believe it, brother!
[Why?] <+++++> [I have a friend there.]
The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene -- <+++++> -- who's married to --
This game is over do you hear me? <+++++> I hear everything. And soon you will know everything. More than you ever wanted I can guarantee that.
Thirty-six hours. I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours. <+++++> I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
This has got to be one big violation... <+++++> This is quite a place.
...they start again three minutes earlier... <+++++> We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes. We were trying to restore her...
 <+++++> You don't believe in the Force?
...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from <u>that</u>... <+++++> The Ribbon Manufacturers.
I know. <+++++> How do you know?
Wait a minute, Daphne. You haven't got a bathing suit. <+++++> She doesn't need one. I don't have one either.
Shit, Pritchett!! ! <+++++> Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
No my brother, you have to go buy your own. <+++++> Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
Shari, I really like you... <+++++> I really like you too...
I never notice the view after the first week. <+++++> I would. Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap. Wonderful thing, money is. Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm... <+++++> So--
Did your father teach you humility? <+++++> He tried. It didn't take.
I hate all that fuss. But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away. <+++++> What would your mother say to that?
OhmyGod. Didn't she say anything? She must've said something. <+++++> Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
Tragically, they're dead. I'm alive and I'm in poverty. You want any? <+++++> No, thanks.
Maybe. <+++++> You're a big help. Can I have one of those?
Tell him I'm at lunch. <+++++> Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty.
Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination. <+++++> What's the matter with my brains?
All right -- I promise. <+++++> You are my old friend.
You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather... <+++++> Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper.
Not sure. How was yours? <+++++> I haven't decided yet. Rene, you wanna come over to the studio tomorrow. I wanna make a painting of you.
Yes. I would swear my love to you. <+++++> To me? But why?
You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on. <+++++> Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .
Yes, sir. <+++++> Delbert Grady.
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard. <+++++> It's our pleasure.
This might take some time. <+++++> I got nowhere to go. We haven't had a good sit-down for a long while.
I am a professional man. <+++++> Lips still for sale?
We're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some -- <+++++> Are you vice?
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why. <+++++> I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
Don't have to use it, O'Neil, but it's gotta go out. Five... four... three... <+++++> I can make this wall without --
Madame's doctor. She has moments of melancholy. There have been some suicide attempts. <+++++> Uh-huh?
As a matter of fact he does. <+++++> Hunh.
Now just get off the train. <+++++> HUH? !
Maybe a political operative of some sort-- <+++++> --a spy, you mean?
As I said before... <+++++> Sure. But I'd hate like the Dickens to be held to everything I've said before, wouldn't you?
Mrs. Haydn... <+++++> This is George Fox...
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic? <+++++> Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.
I told you. I'm like positive. <+++++> This thing works. We could go home right now.
Yeah, you can. You could just quit. People do it all the time. <+++++> I can't. Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me. I mean it.
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world. <+++++> 
It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band. <+++++> Hold on a minute.
There's coffee if you want... <+++++> <u>You</u> made coffee?... You're going back to work <u>and</u> you made coffee?...
I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone. <+++++> That's right.
So you admit it? <+++++> Guilty as charged. I'm not gonna play games with you. I could give you a song and dance but what's the point?
Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night. <+++++> All right then.
I got what I fucking deserved. I had it all. I could've kept going! <+++++> As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
... I needed that. <+++++> Tell me about it.
Rob. Rob Gordon. Circa junior high... <+++++> I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man. <+++++> The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
So I've noticed. <+++++> Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners!
Ate the gun. Oh. <+++++> Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem.
Well, then cut it in half. <+++++> I keep it for emergencies.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie. <+++++> I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
I don't care. Cancel it. <+++++> No way.
Is everything ok? <+++++> Yes.
Very good, busyboy. <+++++> Dwarf bowling's illegal.
But what if something happens to you? <+++++> Hear this now: I will come for you.
Mom and Dad? That's...crazy. They never said... <+++++> Oh sure. That's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  "Goodnight honey. Don't forget ot say your prayers.
Fuck the mall. You know that motel on the road west of town? <+++++> Yeah.
Breeders typically destroy albino pups, so this animal is truly unique. <+++++> Nicole Labetzki. Victim seven. Forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a K-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked.
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong? <+++++> Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.
Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!.... <+++++> You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough! <+++++> Yes, My Lord. We'll find them.
He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here. <+++++> Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own.
Oh God! I love you still, that's the torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis... <+++++> Yes...
Excuse me? <+++++> Come over around seven.
This and that. Y'know. Ways and means. <+++++> -- When he wants someone run down, you're willing to do it for him.
Whoa. Calm down. <+++++> Get out. Get out! Get out!
Ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin! May it ever be so adventurous! <+++++> I'm so frightened.
Yeah. Deep south. She laughs along with him, not sure why. <+++++> Why are you laughing?
Have you changed your aftershave? <+++++> Very funny. I had a box of Pampers under my arm for Chrissake!
Shoot, I appreciate that man. <+++++> If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
Why did you break into that particular building? <+++++> It was the biggest I could find.
He hasn't said one word to me. <+++++> Maybe he's just shy.
And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask? <+++++> No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered -- <+++++> When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
Would you care to be more specific? <+++++> What I have to say must be said to all concerned. It is too important to be entrusted to any individual.
He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it. <+++++> He wouldn't do that.
I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me. <+++++> I...
Get your clothes on, lady -- <+++++> GET OUT!
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer-- <+++++> Be my guest.
That your... "theory", ain't that what they call it? <+++++> Yeah.
I didn't think you'd know I went missing. <+++++> You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat? !
One-hundred-thousand!? That son-of- a-bitch lied to me. <+++++> Lied? What do you mean?
No. <+++++> What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
But she's such a nice lady. <+++++> But I don't want you coming here alone. You get me to go with you when you want to come here. You promise?
I said I wouldn't. <+++++> 
He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink. <+++++> Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state. <+++++> I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
Can we talk about something? <+++++> Not now. I have an idea.
But you think about Him -- It -- Her. <+++++> Don't you?
Too busy eating us? <+++++> Just go.
What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists? <+++++> We've got both.
What choice did I have -- ? ! <+++++> You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered? !
Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint. Mozarella is just fronting for you. <+++++> Mozarella? Never heard of him.
He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think? ! <+++++> I know...I know. You did the right thing.
What about? <+++++> Doreen.
We killed Old Shoe...  We killed the Schuster...spend our life in a packingcrate...Where are you <u>going</u>...? <+++++> Come on, Pal, come on Willie, come on, Old Shoe...
So I took his truck, yeah. <+++++> Yeah.
I'm not scared. <+++++> Prove it.
So you'll come out, right? <+++++> Yeah, okay.
I was doing my job. <+++++> Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me? <+++++> Forget it. I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob. I've got too much to do. <+++++> Sure. I'll see you on Friday.
Story of my life. Well, one thing you won't lose is that friend of yours back there, I'll tell you that. <+++++> Oh, no?
Oh, yeah? <+++++> So? What's L.A. like?
I want to hear it. <+++++> I've got a job.
Okay. <+++++> Yeah? Oh, great!
Look at that. You can't buy better protection than that. That there is your Man's Best Friend. <+++++> How are they with kids?
Were you in Cluett's apartment? <+++++> Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Is what you? <+++++> You're depressed that I come along.
Are you all right? <+++++> I've been better --
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days? <+++++> That's right.
Closed? <+++++> You'll see.
Did you need something? <+++++> Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
I'll wait for you till seven. <+++++> Okay.
Sure. He was trying to make us his family. <+++++> They're killing him!
Of course. <+++++> Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
Ed -- <+++++> No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D? <+++++> I feel certain my condition runs in the family. Can't this wait, dear?
The hell it is. <+++++> I'm telling you that's my car! And someone's gonna pay for it!
Good night. <+++++> You don't need a stretcher to take her with you. You know that, don't you?
It's pretty. <+++++> I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school.
I said that's the point! <+++++> Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master. <+++++> I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
I'm not made of glass. <+++++> I just want to sit here and be still.
No, I don't get you... <+++++> Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.
Huh? <+++++> Tell me you love me.
They came in and they, you know... <+++++> Well, they fucked it up.
If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden... <+++++> If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -
But we don't need it, I'm sure. <+++++> I see, we won't need that. Plenty of room, plenty of room.
And, why is that? <+++++> You're going to be remembered, and it's all because of me.
 <+++++> I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
Aren't you even curious? About why she did it? <+++++> No. I can't afford to be curious. And neither can you, Hunt..
Can I ask you a question? <+++++> Sure.
Are you perchance a registered voter? I'm also a mayoral prospect. <+++++> I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
Yes... <+++++> Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
No. <+++++> Wake up, man; I just got us a hot run for big bucks.
Okay, okay. Here, how about this? <+++++> Save it for your wife.
Before or after the explosion? Mueller -- <+++++> I don't know!
Is Crawford going with you? <+++++> No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil. <+++++> That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
Bainbridge Books. <+++++> Hi, Sara. This is Doctor Sheppard.
You guys are my parents. <+++++> Of course we are.
Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word. <+++++> While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out!
Your Majesty -- <+++++> Is it not enough that She is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors?! I am not a fool.
Think we're going to do it? Think we're going to war? <+++++> Not up to us. Up to the Iraqis. All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.
He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer. <+++++> Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun. <+++++> Fucking hope not.
Yeah, asshole. I'm puttin' a murder suspect and a guy who... <+++++> ...stole a truck under arrest.
What holds you back, Max? Tell me. Why does life scare you so much? <+++++> I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
Oh, yeh? <+++++> Hid it from my mom. Caught a mess a sea runs. Damn thing's still in my closet.
Good morning. <+++++> Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry. <+++++> Bullshit, you don't.
Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position.. <+++++> Which is neutral, no doubt.
For what purpose? <+++++> Yes -- Only there's a problem. The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision. <+++++> Oh, is that how it is ?
Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in? <+++++> Not yet. 'Love to bust my ass cause I'm not in frigging Mensa.
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly. <+++++> The workers don't get on?
You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. <+++++> So are you. You've got a vision.
...WHY DID HE COME BACK? WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...? <+++++> ...are you alright, sir...?
David! David! I can't believe this! <+++++> And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
Is that when you jerk off? <+++++> You can't talk to me like --
You bet! <+++++> So, did you buy a movie?
You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need! <+++++> What?
Had to be him. <+++++> She was very evasive.
Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice. If I hadn't defended myself- - <+++++> Just cool down, son. I ain't accusing you of anything. Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped.
But... it didn't just get there by itself. <+++++> True -- every event has an infinite number of causes -- but why pick one rather than another?
Yeah, but it was okay. <+++++> How did he look?
What do you mean, "good looking?" <+++++> Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot.
What a sorry old man, you're thinking. What a crazy old poof. Why are you here? What do you want from me? <+++++> You asked me to model. Remember?
I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge. <+++++> Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
J.D.? You seem pretty amused. I thought you were giving up on high school guys. <+++++> Never say never.
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there? <+++++> Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
It's just something I had. You know <+++++> Oh huh
Thinking about Thorwald? <+++++> And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me! Hate me! Help me! Hate me! <+++++> I forgive you.
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart. <+++++> Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
Are they going to work here too? <+++++> Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
You had breakfast yet, Margie? <+++++> Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
Did they send you...Did they send you? <+++++> Who is they, who is they?
M'hm. <+++++> I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up. <+++++> Get out.
She says she won't be intimidated by parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer. <+++++> What did she say about me?
Did you kill all those guards? <+++++> Yes ... I'm very sorry ...
Have to sleep. Have to sleep, Michael. <+++++> When?
I couldn't believe it-- he just left! It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him. <+++++> When Peter was little, he loved to hide. In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.
Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you. <+++++> Louis, you're a life saver.
Not on station time. <+++++> No. Not on station time. My story. My time.
I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself. <+++++> That <u>thing</u> happens to be my friend.
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage. <+++++> Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids.
Did you catch that thunder? <+++++> No way, death-breath, that was too intense for thunder. C'mon let's rock an' roll.
How far to the station? <+++++> Three or four miles...
For who? The fish? <+++++> For whoever's in that thing.
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades. <+++++> Raus! Raus! All of you!
Apparently. <+++++> Did he ask you to take your clothes off?
How do I know their voices are -- <+++++> Are real? How do you know you're not hearing things? How do you know I'm not someone in your head? Somewhere, you know.
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other. <+++++> Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would happen!
And I would like to see a priest. <+++++> Now?
Heat is heat. <+++++> Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan.
Jesus! What?! You want money? ! <+++++> Shut the fuck up.
What kind of scribbler are you Â newspaperman did you say? <+++++> No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now Â
Who? Who is he? What is he? <+++++> Your father. He was your father.
You're a basket case. <+++++> They knew it. Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew. It was right. It was real. It was...
And that I can drive a truck! <+++++> Better than I can!
You ass. <+++++> I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
You mean -- <+++++> You were right, Ellie. You were right all along.
What ? <+++++> Don't eat at the console.
...Who'd ya fight? <+++++> Spider Rice.
Good day, sir. I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well? <+++++> He's feeling wonderful.
Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case. <+++++> You admit that it is terribly dangerous. Why do you advise it?
And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement. <+++++> Stuart is fine.
Jack, are you okay? <+++++> 
No. But I've got a penknife. <+++++> HayÂin my teeth.
Yes, ma'am. <+++++> Good. I'm prepared to offer you a job.
Jesus! Are you serious? <+++++> Yes! I've dreamed of it for years, but your movie made me realize I've got to take action. GOODBYE, PENIS!
And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me. <+++++> You're right. It makes no sense.
This better not be a wild goose chase. <+++++> Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
Yeah, or "later, dickwad." Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out." Like that. Or you can do combinations. <+++++> Chill out, dickwad.
I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line. He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow. <+++++> I can't write anything by tomorrow.
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one. <+++++> And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name. <+++++> You must travel a lot, huh?
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours. <+++++> Oh, baby, you cruel...
Bridgework? <+++++> Very romantic.
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are -- <+++++> -- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself <u>into</u> --
That's ridiculous. <+++++> And your head is hot.
What's the word on the chairs? <+++++> I'm working on it.
I woke up the next morning and she was gone. <+++++> Did you change your will while you were with Miss Lawson?
Don't drop it Rose. <+++++> Rush her.
Well, it looks like it, Jasper. <+++++> Because of Kennedy? Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend. <+++++> Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
So you might be working for Uncle Sam. <+++++> I don't know.
If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me. <+++++> Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
What was she like? <+++++> Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't.
She was the only "Annie" you could find? <+++++> They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
What? <+++++> Don't go like that.
I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten. <+++++> You look upset.
That's a chimney swift, all right. <+++++> We know what it is, Al.
Is it still dripping? <+++++> It appears to have healed itself.
I can't do it, Louis. It isn't ethical. I could lose my license. <+++++> Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
A bride without a head! <+++++> A wolf without a foot!
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here? <+++++> It's the sequel.
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie? <+++++> I don't know what you're talkin' about.
I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee. <+++++> Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.
Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious. What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him? <+++++> Because he's not forty feet tall. The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
So what do you think? <+++++> Very realistic.
You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes. <+++++> Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
I'm not. We...we met at a party. <+++++> Sounds about right. Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's. Sure didn't get it from me.
Scream. <+++++> During sex.
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind? <+++++> I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
Oh God, oh God no. <+++++> Help me -- I'm going to try to get it off.
Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing... <+++++> What sort of thing?
After paperback it's basically someone else's problem. <+++++> It sounds exciting.
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright? <+++++> Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
 <+++++> Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
Sit still, look less like a meal. <+++++> I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
This is Indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you. <+++++> You need a ride, Preacher?
He did! <+++++> I wasn't in. My secretary took the message. He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.
Yeah, but it's real close. <+++++> Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
And you don't ask questions? <+++++> We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>? <+++++> Explain in depth the plan we have for him. Until tomorrow.
Well, think about it. Isn't it possible? <+++++> Yes. I suppose it's possible.
You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house. <+++++> Andy's house. Sid's house. What's the difference.
One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it? <+++++> Well, we didn't expect that much. I'm sure I can get her to settle quietly for one million.
Bye sweety, we could of been great together. <+++++> Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough? <+++++> I don't want your money. You're a booger.
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films. <+++++> You mean like going to the pictures?
And I've been doing just fine. <+++++> And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce.
Well, those guys share everything, right? <+++++> Right.
You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps. <+++++> What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
I don't know. <+++++> Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out? <+++++> He won't. He thinks I'm simple.
Remember the Alamo? <+++++> I beg your pardon?
Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview -- <+++++> I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid?
When do I raise the bet? <+++++> I don't know.
No, dummy. Two. <+++++> Your fingers are so small I can't see them. First word -- two syllables.
No, we're not! <+++++> We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles.
Well. <+++++> THEN WHAT?
I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you. <+++++> Buddy, before you join the jubilation at my being beaten again, you should remember: People vote not out of love, but fear.
No, Baron! I beg your pardon. <+++++> Thank you.
Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone. the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now. <+++++> No Jeffrey! !
Advanced botany. DNA splicing. Recombinant animal plant patterns. Pheromone extractions. <+++++> Pheromones?
Why not? <+++++> Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
Am I too heavy for you? <+++++> No.
Diver's camera. Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser. <+++++> Abandoned? It's a little early in the season for that.
Your father dropped off an extra check. <+++++> I don't want his money.
Are you asking me if I have something to prove? <+++++> Do you have something to prove?
Did you see me?! Wasn't I terrific? <+++++> As always.
Never! I'm going in and ask himÂ <+++++> If you do, I'll break your neck.
Thanks Meurice. <+++++> For what?
I need your help. <+++++> Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
You mustn't take it so badly. <+++++> Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
What? <+++++> There's a bucket. Under the table.
I'll try- but this feels so different- that old lion I killed could never carry off a man Singh's size. <+++++> But you said they were always old.
You're really gonna pop the question? <+++++> Got the ring. Got the airline tickets.
It's just a name. <+++++> Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door. <+++++> Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
I did not want them <u>dead</u>. <+++++> Did to.
They were wearing masks. <+++++> Of course they were. How many?
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face. <+++++> The last one you'll ever see.
Not half as bad as I feel. <+++++> Then why in hell're you doin' This? You ought to be in bed.
Not a holocaust -- <+++++> Mr. McFly here wants to nuke it all, just so he can see it!
Bitch! <+++++> Dirty pig!
I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab. <+++++> Well, you managed ta make it here jus' in time fer this case, didn't ya?
Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...? <+++++> I'm NOT like you! I'm NOT! You're cruel -
It. <+++++> It? Oh it. All right, these things happen, let me have a look. It's not the end of the world.
They really applauded you today honey. <+++++> I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me.
Relax, you need to chill the fuck out. <+++++> Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
You don't think I'm insane? <+++++> And that's your secret? You meant -- like a trade secret?
Most of the time I slap it. <+++++> You must be quite a girl.
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant? <+++++> I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.
Hey, and what if we  don't make it? ! <+++++> 
Yes. <+++++> What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man.
I don't like this, this... <+++++> Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
Smith, where the hell have you been? ! <+++++> We have a situation here...
Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform... <+++++> They're for my bodyguard. I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!
Rub it on the windows! <+++++> What-
You know I can't. <+++++> Then fuck it!! !
Order! <+++++> --to avoid bringing disgrace upon a clean and honorable State!
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure. <+++++> God, you... you're mean.
They've got Quaid! They're protecting him! <+++++> Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think. Do it.
Whatever. <+++++> I'm sorry.
I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is. <+++++> Where is she?
You're playing games. <+++++> Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward. <+++++> What?
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you? <+++++> No. It's all arranged.
We've got to rescue him. <+++++> If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.
No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps. <+++++> Joanna said that?
Uh, yeah? Lenny? It's me. <+++++> I just got off the phone with the cops. They called to check you brought the cab in...
Baked with a butter-lime glaze. <+++++> Now we're talking.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci? <+++++> Sixteen 'C', why?
Anita! <+++++> Look.
You find yourself wearing a... <+++++> ...badge someday, then you can ask the questions. Until then...
And you still believe he's going to come here? <+++++> Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I? <+++++> No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!
Then, who murdered the Old Crone? And why? <+++++> Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
May take a little time. That's not what Claire tells me about you. <+++++> Thinking Machine laptops, I'm talking about the 686 prototypes -- <u>with</u> the artificial intelligence Risk chip --
I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller-- <+++++> --She's not dead---
Up here, Docky Ocky! <+++++> No, no! Not there!
You got the wrong man. <+++++> I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man!
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it? <+++++> Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.

What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going? <+++++> Aw, she was with some nosey, smartass high-rise kids. They were poking around... asking stupid questions.
Um... They gave me a limo, uh... <+++++> Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.
No, I can't tell you! <+++++> What? !
This is all cause of your mom, Kyle. She's such a bitch-  AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie. <+++++> And she's getting worse...
Apparently. <+++++> I'm curious. The D-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?
Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is? <+++++> I'll kill you for that!
Aw, come on. It will be fun. <+++++> Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun.

Who the hell's Manolete? <+++++> The great Spanish bullfighter
Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there. <+++++> She'll be all right baby.

Yeah. Fuck it, Dil. <+++++> Fucking men, Col --
What's Liddy got? <+++++> Apparently he was using some campaign cash that was laundered for us through Mexico. The FBI's onto it. We could have a problem with that.
Yeah, so... ? <+++++> They celebrated the common person.
One-forty-eighth of a second. That's how long it's up there. <+++++> No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
Terrance and Phillip, you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT YOU! <+++++> Dude, what the hell is going on?
That. <+++++> That . . .
What am I injecting you with? <+++++> Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
Well, a little. <+++++> Reading dirty comic bocks. And you admitted it?
Oh, I never catch colds. <+++++> Really?
My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me. <+++++> You would have done the same for me.
Not as tough as you, huh? <+++++> No. And you have to be.
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her. <+++++> Oh, don't be stupid.
Well, how'll I get home? <+++++> Take the subway. We need the car. Hey, gimme the keys - the keys!
Yes, sir. <+++++> She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
Mmm. Same schedule's okay. <+++++> Alright!
...to him. <+++++> What?
Oh, yes! <+++++> Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
You're really pushing it, bringing me here. <+++++> I think it's exciting.
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with. you have no business taking it yourself. <+++++> I used to be like them, Neil. I know what they're going through.
Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein. <+++++> Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace? <+++++> No, not possible. Listen, I have to get out of here. I'm supposed to be getting information.
Yes... <+++++> Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
What's wrong? <+++++> We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide.
Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean? <+++++> It means nothing.
My mother's name, actually. Good question. You've done you're research. <+++++> And "Frank?"
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise. <+++++> Well, there you go. On for a video fest tonight? I've got some absolute classic.
Did the police contact you? <+++++> Very first motherfuckin' thing they did.
Um-hmm. <+++++> Except for one little thing.
Where did you learn how to do that? <+++++> I . . .
Naw. Uh-huh. <+++++> Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
Can't hurt. <+++++> How much do I owe you?
Barely. <+++++> You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you?
You coming, or are you waiting for Blackburn? <+++++> Blackburn's dead.
Yeah. <+++++> "yeah." the fuck do you know?
Where are the tapes, Graham? <+++++> What tapes?
So who...? <+++++> We don't know. Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that. <+++++> How can I? You lied to me -- the way Charles did -- and after promising you wouldn't.
Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning. <+++++> Who on earth would want to harass poor Dottie Hinkle?
Do you remember a Miss Simms? <+++++> I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable? <+++++> 
Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me. <+++++> No oxygen to the brain.
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours! <+++++> Sorry, Miss.
Whoa, slow down. How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet? <+++++> I don't know!
This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil. <+++++> He has Israel.
And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood. <+++++> That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
 <+++++> I said drown 'em all! Who is that?
Pig! <+++++> Bitch!
But who could've ... no, don't say it. <+++++> My lips are sealed.
Under love's heavy burden do I sink. <+++++> Too great oppression for a tender thing.
You're soft. <+++++> What'd you say?
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right? <+++++> Well, why not?
Look, Pop--let me read you a-- <+++++> Peter, I'm in no mood to hear childish prattle!
Tell Annette I'm busy in July. <+++++> C'mon, Walter.

Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows -- <+++++> Are you insane? !
What do they want me to do? <+++++> ...they won't let you go...
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke? I went to Florence once, too. <+++++> With the same friend?
Pencil it in for the next trip - <+++++> The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
Thirty -five years! <+++++> Then after that it's safe.
God, that's awful! <+++++> It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
Everything stays as it is! <+++++> A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
Must've read about the funeral. Sick mother. That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure. <+++++> It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south. <+++++> I don't know what you're talking about.
How'd you find me? What's happening? <+++++> They're looking for you!--
Reverse undercover? WE supply to them? <+++++> They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
Cain't beat 'em, join 'em. <+++++> Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four. <+++++> What? -- Who? -- Whom?
... Murderer... <+++++> Bruce, we're both murderers. Think how many people you've killed by letting me live.
Can I come over after Jamie's asleep? <+++++> My parents are going to come home early tonight.
Also, Melinda, please don't tell anybody at the store that Albert was here tonight, okay. <+++++> Why?
Good. That was good. Where do I go? <+++++> It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel. The address is 1921 North East 23. It's under your name.
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement. <+++++> They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
And what do you see? <+++++> Somethin's in my room.
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant. <+++++> Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure...
I couldn't help but notice you pain. <+++++> My pain?
In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out. <+++++> That what's happening to you, only faster?
You lost me, Dudley. I don't know what you're talking about. <+++++> You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine. We'll hold a clarification session soon.
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these. <+++++> I thought maybe it might be for Rachel Banks.
Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandÃ©mes services Ã quelquÂun rÃ©cemment... Vous Ãªtes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie... <+++++> Hello there. HowÂs the flat. I cleaned...
Who? Rob? <+++++> Yeah. You met him once.
You ready to keep winning? <+++++> Sure.
I don't know, Dad. But it was big. <+++++> I'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
No. <+++++> Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
Where's egghead? <+++++> His kid's sick.
What's that? <+++++> You never heard of that?
You let me believe you. You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it. God, how... how could you... <+++++> Alright, alright. Go ahead. When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
What're you talking about? <+++++> Haven't you been watching?
You're killin' me here. <+++++> Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
It's for you. <+++++> For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
For what purpose? <+++++> To...  To kill them.
Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted? <+++++> I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
I think I heard about that. <+++++> Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
What do you mean? <+++++> Well, this is a temperate zone.
FLorida? <+++++> I've never been to Florida.
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive. <+++++> You got weird kids, Frank.
It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that? <+++++> I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive.
Monescu! <+++++> Gaston Monescu.
I wish I could have seen that. <+++++> I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
help me get in the truck. <+++++> INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/CAB - DAWN.
Look, I can't cry with a faker present. <+++++> Candy-stripe a cancer ward. It's not my problem.
You know what they're doin' now, Lou. <+++++> This I know, Benny.
This must be very new. <+++++> Yeah.
Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here. <+++++> Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
We go back. <+++++> What? You gotta be joking.
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something. <+++++> Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.
Is this your place ? <+++++> Do you care ?
You... <+++++> Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list... <+++++> First girl I ever knew. Who lets me give her a bath.
Walking where? <+++++> California.
I think he's running for town crier next year. <+++++> I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage.
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks? <+++++> That's right!
You don't want to know. <+++++> Oh, I do want to know. I tried to reach you at the precinct.
She said, "Will it change my wife." You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy. <+++++> 
And don't forget. I have the key. <+++++> You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things.
Why can't you leave me out of it? <+++++> Helen -- the killer directly contacted you. His interest in you is <u>intense</u>. I'm worried about you.
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man? <+++++> No. Have you?
The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals. It's actually not that an unusual set-up. The secret passageway on the other hand.... <+++++> The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.
You like her? <+++++> Yeah. Yeah we get along well. You didn't get along with her very well?
In the car. <+++++> I see what you mean.
Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want. What is it you want? <+++++> The same thing you do.
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk. <+++++> Junk?
Another, Frank . . . ? <+++++> ...everybody.
Bobby! <+++++> Not a very good one, but--
Can you walk? Are your legs working...? <+++++> <u>Perhaps</u>... shall we <u>see</u>...?
That's it? <+++++> That's it. Just do it, all right?
...I made a reservation at... <+++++> ...apartment. No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe. <+++++> There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
You want to come along quiet? <+++++> How's Atley -- ?
Ha ha. No, really. <+++++> It was a long time ago.-
From whom? <+++++> From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
What are you doing? <+++++> Cutting it out.
Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son. <+++++> You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
No way butt-hole! I want the window. <+++++> Cut it out butt-hole!
Whatever. Sorry. <+++++> No, not whatever. You fucking derelict.
Outrun them. <+++++> This is a Fiesta!
Were they pretty? <+++++> Yes.
Do they have cable? <+++++> No.
Well, it's quite a place, your "ashram" -- is that right? <+++++> That's right. The word only means "community." But it could stand for "village"... or the world.
Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office. <+++++> Thanks Meurice.
Now don't tell me you were drunk at the time and don't remember! Or is this one of Bingy's snow-storms? <+++++> No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
Yeah. <+++++> I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine.
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger. <+++++> Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it woman?! Now just calm down here.
I want nothing to do with the arena. <+++++> Something else, then. Do the chariot races interest you?
Hey, Lady? Lady! Can you talk? Who are you? This is not working. Think of something else. <+++++> Okay. Okay. I got it. I know what to do. Stay close. I have a plan.
What's going on? <+++++> Get in the car. <u>Now</u>.
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove. <+++++> You're late.
This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose. <+++++> Uh huh.
A daisy for the lady. <+++++> The lady knows this is a dandelion.
Poker's not your game. <+++++> What is?
We were like sisters. Knew everything about each other. <+++++> Must be tough for you. What happened.
Why? <+++++> I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill. <+++++> We will practice in the mornings, my boy, and I'll put you up to a thing or two worth knowing.
And you believed that story. <+++++> He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that. <+++++> What do you do?
Ni-notchka. <+++++> That is correct.
Damone, are you there? <+++++> I'm really pretty busy...
I like it. Can I be your friend? <+++++> Stay away from my thang. Sorry, honey. 'Thing.'
I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide? <+++++> Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
He'll barely be able to sit up. <+++++> That's the idea. Here we are.
A car sounds sensible. <+++++> And I need Fridays off, to spend more time with my family. Speaking of which - if you'll excuse me ....
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised - <+++++> You asked for death. I didn't promise it -
--jeeeeeeesus-- <+++++> --fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--
Which is? <+++++> That it wasn't an accident.
All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that? <+++++> Well, is it my fault if nothing happens?
Anyway, it was too much of a loss for my mother... she had nothing left. <+++++> Except you.
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family. I mean, he's, you know, he's-- <+++++> You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
Let's see it. <+++++> Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.
I forget what they said but it's pretty funny. <+++++> Why have you come to my planet?
What is it? A sapphire? <+++++> A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean.
 <+++++> This a con?
Do you live in a house back in wherever. <+++++> Grand Rapids? Of course.
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She -- <+++++> Dorothy, please! We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them. <+++++> She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people? <+++++> Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do I look like Mother Theresa? If I did, I probably wouldn't mind talking to the Geek Squad.
Hell, good luck! <+++++> Good luck to you too, Paul.
They'll be there waiting. <+++++> Who will?
No relation. Never heard of him. Sorry. <+++++> Say Steve, where's your manners? Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?
Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. FiftyÂfifty. <+++++> SixtyÂforty.
Yes! <+++++> I love you! I love you!
Why do you say that? <+++++> I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
Got it. <+++++> And ze rope?
The Drugstore? <+++++> Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
Will they free me? <+++++> I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.
What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up? <+++++> Oh. I forgot.
Poor Mac. It's been a bit of a struggle. I'm sure Sally's told you. <+++++> No, what?
Nobody's going to believe it. <+++++> Believe what?
Some classy tub in it's day, huh? <+++++> Yeah.
And who's Dave when he's at home? <+++++> He's at home.
But I have in India- every country presents problems. <+++++> You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
It's over, I'm telling you... <+++++> You need a new passion, Louis, a new reason to feel... what a story you've told, you don't understand yourself.
We've got rope? <+++++> For climbing.
Do it to ourselves? <+++++> We have to stick with the plan.
Certainly not. <+++++> I insist. There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded.
Are we what, Jack? <+++++> Is there something going on between us?
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS! <+++++> And with that complete loser
Is your stateroom alright? <+++++> Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you? Is my nose bleeding? <+++++> Well, of course not. My goodness, what a fuss you're making.
Look. <+++++> Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive.
Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent. <+++++> What did he say, exactly?
That smells like fresh coffee. <+++++> Let me get you a cup?
It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot. <+++++> What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
Well that's just typical isn't it? <+++++> Is it true Phil?
Why they glow like that? <+++++> Legend says that when the stones are brought together the diamonds inside of them will glow.
Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink. <+++++> That's all right, really, thank you.
What? <+++++> Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
 <+++++> Yes.
Why didn't you send the money over? <+++++> Somehow I didn't think you'd wait for me if I'd sent it first.
I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and talked. <+++++> German. Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.
You working? <+++++> Yeah. On the section gang.
Are you attracted to me? <+++++> Yes.
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard. <+++++> I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
Casualties? <+++++> Fourty-four, twenty one dead.
Aren't you Nick Charles? <+++++> Yes.
What are you doing? <+++++> It's freezing out here.
Hello Lloyd. <+++++> Hello. Heard about that graduation present. Really quite a car.
I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child. <+++++> Do machines ever play?
That sounds fine. <+++++> Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five hundred and sixty-five. Five six five. It's up to you.
Just myself. <+++++> That's right, you've had to supervise yourself. This place needs a sales manager.
Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over! <+++++> It's the way Pop wanted it.
Black... <+++++> Leopard Skin...
They'll be all right. I'm surprised they lasted here this long. <+++++> I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
The number was 235 - I bet it combination. <+++++> It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
We've got to disarm the bomb. <+++++> Doolittle, are you there?
You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing. <+++++> I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise. The rest meant nothing to me.
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep. <+++++> I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
I thought the subject was sex? <+++++> As it pertains to you -- not me. Did you always know you had different... tastes?
It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room. <+++++> Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
...Well, you know, not counting the first table. <+++++> Thanks for clarifying that.
What are <u>you</u> doing here? <+++++> I'm worried about you.
-- where's left to go? -- <+++++> -- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars." Who said that? <+++++> I don't know.
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know. <+++++> I won't be at the office except to sign in. I've got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place.
Bianca Stratford. Sophomore. Don't even think about it <+++++> Why not?
Livid is good. So what is it, Maggie? You here on business? I saw your lamps. They're terrific. <+++++> It's something I've always wanted to do.
Chulo, one thing at a time. <+++++> Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it.
No. <+++++> Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.
What a nose. You missed your calling. <+++++> Can I open it?
Running someone else's brain. <+++++> Up on the right.
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it. So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me. <+++++> You wimp. I had a lot riding on this. They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
I don't give a fuck about your parents -- <+++++> We sometimes went downtown to score.
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light. <+++++> Light?
Did you look? It was on the top shelf. <+++++> No, it wasn't. I swear none of this was here. None of it. You think he hid it? Earlier.
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate. <+++++> Fire the rockets!
Someone who loves you. <+++++> Leia!
Where are you? <+++++> I'm here.
You sealed off the system. When it crashes, everyone dies with you. <+++++> Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
What? <+++++> The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much. <+++++> What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
This guy -- where did you meet him for the first time? Where did he come from? Who is he? <+++++> Did he have a wife? Did he had a girl friend? Did you know them?
Don't you want dinner first? <+++++> No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train. <+++++> Now Penny, stop that!
... You knew you had a double? <+++++> He is my brother.
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen? <+++++> Jamie?
Since this morning. <+++++> What happened to your hand?
M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles. <+++++> Um-hum ...
Yes. <+++++> I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
Hey, sport. You winning? <+++++> Yeah.
Nice work. <+++++> Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there. You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
You don't go after the local scrunch? <+++++> I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse.
The lobby's half filled now. <+++++> What are you talking about?
As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew. <+++++> Just what is your question?
My name is Camille -- Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name? <+++++> David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder. That feels better.
Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by that tree. <+++++> Tree.
If Luca sold out we're in real trouble. <+++++> Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
Alright, how do you guys stand? Well, Finch, I know where you are, but you can't use that as an excuse. Jim? <+++++> My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
This is not about money, Emil. I need your trust in me. <+++++> What else do you need?
You mean, no prints but hers? <+++++> No Frank. No prints.
Marcus -- I've seen this window before. <+++++> Where?
 <+++++> God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
Leave me alone, Conor. Please. <+++++> You're not talking sense, Mara!
A great deal. <+++++> I've traveled so far -- and thought so much.
Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see. <+++++> Hey, Mr. Arky, gimme a break! I'm seventeen years old! I'm not responsible for all these problems!
Where were you? Don't tell me. It's just under seventy, right? The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh... <+++++> Would you please get your hands off my face, Tallulah? What happened to the newspaper?
Hello. You all right? <+++++> I'm sorry I woke you up.
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill. <+++++> Tough... ...I get off duty at five-thirty. How long you been divorced?
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that? <+++++> He did. Captain Renault did.
So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us... <+++++> ...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
Get out! <+++++> The engine is still running.
You want to hit? Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot. <+++++> Him?
It's the FBI. He wants to come in. <+++++> Have him walk in backwards.
She is beautiful. <+++++> You've changed your mind.
I want the girl. Unharmed. Now. <+++++> I know. That is why I will prevail. Mr. Grange... ?
You in business with those guys or what? I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern. <+++++> You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all. I cornered the whole goddamn market.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl. <+++++> Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
I just wanted to say Âhi.Â  Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work? <+++++> Yeah.
Cab One, do you see it yet? <+++++> The magnetometer is pegged. Side-scan is showing a big return, but I don't see anything yet.
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all? <+++++> Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
Your timing is impeccable, Commander. <+++++> The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
Head nigger in charge? <+++++> I'm the man.
Have you ever had anal intercourse? <+++++> Yes.
You must have a lot of confidence in me. <+++++> I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
Tribuus... tomorrow. <+++++> You're coming back?
Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit. <+++++> Excuse me?
About not finding any bogey men? <+++++> I'll get over it.
Who makes all these? <+++++> I do. And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
President? Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up. <+++++> Really. What'll I pin this on?
Mother of God ...have mercy ... <+++++> Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
Amber... <+++++> No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
A building? <+++++> A building isn't as light as air. What's large, but as light as air and can't be moved?
This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon. <+++++> So it did.
You disappoint me, Emma. Can't you guess? For you. It was all for you ... <+++++> 'Our revels now are ended.'
Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither! <+++++> Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this.
She's awake. <+++++> We'll be quiet. Quick and quiet.
Let's not make it worse. If anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time. <+++++> I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain.
Second district, Casbah, West Algiers. <+++++> What "group"?
Especially not Miss Kubelik. <+++++> How's that again?
I'm a liberal! <+++++> No...
And to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight... <+++++> You won't of missed much.
General Lee is detained captain... <+++++> Detained by what?
What's on your mind, Lieutenant? <+++++> The <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>, sir.
I wanna go...Just let me go... <+++++> Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
No. <+++++> Sorry, Ned. Guess I wasted your time. See ya, Kid!
Nuts. We got a big meeting in Vegas coming up. And we're kinda just gettin ready for that right now. <+++++> Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach.
The fuck is wrong with you? <+++++> I gotta go to the bathroom.
Yeah? <+++++> Mm-hm. I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself.
What're your taking down? <+++++> Standard vig. Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring? <+++++> Well, wait and see.
I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going. <+++++> What the hell is this?
All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you? <+++++> Do they have drinks?
I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again,  I'll f-, I'll f- <+++++> She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
Does it have a television? <+++++> No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.
What the - ? How did you - ? <+++++> Emergency procedures.
It's good to see you, Ellie. <+++++> You too.
We're on the move. <+++++> C'mon, Champ! Happy Halloween!!! You're taking me for a walk!
Are you all right? <+++++> She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story.
You never eat when you're despondent. <+++++> I switched that around when you weren't looking.
A girl. <+++++> I don't have a problem with it.
You aren't planning to tell these kids that 'virgin' was tattooed into both Stacy and Rod, are you? <+++++> No.
Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke. <+++++> Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK? <+++++> Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
One. <+++++> What?
I think I dropped an earring. <+++++> Looks like you have them both on.
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian. <+++++> You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them.
I heard how you talked to him. <+++++> Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?
He went back for his brother. <+++++> We said 48 hours.
Look pretty rough. <+++++> Just like any other hard cases. Gotta know how to handle 'em.
Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes. <+++++> I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
God, you're really obsessed... <+++++> I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
Yeah? <+++++> Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today? <+++++> I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry. <+++++> You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
Your blood, Max. <+++++> My blood? I ... I gave at the office.
Just...images, really. Feelings. <+++++> Tell me.
I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph. <+++++> Why not?
So were my parents. <+++++> Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little.
Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too. So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk... <+++++> That's where the popcorn business comes in. You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger. <+++++> Hey, Mick!
I don't know if I want to be doing this. <+++++> Doing what?
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips? <+++++> Enough!
Whose death? <+++++> It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
Finish what? <+++++> ... I think the whole process would have taken an hour... maybe more. And then I suppose both would have changed back to dog form.
I want you to hear this. <+++++> I really think that <u>business</u>...matters should be discussed between you t...
Boy oh boy, you're a mess. <+++++> Yeah.
Everything happens for a reason. That's what my dad said. <+++++> Then you tell me, what just happened?
You really think that's what happened? <+++++> I don't know but it makes one hell of an opening statement.
YouÂre moving... <+++++> Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and IÂm going to be heading it up.
Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about. <+++++> Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars. <+++++> Uh huh, well...good to know. Phil hands Nick a               5 note
You look good... <+++++> You, too, Ma...
Better now. Where 'you at? <+++++> Right here.
So what are you thinking? <+++++> We're out of a job.
I am? I mean why? <+++++> Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
Don't do this. <+++++> I'll lock him away for good.
I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you. <+++++> That's right.
I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more --  Serious! <+++++> Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar!
What's going on? <+++++> We're under attack.
I thought I told you to get lost. <+++++> Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
Didn't hear it. <+++++> There is something missing here.
What upsets you about that? <+++++> I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage.
Chase. Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up? <+++++> Forget those two clowns, Heather. Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh-- <+++++> No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections.
Oh, is this Adele? <+++++> Yes, it is.
--it was bullshit the way it was-- <+++++> --I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on. <+++++> ...finish out the game, Bud, push yourself...
No thanks, Diz. <+++++> What's your malfunction, Rico ?
I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that. <+++++> It all depends on what you're used to.
I'M LOOKING FOR LOVE <+++++> I'M LOOKING FOR TRADE
Yes am. <+++++> Pretty close?
We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral. <+++++> Most prudent. Engine room. Report, Scotty.
That's what you look like. <+++++> You know what you look like?
Yes? <+++++> ... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
I wouldn't mind a havin' supper. <+++++> Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot.
Manolete? ! <+++++> Who the hell's Manolete?
I don't know. Sometime. Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me? <+++++> What?
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven. <+++++> I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?
I apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like the Earth's caught in a crossfire. <+++++> You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo.
The front door slammed. Someone went out. There's a different car starting. <+++++> I might still get there first. The lights are with me. How would I identify the guy who shows up at the bank?
My ass is falling. It is. <+++++> What are you talking about?
Please don't say this. <+++++> Mank-
This isn't going to work. <+++++> Why didn't you say so before.
I want to sleep here tonight. <+++++> I think it's be better if I was alone.
What if he won't stop? <+++++> I mean, it could get us both killed.
An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on. <+++++> I never *seen* her so sassy. An' she ain't so young, neither!
I know you're busy so I'll get right to it. Did you know her? <+++++> Only in passing. To say hello to.
Would you excuse us? <+++++> Tom.
Sure, Reiben. <+++++> Where are you planning on putting Private Ryan, sir?
Why was <u>she</u> exempted, Nick? <+++++> Maybe whatever they are, they just haven't appeared yet on her?
I don't know sometimes. <+++++> You're just scared.
What, sir? <+++++> Is it the good room?
Donny -- <+++++> Donny-nothin'!
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid. <+++++> Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?
Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a "V" shape?-- <+++++> Yes I do...
I heard that! <+++++> I'll be at the Observatory Sunday.
Lying bastard. Lied to my face. <+++++> We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
We would have enough to keep us going for at least five years, even with inflation. <+++++> Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP.
Been so long plain forgot how Good it feels. Want to thank you For that, Wyatt. All your doin'. <+++++> We're gonna do it, boys. Gonna Get ours. Feel it in my bones.
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong? <+++++> What don't you do? Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
Working under adverse conditions. Highly adverse conditions. <+++++> Sounds smashing. I'm in. Muchacho, mi carro, por favor! Now be serious. You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
Oh, our relatives... the children. <+++++> The children! May I see?
Uhhhh... <+++++> What?
Like what? <+++++> Oh, you know what. I'm suffocating!
What's it look like, Nick? <+++++> I don't see any violence, Jim. Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm. Looks like natural causes.
Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you. Understand? Understand? <+++++> Yes...
What do you want? ! <+++++> Shari, I'm just really sorry.
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated. <+++++> For the purpose of what?
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear. <+++++> Yah.
What'd he say? <+++++> He said -- "Which we already knew!"
Usually I just turn the can upside down. <+++++> Maybe we should soap your hand or something.
Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again. <+++++> What would you tell the kids? At your new school? You had to come up with a good story, right?
Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why. <+++++> Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different.
At least they weren't lit. <+++++> I hate this fucking place.
Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive... <+++++> I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed? <+++++> Sounds like kind of a good idea.
Emmett! Am I glad to see you! <+++++> Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
Honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning. <+++++> Just think about it.
What's that? <+++++> A Prairie Oyster, sir. [10]
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me. <+++++> Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know.
We've procrastinated. We've pretended. We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too. <+++++> Pontificated.
Why do you always use your left hand? <+++++> Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
You think I wanted to come here tonight? You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it. <+++++> Tell me. Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
...Fine. <+++++> Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
Have I lost you, Steve? Have I...? <+++++> Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up -- <+++++> We're getting ahead of ourselves. We haven't gotten any sleep. Let's just keep our mouthes shut and not make any mistakes.
Stop by later. <+++++> Okay, bye, I will.
I don't like you! I never have! I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it? <+++++> You've made that quite evidentÂwith all your threats of annulment. Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute.
That's from skiing. <+++++> Skiing?
 <+++++> Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues. <+++++> First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
She's got no fucking pulse. <+++++> You don't know what you're doing.
I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic. <+++++> So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely! <+++++> All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!
What? <+++++> Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay. <+++++> No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
Black suits you. <+++++> Sorry?
So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen? <+++++> I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
Oh migod! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. It was an accident. <+++++> What are you doing up here?
Nothing that I can't handle though, Lloyd. Thanks. <+++++> Women! Can't live with 'em. Can't live without 'em!
I don't drive cross country. <+++++> But if you did.
Pauline's mum got killed. <+++++> No, she didn't.
We had Davy Crockett hats... They made a fortune. <+++++> 
On your own time? <+++++> Happy to do it.
Who? <+++++> Give me that shit. Your wife.
She's left before... <+++++> She's left the room before. She always came back.
Just one word of advice for next season. <+++++> What's that?
I gotta go. <+++++> Will you hang on just a second.
So what? <+++++> So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide.
Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James? <+++++> This is April, right?
What happened? <+++++> His father worked in a strip mine north of here. Toby's school class went up to the mine one day.
He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him! <+++++> No, Starla! No!
But...Why? <+++++> It's difficult to... On our planet we pretend in order to... entertain.
We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor. <+++++> You know something? You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity. What do you imagine people thought?
Am I that Prince? Hana laughs. <+++++> Because you're leaning? No, you're just on an angle. You're too heavy!
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me... <+++++> Excuse me, sir?
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it. <+++++> No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed? <+++++> He sounded fine.
No -- you're right. <+++++> I'll talk to you in the morning.
Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two? <+++++> It was God's will.
Whoa. No shit. <+++++> It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already. <+++++> Why, somebody's complaining?
I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone. <+++++> About raping me?
Can you swim? <+++++> Yes mam...
You certainly have a nice place here. <+++++> Well stocked.
What's Burke got to do with it? <+++++> Well, when I went to get the Thorazine I had him to stay with her and... Oh, I should of known better.
I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario. <+++++> Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.
You'll be able to find your way back, won't you? <+++++> Oh, yes.
Couldn't help but overhearing. Two fine young people starting out on the road of life. I wish you the very best. <+++++> Thank you...
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay? <+++++> Do I have a choice?
I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did. <+++++> I don't want you to be hurt.
Thanks, miss. <+++++> You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
If you're beached, why are we doing this? For practice? <+++++> Yeah.
Why would we go to Odessa? <+++++> Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now. <+++++> I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
Oh... <+++++> ...shit.
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping? <+++++> Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching? <+++++> Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
Issues ??? This guy has the damn subscription to every psychotic issue I've ever heard of. <+++++> That's cute asshole.
Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves -- <+++++> What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
Well, I'm not. <+++++> That's very interesting.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you. <+++++> She just needs a new windshield wiper.
He is. <+++++> And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place.
I'll say anything you want. We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is. <+++++> Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here. <+++++> You read my mind.
Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted. <+++++> Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.
Who's Joey Venza? <+++++> Bad fuckin' news. Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer. <+++++> My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses. I can't stand it. But you're different.
I've seen him. <+++++> Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you.
I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m. <+++++> You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
Huh? <+++++> I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.
Would you know the room? <+++++> No... it's in shadow.
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex? <+++++> Cool it, Andy.
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz? <+++++> Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us.
Some people don't think it's healthy. <+++++> Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
O.K. Thank you very much. <+++++> Happy hunting.
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it. <+++++> But they will know about it, Burke. From me.
I found them in your file box. <+++++> Must be a spare set.
All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time. <+++++> I beg your pardon. Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
What? <+++++> Will you marry me?
I don't have time. <+++++> I'm only asking what you think.
But where's the damage? <+++++> Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
She took you shopping for a tie? <+++++> I had to follow her to a store.
While he was here. You went about together? <+++++> He was here for four days.
They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash. Aren't the hugely wealthy sad? <+++++> You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
Okay, not bartending. Why on the water every day? <+++++> Because.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went. <+++++> I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Are you trying to seduce me? <+++++> No. Why? Are you seducible?
She smiled baby. <+++++> That's not cool.
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years? <+++++> No, but...
Substance abuse? <+++++> Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
 <+++++> Contributions! It was a legal contribution. Who the hell authorized this? Colson?
About fifty grand. I won it at the tables. <+++++> No, Carter. I can't take this.
Pete, I want to talk to you! <+++++> I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
Bad manners. <+++++> Yes. That's right.
You want me to help? <+++++> You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...
Let me carry one of the instruments. <+++++> Thank you. Aren't you a sweetheart?
It was at least as good as the sky. <+++++> Really? Okay!
I'm trying to quit. <+++++> I've got news for you. It's not working.
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries--- <+++++> Susanville, Soledade.
You can't take a cow by eminent domain. <+++++> We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
`Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.' <+++++> You're kidding.
I don't know. <+++++> Proceed inside.
...What? <+++++> I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'.
What is it? Has he fainted? <+++++> It looks like it. Smell those fumes?
When was that? <+++++> I was eight.
Hiya. That's a lot of money to be counting out in public. <+++++> Yeah.
 <+++++> Easy enough.
Stewart! <+++++> This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it.
How is he? Still fighting crime? <+++++> Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring. Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
What to the rebels want? <+++++> Oh, the usual. More money, more freedom, more air.
I don't think so Mayolia. <+++++> I want to be part of it, I want to inspire you, I want to do - something!
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by. <+++++> Well, he didn't have it last night.
I'm not playing a game now. <+++++> Yes you are. You're playing word games.
I've been working on this poem for 12 years. <+++++> Really.
Hi. Didn't get a chance to say goodbye. <+++++> That's my fault. I get too worked up at these. I'm very method. You do know... that's not my name.
Who? <+++++> A wiseguy. Paying 100 Grand for the rapists if I turn then over direct to him.
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled -- <+++++> My twin. Which has kept him alive. Until now.
Hey, Ros, where are they? <+++++> In the conference --
Mind your own business, Father. <+++++> This is my business.
How long 'til they reach us? <+++++> Eighteen minutes...
Did you believe in them too? <+++++> No. I did not. I have never told anyone this, Neo.
I have something to tell you. <+++++> Lay it on me.
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired... <+++++> Yeah, and for yours. I'm sure you've changed.
All right. <+++++> Thank you. Goodbye, John.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet ÂÂ	one as a detective. <+++++> It sounds strange, and I'm going to be very wary.
Your shorts are looking especially gold today. <+++++> My mom uses color-safe bleach.
Which people? <+++++> The ones who could disburse the money.
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet. <+++++> I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning. <+++++> Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson.
That's right. They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment. The one I left for you at the club was a copy. <+++++> Was I a really busy guy? Did I do Tick too?
I don't think the fire people can touch him out there. <+++++> How's he doing?
He was a failure, too. <+++++> You're not a failure, Dick.
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say? <+++++> I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor.
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas. <+++++> Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
What for? <+++++> I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
And the passage to the barn? <+++++> Yes.
What are you talking about? <+++++> Kathryn. Did you hit her?
Why don't you try? <+++++> Me... Goffredo, you're mad! He's mad.
Great? <+++++> Yeah.
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you. <+++++> I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.
If she asks me any question I want to tell her. I want to tell her everything I've done. <+++++> Well can you do me one favor and don't do that.
I don't want to hurt CharleyÂ I don't want to hurt you... <+++++> It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
I don't like horror movies! <+++++> How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.
Of course, luv. <+++++> Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina.
You're the best nurse I can think of-- <+++++> Nice *compliment*!
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive. <+++++> Finger! I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter! !
Bye Aunt Rose. <+++++> Bye Niece, Vada.
What a ridiculous thing to say. <+++++> I can't let you...
A what? <+++++> A thermonuclear holocaust, sir.
- looking. <+++++> Sorry - didn't copy.
Unlikely. <+++++> And because he's my friend.
You won't of missed much. <+++++> See ya downstairs.
Say what? <+++++> That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.
It ain't ever been done before, hot shit. <+++++> See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago. <+++++> Yeah, I think he is. Hey, Fred!
You quittin' too? <+++++> You're a pretty good player.
Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room? <+++++> Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'?
I came to see you, you look fine. We gotta go. <+++++> Vincent. It was nice to meet you. Visit again?
But... <+++++> Well, I met someone...
That's it? <+++++> That's it.
It's the only way we can be together. You know it's true. <+++++> My God.
But... the silverware? <+++++> I use it... to fight evil.
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you? <+++++> You're way ahead of me again?
Great crowd. <+++++> No such thing, baby.
Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper. <+++++> Early, sing me a song.
 <+++++> It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
You want me to keep that under the table for you? <+++++> If you wouldn't mind... It was on sale.
What? Say again... <+++++> ...Mason. I can barely hear you.
Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you. <+++++> Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
You're lucky. <+++++> Not luck. They don't want me.
I didn't get any chicken. <+++++> How come?
Then when? <+++++> ...Tonight!
I'd like to see you. Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim. <+++++> How does Mother know what I like to do?
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary? <+++++> Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty good. It's not like drawing on paper.
Yes, all right, I'll wait for you. Good-by. <+++++> I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
What if I call you Nicky? <+++++> My wife used to call me that.
Where's your mama? <+++++> She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
All of them do. We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb. And we'll be rich. <+++++> Good, because I checked your salary -- and it bites. How the everyday working-class stiff survives in today's economy is something I'll never ...
Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants. <+++++> That's a wonderful theory, Sean. It worked wonders for you.
We can explain, Colonel. <+++++> Explain what?
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die. <+++++> Did I?
Why? <+++++> He could give me some oxygen.
A while, I guess. <+++++> That must be really difficult.
Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call. <+++++> Thank you, Will. I'll do that.
 <+++++> Grounded for the rest of the year?
Two thousand a day, ten thousand a day - - people will pay it! And then there's the merchandising - - <+++++> Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich. Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
What kind of infection? <+++++> I don't know.
Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. Like some? <+++++> Would you mind opening the window?
And you like that? <+++++> Oh, yes.
You know that France has recognized the Soviet. <+++++> Unfortunately.
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal. <+++++> What? You think I'm running you up?
Name dropper. <+++++> I just think pictures should say a little something.
What do you want? I'm clean. I been clean a long time. <+++++> Really? Is that a fact... ?
Yeah? <+++++> Um, nothing, let's go?
 <+++++> Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
What? <+++++> They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man. Frankly, I'm disappointed.
Five hundred yards. <+++++> You have a man near it?
I only want one. <+++++> A foolish wish. And you, Quell?
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house. <+++++> Gordon? He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here. <+++++> Good! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
I'm a bit of a slob myself. <+++++> Yeah.
They turned you down? <+++++> They went for someone with more theme park experience. I woulda killed for that job.
Drinking alone. <+++++> Not much.
Yes. <+++++> Tell me about them...
You know what, you are never satisfied. <+++++> That's right, hand.
As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber? <+++++> I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge.
I didn't strain. I sighed. <+++++> I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer.
He was heavy, but we were real careful. But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere. <+++++> You don't. <u>Remember</u>.
Not too hard, is it? <+++++> Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
It's none of my business? <+++++> Yeah.
No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place? <+++++> Squatted it.
You don't want anything for your fifty cents? <+++++> No.
Sorry. Are you dating anyone? <+++++> You think that's really any of your business?
So you were having sex with the little fella, then? <+++++> Uh-huh.
Once Warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll want me back. It's a completely brilliant plan! <+++++> But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
We gonna crash? <+++++> I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
I out rank you, that's why. <+++++> In the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now.
Let's. <+++++> Yes.
All right, since I got you on the phone, let's talk about your character. <+++++> What character? I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second. I'm only in two scenes!
What unit were you with ? <+++++> None.
For God's sake don't start in on Heidi again ... <+++++> Did I say a thing against her? God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
Then leave. <+++++> Okay, okay. But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
You're late. <+++++> <u>I'm</u> dressed.
Next we're going to auction off your department store -- and your stable. <+++++> Why not?
Paul's grandfather. <+++++> Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
You were the last one to see Thorkel. In Octavius' hospital room. <+++++> So you've found Thorkel?
Keep talking, Yellow Bird... <+++++> 
Am I wrong? <+++++> Well--
You don't know who he is? <+++++> He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs. <+++++> That's refreshingly deviant.
How'd you manage that, then. <+++++> When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach. Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.
Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot? <+++++> Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook.
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off. <+++++> I don't know. I wasn't watching.
Her knee acting up? <+++++> A bit.
What? <+++++> I'll be there in an hour.
You look good, man. <+++++> Cool. See you later.
Francesca? <+++++> Yes! Hi.
Me? You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy. So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name. <+++++> And you've forgotten yours.
Clever fuckers. <+++++> What the hell's going on here! ?
No more water, you said. <+++++> Take it.
That's okay. <+++++> I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.
Buckaroo, come in...over. How does this damn thing work? Can anybody figure this lighter out? <+++++> No, sir. I think the flint...
Getting married. <+++++> To him? He's a sick freak.
From the psychiatric end. <+++++> I know. I read it. These desecration's in the churchÂyou think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
I will. <+++++> Goodbye.
It's beautiful. <+++++> People tell me that I am crazy. That my business will never work in your country. What do you think, George?
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start. <+++++> Okay. Well, you know, he's always been a nice guy and I like him.
Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick. <+++++> Just me.
And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat. Those good ol' days? <+++++> People had a choice, even if they took it for granted. And now they don't.
Joseph, now show him what happened today. <+++++> Yes, sir.
Hey Josh. <+++++> Are you ready to go?
She killed him. <+++++> Beth? Now you've got Beth killing people?
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp. <+++++> Are they gross or something, like guy stuff? Tell me.
Who asked any? <+++++> He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
You lost me. <+++++> C'mon, Max. First I watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up like you're Rocky the flying squirrel.
Why? <+++++> Because, I'll take it.
That's right. It's a crime. It is a crime. It's also very safe. <+++++> You're actually talking about this?
 <+++++> Yeah... I will.
Get car. Get car. <+++++> Very nice girl.
Come on. It'll be fun. We'll just bug out. There should be a bunch of people. It'll be fun I promise. <+++++> Yeah?
About ten kilometers. <+++++> Sixty Lira?
You got that shit right. <+++++> What exactly do you mean by that? I don't understand.
No. <+++++> You've been with someone!
Six seconds and I'm out. But he acts like he's curing cancer or something. <+++++> So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all? *
Brian? <+++++> Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
The... bullets? <+++++> Oh. The bullets.
Red flags man. <+++++> Not our problem.
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids! <+++++> Hey, Juno. Juno! Look at this one.
What are you doing? <+++++> James Looks Twice?
No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was... <+++++> Those cowboys messin' him up?
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers. <+++++> Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.
It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him. <+++++> Ten thousand sounds high.
Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running. <+++++> Yeah, yeah.
Shut up! Both of you shut the hell up! <+++++> We've got to do something. We've got to turn around.
Saving the treats for Bob? <+++++> Fun-ny. See you.
Yeah, but I don't know what. <+++++> [Beat] What's your name?
And end up in the papers? I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you. I'm sorry she got you canned. <+++++> Thanks.
You should come to rehearsals. I know they need people to work the lights and stuff. <+++++> No thanks.
The Holiday Hotel. <+++++> What room number?
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel! <+++++> We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
Also clean. <+++++> Age?
Can you fill me in here? <+++++> Sure. We have no idea what's going on.
An album. <+++++> Might be good for you.
I say we don't call it in. Under no circumstance are we to call this in. <+++++> Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay? We cover the bank, whatever. You and me.
Why don't you see Lester? <+++++> Your husband?
Can't say, sir. <+++++> Mrs. Kane liked poetry -
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York. <+++++> You must have me confused withÂ
How you doing? <+++++> I can trust my brain.
Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly... <+++++> For instance... It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
Ted. <+++++> Uh, huh...
What's all this for? <+++++> We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
Why? He's right in the groove. <+++++> He's so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type.
Sure -- I guess. <+++++> Terrific.
No...no stripping...as the hostess. <+++++> Hostess?
You sure? <+++++> Totally. I checked all the rooms and closets...
Hard to get up in the morning, huh? <+++++> That's right. How' you doin', Barney?
Haven't the faintest idea. <+++++> 
Back? <+++++> One of those business meetings, honey - always coming up in the middle of the night.
I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel. Who's in charge then? <+++++> I'm Ben Kenobi. Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
I knew it. What does she know. You want me to sing something? <+++++> That depends. How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
Madmartigan, I need your help. <+++++> My help? A great magician like you? You don't need any help.
What's on your mind? <+++++> Jon, it's the tenth. I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend. <+++++> I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --
This is the beginning. We're at ground zero. Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion. <+++++> i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
Why can't we? <+++++> I don't know the condition of the compartments. Depending on damage, debris...could be a fatal mistake.
Dylan, I gotta go. Forgive me? <+++++> Bye.
You're going to run again. And I'm not leaving until you do. <+++++> You're going to be very disappointed.
Am I not worth returning to? <+++++> Yes.
He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand. <+++++> When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.
You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life. <+++++> Really?
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat. <+++++> Why? For God's sake, why?
Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out. <+++++> He'll be really mad.
He has a point. <+++++> He does have a point. That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
Bottle. <+++++> You got it.
I'm not rich people. <+++++> Well, you sure do a good imitation.
Nobody's seen that. <+++++> If we get anything from the lab, we'll have it by noon.
Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz. <+++++> Me llama Eladio Cruz--Bienvenido a Tejas. [Welcome to Texas.]
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch. Like a bowstring. It was built from both ends. With no support in the middle. Beautiful. <+++++> Mmm.
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros. <+++++> Couldn't deal with it. So I split.
...dangerous. <+++++> Quite a getup for jacking...
Excuse much! Not rude or anything. <+++++> Nice ensemble!
This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is. <+++++> He told us it's in the Buick.
The sex is better. <+++++> Even though his dick is so big?
"American President" <+++++> How was it?
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary. <+++++> Oh, thank you, Herr Rick. Sacha will be happy to hear it. I owe him money.
Give me an ETA. <+++++> An hour, tops. Might be sooner.
Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P. ? <+++++> Senior exec.
Try again. <+++++> No... we have the two previsions from the twins right here, but...  ... I can't pull up any data from the female.
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy. <+++++> That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
...Who? <+++++> Marty.
Jim, itÃ­s over. <+++++> Ethan - IÃ­ve always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth. It can kill you.
I like my work. <+++++> I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money? <+++++> Sixty-five.
What color? <+++++> Gray.
Nobody's shooting nobody...come on, just let us through the hatch! <+++++> I'll kill you!! I'll fucking kill you!! I'll do it! I'll do it!
... Yes... <+++++> ... The needs of the many outweigh...
Five years, maybe, for a trial. Double that for the appeal. <+++++> 
Does that disturb you, James? Thinking about that little boy in the well? <+++++> 
Huh? Oh, okay, I'm sorry. <+++++> No, just so I can see ya, ya know. Don't have to turn my neck.
Where you going? <+++++> I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway. <+++++> Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
What's the matter? What's going on here? This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion. <+++++> I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs... <+++++> No, I mean, what is it FOR? What are you selling?
American currency. <+++++> This will take some time.
Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world. A nice little ratÂs nest. <+++++> Have some of the ratÂs nest caviar. From my own fishery. They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House.
You can't believe how much he's improved. <+++++> How many times have you shocked him tonight?
What now ? <+++++> I want to go to sleep for about a month.
For instance what? <+++++> For instance - you!
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living? <+++++> He and Jim Mason own the Tallow Works. But that's not where he makes his money. He makes most of it from his poetry.
Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away. <+++++> I sure as hell hope so.
Look, he forgot. I knew it. <+++++> No I didn't. Check out the Jeep. It's nice and dirty for you. But you might want to wait a minute.
Like what? <+++++> I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
No, thank you. <+++++> I'll be right here...just in case.
For when the time comes.. <+++++> For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
At least up there your piss will be worth something. You'll all be showering in it, right? <+++++> And drinking it. It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
You're going to take her off my hands? <+++++> That's right. I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
Uh huh. <+++++> Can I join you?
No one's gonna hurt you no more. <+++++> You think God forgives people like that? You think God forgives people like me?
Are you really ever coming back? <+++++> Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.
Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin. <+++++> I don't know where you were, penis envy.
I can't be nice to a fan? <+++++> Fine, Quincy.
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems. <+++++> What are you saying?
Either withdraw unto some private place, or reason coldly of your grievences, or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us. <+++++> Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze. I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days. <+++++> Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself. <+++++> Hey, you did the right thing. You wouldn't have stood a chance against these boys by yourself. They have eaten your ass alive.
Sure. <+++++> It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace.
Seventy-two miles an hour? You're sure of this? <+++++> Positive.
Why don't you just call him up? <+++++> What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had.
Diz, see what you can do. <+++++> I'm on it !
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old... Travels well though. You know, the world looks a lot better from up here. <+++++> The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
You mean Shelly? <+++++> Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
Yeah. <+++++> I want you to call Darryl.
Which I earned. Which I deserve. Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me. <+++++> Erin, you're a big girl. If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself.
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real. <+++++> Oh, it's real... as real as I want it to be, mamma...  ...look, see the magic in my brush strokes.
I prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location. Once Nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies. <+++++> So Theo and Nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed. A thing of beauty.
No, but there are four guys back there you might check out. <+++++> Thanks, buddy.
Who? <+++++> Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you.
Did he say why? <+++++> Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know.
That's not true. <+++++> Yes it is. Can we please not do that? Please? Cause it is.
Papa! <+++++> Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal. <+++++> Wha -- you don't want to know...
Hey, Mitch. <+++++> ...pit bosses, floor managers.
Phoned some friends, sir? <+++++> Yes. They want to help.
Should have seen him the first night. Son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didn't even blink. <+++++> You'd think he'd had practice.
Well, sometimes, some, uh... <+++++> I mean, it's jammed. If we went... um...
Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday. <+++++> He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
That was a fucking hollow point! <+++++> I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
Good-bye, Peter. <+++++> I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here. I'll call you. Later, Johnny!
Pay her off. <+++++> We don't have the money.
... He ought to put him in here. <+++++> It's too soon to move him.
He tole me your number and where you live. See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you. <+++++> Oh. Uh-huh.
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities? <+++++> Video.
I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long. They all knew you at that place. <+++++> What can I tell you?
Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities. <+++++> What are you doing?
I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position. <+++++> Fuckin' basketball game.
What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four. <+++++> I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there.
What do we do now, Everett? <+++++> Fire! I hate fire!
Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band. I don't care how big the deal is. <+++++> Okay, take it off, take it off.
I'm a deserter. <+++++> Are you now?
To help me. <+++++> Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
Crabs? <+++++> No, sir.
Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something! <+++++> Yeah. Crap with a star.
You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna? <+++++> For what?
And when the dancing's over? What about your future? <+++++> Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future. Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
I don't know. <+++++> The L.A.P.D.
This is a goddamn disaster. Let's just pack it up and go. <+++++> I want to see the tapes.
The whole thing Â painting. <+++++> No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every day.
You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch. <+++++> I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like.
Fifteen years? <+++++> Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.
Look at the way I live. <+++++> I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett. <+++++> Oh, yes. On the pier.
There are limits. <+++++> Yes... I guess I knew that.
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me. <+++++> No. It's the truth. I know what you are.
Were you with him, when... <+++++> Yes I was... He said his last words to me.
I don't know what to say. <+++++> I need your insight, your intuition.
He's a very private person, actually. <+++++> Yeah -- he doesn't happen to know that we went together, does he?
Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime. <+++++> There is one thing I need right away.
 <+++++> You mean he was colored?
That's my son Thomas's baby. <+++++> Well, it ain't your baby.
Don't be a c-a-t. <+++++> You asked me to dine with you tonight.
Alexander. <+++++> Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
Oh. Well. I think that can be arranged. <+++++> Not tonight. Bad timing. Sorry -
Hi, Jack. <+++++> Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service? <+++++> No more interviews. Besides, a doctor's coming over.
Es muy lindo, su coche-- <+++++> En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
So what. Infatuation is good, too. <+++++> And I didn't have an argument.
You hear about your old friend, Diego? <+++++> What about him?
You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too. <+++++> Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. <u>I'm Owens</u>. Right?
How about the new ending? Did you like that? <+++++> Oh yeah. Much better.
Who? <+++++> Old friend. Haven't talked to him in -- 911. Can I use your phone?
You hardly knew her! <+++++> True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
I am, Dad. Dad? <+++++> Yes.
Chili Palmer showed you my script? <+++++> Yeah, I was wondering why he should do that.
And what did I say? <+++++> A dog.
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?... <+++++> I took two thousand out of the savings account. That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
 <+++++> Dino...
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you? <+++++> I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
It's fine with me, Beverly. You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep? <+++++> We can be real quiet...
And Jonas? <+++++> He's why I watch Jerry. Jerry's the bait for Jonas.
I thought that was Peter Joshua. <+++++> I'm no easier to live with than he was.
But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment? <+++++> Trust me. You're gonna love it ...
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to! <+++++> Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
So whyÂd you let him go? <+++++> ItÂs complicated, Dad.
I hear you got money to spend. I hear you're interested in... interesting things. <+++++> Yeah.
But you know my favorite name? <+++++> I'm hanging up right now.
And you have this letter of intent? <+++++> Yes. That's why I wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little.
We have a renew-your-subscription offer... <+++++> We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
It is an emergency, isn't it? <+++++> Yeah.
What's that for? <+++++> Luck.
This all you want? <+++++> Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs. Then we can run for it. <+++++> No! I'm not going to leave Daddy with them!
Hi. <+++++> Have you guys seen Jeffrey? The limo never showed, I thought he might be here.
Oh, yeah? <+++++> Yeah.
Precisely. <+++++> Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
Actually, I'm waiting for someone. <+++++> What a coincidence, I am someone! Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
Jabez! <+++++> Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
I known Kip longing than you, man ... <+++++> Oooh, ain't you the lucky duck --
It's Sid! <+++++> I thought he was at summer camp!
I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry. <+++++> It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom. The money and the drugs. It's just goddamned beyond everything. What is it mean?
You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man. <+++++> Oh no.
I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you. Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours. <+++++> Shit, stop with the money! I never asked for a nickel. I was just doing this.
You're married! You've already got a husband! <+++++> He's a ghost!
You're kidding. <+++++> No.
Talk to him. <+++++> I will. But I must find the right moment.
All right, okay, let's talk. <+++++> In Breslau.
 <+++++> Sort of a Jack London style?
What do you do? <+++++> I sell biscuits to the Southland.
It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties. <+++++> Alright dad.
See me, sir? <+++++> You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant?
Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do? <+++++> I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.
I don't know. <+++++> I wouldn't worry.
Wait! <+++++> What?
This be it? <+++++> Y'all take American Express?
They give their opinions  in a respectful way. They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers. <+++++> And they loved Bear.
Why? <+++++> I'm getting that way, too.
What kids? <+++++> There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?
I'm going to take Asta for a walk. <+++++> He's just been for a walk.
You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am. <+++++> Yeah, well...
You haven't even heard from him? <+++++> Not a word.
...it doesn't matter. The rest of it just didn't happen. <+++++> What are you talking about. How do you know? I need her! I need her. She needs me.
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die. <+++++> What?
But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry. Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini? <+++++> Barzini.
If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand. I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though. <+++++> C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.
Don't you get it? They had their 2,000 years. Now it's our turn. <+++++> So all that bullshit about God and faith.
Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this? <+++++> Of course not.
Oh! My God...I've got to get you on the plane! <+++++> Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
I am, sir. <+++++> What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
It should be here any minute. <+++++> Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30. Sharp.
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound. You don't have to use your brain at all. <+++++> I have work to do.
What's your theory? <+++++> Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts. They don't concern me.
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her... <+++++> Who are you?
Jesus Christ. <+++++> Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools. <+++++> Mind if I have a look?
Nah, nuthin' on my end -- <+++++> -- Okay... hang on, I gotta move --
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past. <+++++> There are only two other alternatives for him.
Just be glad you're all right. <+++++> My brother is gonna shit.
My father needs a doctor. <u>Please</u>. <+++++> Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
What? <+++++> Not what. Who. What is for things. What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he?
Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty' problem? <+++++> Moving along -  A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here -  And a code breaking microprocessor here.
Surprise me. <+++++> What usually eats a banana?
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test? <+++++> 
Where'd you get your subscribers? <+++++> I put an ad on a computer bulletin board. I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
Don't feel too bad. Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her. You're better off out of it. <+++++> You look very grown up. What are you doing? You meeting your mom for dinner?
Lee, I've missed you, brother. I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure. <+++++> You must come with me for questioning.
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa. At ease, boys. <+++++> Likewise.
Only in the emergency room or when he was well. <+++++> Emergency room only.
I'm going to go back, Sonny, to the hospital. They're really nice people. They're really trying to help me. <+++++> That's good then. You've found something.
I just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran. It just did that... <+++++> He's brilliant. This one is brilliant.
Come on -- one drink. Whatta you say? <+++++> Drink this.
He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he? ! <+++++> Have you ever had one do this?
But that's where I'm different. go for the shoes first. After that IÂ <+++++> Smart aleck!
Soon. Soon. <+++++> Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
You did create me. <+++++> No. I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
No, no. I don't want to be idle. <+++++> And I don't want to have a washwoman for a wife.
Where am I at, man? <+++++> C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.
God. <+++++> The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone. <+++++> EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see her kid.
Yeah, sure. <+++++> I'll call her up.
Then why are you not with him? <+++++> You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you! <+++++> Please don't shout.
I couldn't prevent it. <+++++> I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son. <+++++> Tina, I'll be right back.
I'll even give you a warm up question. <+++++> Don't do this. I can't...
Uh. I'm showing off. <+++++> A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
Wasn't no problem a mine. <+++++> He was a con man, wasn't he?
You missed on purpose. <+++++> I didn't. I told you, I can't --
You wouldn't be putting me out. <+++++> ...Well, I'd be okay in here--
Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you. He's as handsome as his father. <+++++> You know my father?
 <+++++> Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age! <+++++> You liar!
I never said I didn't. <+++++> Chris --
I don't know. <+++++> You don't know.
Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us. <+++++> All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
If you would see him monument, look around you. <+++++> Show me the Pigs.
He knows what he's doing. <+++++> If he won't cooperate?
Not driving Jess, you won't. <+++++> What?
I think we can guarantee she'll follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego. <+++++> Best speed, Scotty...
Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh? <+++++> He' s confused--
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do. <+++++> So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him. <+++++> Well, what do you want me to do? Stand around like you chump and let that drooling infant wrap that Willet Creek Dam appropriation around my neck.
Thank Christ for that. <+++++> You are pretty naive if you think it is.
How' he doing? <+++++> Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
Stop it. This is beneath even you. <+++++> I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
Under a cloud without cause, I take it. <+++++> Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular.
But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people... <+++++> You've met her parents.
Money! <+++++> Yes, of course, -- money!
That makes you an expert I guess. <+++++> Too right....Now the other thing we've got to do is start clearing up the rubble. Can you make a start on that?
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me! <+++++> Would you like a tranquilizer?
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself? <+++++> Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
Like I said; I expected more from you. <+++++> It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?
Of course. Well, we should all go out onto the terrace. <+++++> Oh no, really. She has her book.
Not this twig, friend. I got plans. <+++++> Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life.
"60 Minutes," the television show? <+++++> Yes.
Huh? <+++++> Gold. You were going toÂ
I think so too. <+++++> I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend....
SING! <+++++> YES I'LL SING AND KNOW JOY EVERMORE
Five. I never wanted that stuff. <+++++> What did you want?
Gotta situation here. Where are you? Stuck in traffic? <+++++> Not due in for 22 minutes, sir. Watcha got?
Do I know any gigs? <+++++> Play a song then
I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere. <+++++> Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
I have. <+++++> Did you use it the night Marsh died?
Oh! That black box in our cell? <+++++> Shhhhhhh!
Can you face both? We are in a situation that is beyond morality. So: Leave with her. You'll see the transformation. <+++++> Into what?
Good day. <+++++> Good day.
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day. <+++++> Every day?
I guess I thought the name was familiar. By the way, you discussed with Senator Paine where the camp was to be situated and everything? <+++++> Well--no. I didn't. Why?
What, you're goin' off, too? <+++++> Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a favor, huh? Get my crewies buried? They were good guys who died bad.
...and the power to confront this cruel demon. <+++++> Amen
He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss. <+++++> I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
Why do you think you're here? <+++++> You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
What else is there to do? <+++++> You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
Prophesy to us, oh Christ! Who is it that struck thee? <+++++> I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that. <+++++> Neither do I.
Coulmier, you animal! <+++++> I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!
Well? <+++++> I'm sorry. I have to bring you to a cell.
There is no going back. <+++++> When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
It's Jason... <+++++> One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
The best or not. And that's a lesson. You get your typewriter yet...? <+++++> Um, no.
What about them? <+++++> They could eat you.
Finch! Get to the bathroom! Now! <+++++> Easy, tiger. What's in there?
Forty thousand dollars? <+++++> How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
It's a diary. <+++++> Be careful who sees it.
Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art. <+++++> Neither.
I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important! <+++++> But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down. <+++++> How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation. <+++++> [Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them. <+++++> There's a million places to hide around here.
Why are we stopping? <+++++> I need a break. I've been on a marathon run ever since I had the misfortune to strike up a conversation with you.
Bill? Lloyd? Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who? <+++++> Naturally enough, your understudy.
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth. <+++++> Of course, Remo.
Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right? <+++++> Gimme that Phillips right there.
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to. <+++++> What does that fucking mean?
My father just took me on a trip to Australia. <+++++> How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
Yeah, I had to go slummin'. See, a friend of mine's bein' framed. <+++++> You mean the rabbit? They got him cold.
They're framing me. <+++++> Why would they--
You want to do the life of Jesus? <+++++> Yes! Vibrant and modern and stark like a Picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning I We shoot the whole thing in the gallant American West--
The hull's imploding! <+++++> Rizzo! Can you hear me? !
You can't remember that -- ! <+++++> I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you -- <+++++> Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
We found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn. <+++++> What clothes?
Like little children. You okay? <+++++> Yeah. I got some stuff for your cut.
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff? <+++++> And I just liked you so much.
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you? <+++++> What?
You had to be a right-hander. <+++++> Noone orders southpaws anymore.
How'd you get that. <+++++> I got it. Hot off the press.
You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you... <+++++> I'll be fine, Dad.
Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy. But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention. <+++++> What?
But how can I do that? <+++++> If it were me, I'd reason with him first. Then, if that failed... ...I'd take more persuasive action.
Kip -- ? <+++++> Yeah ...
Welt...it depends, why? <+++++> Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.
Okay, Randy. Thank you. <+++++> All right, take care.
What else could it be? <+++++> Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in. Which makes it a peculiar choice.
Well? <+++++> Home free.
Howard-- <+++++> --remember Toronto, Harry.
How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double. <+++++> You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else. <+++++> Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well... <+++++> I'm glad you stayed. Thank you.
What do you want from me? <+++++> Something I guess I can't have anymore.
We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titanic must make headlines! <+++++> I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
A planet in Federation space... <+++++> Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.
I hate that word. It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen. <+++++> Fair enough.
You came for us.... <+++++> Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
It's . . . it's locked. <+++++> You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
Have a drink. <+++++> I've had a drink. Fatal.
Leave here. Don't do this. I don't want you here. <+++++> The hell you say. This isn't just about you any more.
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut -- <+++++> NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
Apparently, they've seen all our films. <+++++> They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
Okay... but I want you to know one thing. I've got to look great tonight, I mean I have to look great, okay? <+++++> Okay.
I didn't mention her once today. <+++++> Well, until now. Tend the pin.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something? <+++++> No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
It won't help you. You can't do anything about it. You can't change anything. <+++++> Change what?
I better get going. <+++++> You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry. Just call and make an appointment.
Kate? <+++++> She was hurt... pretty bad. Emmett, they took the little boy with them.
This is what he, or it... is after! The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain! <+++++> So what?
Not yet. <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Alf pulls onto the 15 FREEWAY. <+++++> Take us to Vegas.

Yeah. <+++++> Okay, what would you have done.
And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'. <+++++> Hey, get us a couple of drinks here, will ya? J. T. S. Brown.
Father, you can't let them take him... <+++++> Quiet.
Don't get mental, man. <+++++> Ya caught me in a bad mood.
Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon. <+++++> Fuck Kurt.
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am. <+++++> Nurse!
Who's side are you on? <+++++> I beg your pardon?
Thanks. <+++++> Glad to help.
Sorry, little man. <+++++> You wanna take my statement, I'll perform for you, gotta get paid though, gotta get PAID.
You didn't have that with you before. Prima non l'aveva con se. <+++++> It was late in arriving. But it's here now.
I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes. <+++++> You all act like two roosters.
Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life! <+++++> Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't know what you're talking about -- but is this Mr. Baldwin's wallet?
And Cole, next time I won't be late for you. <+++++> Next time I won't be scared of you.
What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run? <+++++> I'm fine, Lamar.
I love you, Jez. <+++++> I know.
Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone. <+++++> What do you feel about me?
I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you. <+++++> Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.
So it's you he was after! <+++++> Hello, baby.
When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick... <+++++> What's wrong with a magic trick?
That's right. <+++++> Man, you must be plumb outa your mind! You'll be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you're lucky.

Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know... <+++++> Just for the Symmetry of the thing...?

He is! <+++++> Look, it's important.

I am right! I know I'm right! <+++++> Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right.
Not true. I can use it to pick fleas from my horse. <+++++> By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.

I gave it to him yesterday. <+++++> You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we - <+++++> No. It's never going to stop, period.
Skiddy and Kit? I haven't seen them since that shitty pasta dinner on the cape. <+++++> They've got two monsters now. Both boys.
And how did Lamar become involved? <+++++> Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom.
Make what? <+++++> Anything.
Take your boots off. You're tan. <+++++> Mexico.
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then. <+++++> Goodbye, Bill.
Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell. <+++++> Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer. <+++++> Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
This is ridiculous. <+++++> How long would their shields be down?
I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom... <+++++> What is he? Afraid to leave you alone with me now?' He read the Tattler piece, didn't he?
But I don't know how -- <+++++> You press a button, Norman. It's not brain surgery. Here, go ahead. You only have 15 minutes to reset it.
Didn't have a choice. My car overheated up the road. <+++++> You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert. Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
None of this was here before. <+++++> Did you look? It was on the top shelf.
Our chaperon. <+++++> Pity your mother came, too ...
Oh! We ought to try and carry Dorothy. <+++++> I don't think I could, but we could try.
Now son, you tell 'em when it came from. <+++++> Be honest, I can't say I did it all myself. My grandma helped me get the words right.
Adele? You in there? <+++++> Yes.
Do you want to fuck now? <+++++> Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed. <+++++> WAIT A MINUTE! !
The police called us. <+++++> Yeah? what did they want?
Who is this? <+++++> Cici. Who's this?
You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard. He's fed up with you. Fed up! And I don't blame him! <+++++> Dick... Dick,..
Me neither. <+++++> What's gotten into you?
Sorry, Ms. Heller. I think they're used to me teaching. <+++++> People! Come on. "Parade" float.

Sounds like a Russian general. <+++++> Yavol.
We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar. <+++++> How'd you know my daddy?
All right. <+++++> 
You getting out too? <+++++> Yeah, thanks, it's ok.
Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke. <+++++> Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is... <+++++> Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house. And when he was there...at night...
The kid. Junior. <+++++> Gone.
You can't be serious. <+++++> That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work.
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho. <+++++> We gotta get out of here. Now.
Ripley... <+++++> She's alive. They brought her here and you know it.
Why do you feel that Truman's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world? <+++++> We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.
William - he asked me to meet him here. <+++++> Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me. Are you getting on? <+++++> What?
But they told me it was Ee gor. <+++++> Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
Jack? <+++++> Marcie?
--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet. <+++++> Isn't that interesting?
There's more, isn't there? <+++++> Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
Why are we leaving? <+++++> Those checks take forever.
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose. <+++++> Then what are you doing here?
Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea. <+++++> Do you?
You're trembling. <+++++> I never danced before -- in public.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman. <+++++> Can I get some stamps off ya? Did you fix the toilet yet?
You think so? <+++++> Could be.
Sure, it's on the red metro line you.... <+++++> No, by road?
How long? <+++++> By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?" Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd? <+++++> Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people- <+++++> Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo.
Your Majesty <+++++> There was a wager, I rememberÂas to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today.
It shall not happen again, Monsieur. <+++++> That's all right.
Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me. <+++++> Why can't you be serious?
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation? <+++++> I'm working on it, I've made three calls. I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
Understood. <+++++> Alright, Ray, you've got a deal. Pick your man and get going.
If you havenÂt heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear? <+++++> Have you found your man? Is that where he is?

Haven't any. <+++++> I'll show you the cabin.
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions? <+++++> What sort of questions?
Had some bad relationships, didn't you. <+++++> Not bad. Just regular. You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation. <+++++> And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
Then what is it? <+++++> History, Leonard. <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
pierdo. <+++++> Tu
Can we see? <+++++> You gonna buy?
It's a long story. <+++++> Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive. I've seen it a million times.

five months of peace is just what I want. <+++++> That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
Her own father...? <+++++> Such things have happened before, sir.
Ah, Charley and I are...Well, we're thinking about...I mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together. <+++++> You and Charley?

That's right. Not my style, Reggie.. <+++++> You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
HE'S GONE! <+++++> When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel. <+++++> I speak as I find, Archie.
You're late. <+++++> You know how I like to make a big entrance.
Of what? <+++++> Of telling you.
You know I hate the zap... when they die. It just brings down your whole day. Jeez, Tick. <+++++> Sorry.
No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is-- <+++++> She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
Nothing scary there. Sorry. <+++++> Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye. Hmm... Ahh...  Ooooo...

Well - ? <+++++> I'm not quite sure. Try it again.
All the time. That girl was like a rabbit. <+++++> I... I don't believe this...

Where are these toys of yours? <+++++> A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet. Here's the TV.
I don't have to. <+++++> Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch. Carl Stargher. That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.
Submit, bitch! Submit! Submit! <+++++> Suck my cock!
They'll have units blocking us up ahead. <+++++> That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
You know him? <+++++> I know of him.
Who are you? Who sent you here? <+++++> I'm your son. You're a hard father to find.
I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy. <+++++> It is right.
You say you perform in the Miami area? <+++++> Yes, around here. I was a mayishan in Cuba before I come here. Manuel the Mayishan was my name.

We are totally booked. <+++++> Oh really? That's great.
Listen to me, you banjo-dueling, country ass hayseed... I want my Nikes and I want them now! <+++++> You... think... I... stole... your... fancy shoes? I... wouldn't... be... caught... dead in 'em.
Like what? <+++++> One year he had a solar system named after her...
Do you know what he's been saying to her? <+++++> He's an actor, so it can't be good.
I stopped drinking. I gave up drugs. And I'm meditating three hours a day. It's the center of my life... <+++++> We are all impressed.
The girders of interlaced iron- work which stay the structure have an inclination of fifty-four degrees... <+++++> That's a strange angle.
No. Can't pretend that much. <+++++> I miss you, Jimmy.
Well he can't have gone far. <+++++> Can't have gone far? He's like a greyhound. He could be miles away.
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them? <+++++> The front gate would be best, General.
You dead yet? <+++++> No, Keeper.
I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... . <+++++> I'll take it out of their skulls.
Maybe you should... <+++++> I'm working on it! It's what I do. Quinn...Halloran. I'll wait.
Oh, it's not your fault. It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve. Something goes wrong inside. <+++++> You mean you can't fall in love?
You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump. <+++++> You got froggy on me a couple times.
I live with it every minute of every day. <+++++> I know that --
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car. <+++++> Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out of me! <+++++> I'm sorry...
You don't need to sit next to me right now. <+++++> Who were you talking to?
Ok...I'll wait. For now. But I'm going to need a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak. <+++++> How much?
I thought this look like your work. <+++++> Let's go. I'll brief you in the air.
How much of this shit do they have, White! ! <+++++> They must have got their hands on a test vial!
These are yours. <+++++> Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all. <+++++> Put that on your political resume.
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage? <+++++> I didn't say that.
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something. <+++++> Who was?
That's a shame, Bobby. A real shame. <+++++> And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined! <+++++> You are out of your league. SheÂs working with Renard.
You've just said you signed it. <+++++> Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
Okay. I think I'd better be alone for a while. <+++++> I understand. I'll go with you.
Again, I thank you. <+++++> I was talking about Miles.
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing! <+++++> snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner. <+++++> Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
Could be. Do you play the market? <+++++> No - the ukulele. And I sing.
You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance -- <+++++> You care for me. And you're concerned. And I have to start living my life again. I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
So where did I got right? <+++++> You're not a liar. Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
Well? <+++++> Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
I love you. <+++++> Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening. <+++++> Yes.
Did you hear? <+++++> What happened?
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter! <+++++> On screen.
You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake. <+++++> You think I'm fake.
What? <+++++> Maybe he'll get inside the tube -- where -- where they can't see him.
No. <+++++> You're sweet. I really wish someone had thrown a party like that when I was your age. My life might have been very different.
That's what I'm counting on. <+++++> But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
I'm training to.... <+++++> Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
Is that Jango? <+++++> No, this is Jack. Jango was hit by a UPS truck. Can you believe it?
All the dads are gonna be there. <+++++> I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho? It's tough enough as it is. <+++++> Oh, excuse me.
"Oh, tract housing, huh?" Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent." <+++++> "Beg to differ. This casket incarpratates, er, inporporates --"
Pardon me? I'm afraid I don't... <+++++> Cancel lunch. Make reservations at Campton Place for me and Mr. Butts.
Hey guys, why don't you show Tina the Dead Poets garden? <+++++> Garden?
That is our quest. You know much that is hidden O Tim. <+++++> Quite.
Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio? <+++++> He is not in the car. Sorry.
I was very charming. <+++++> There were many men interested in you?
I don't know. You tell me. <+++++> Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify.
Never cock. Just squeeze. <+++++> I love it when you talk dirty.
Where are we going? <+++++> Let's go hassle Josh.
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw. <+++++> Jack, I got no gloves.
Must be the Famous Curb Service Whore Â  House. You in the market Duke? <+++++> I done my shopping in Seoul last night.
I'm sorry, look, forget it. I shouldn't have called... <+++++> I told Bianchinni I would take a look. Is it that sink?
 <+++++> Three or four.
Think they're alright? <+++++> Of course! I would've heard.
Raziel! I transformed them all! I'm a magician! <+++++> You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them. That was noth- ing. Now change me.
All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest? <+++++> Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
Oh, yeah? Terrific. <+++++> Can I confess something?
Sir, the deadline is today. <+++++> Can we get around this, Al?
Lots of things. <+++++> Anything bad about me?
I saw him. <+++++> You saw my fa... father? When?
See, I told you! <+++++> Well, what the hell does that mean?
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut. <+++++> So why isn't it all bloody?
Are you going to the party tonight? <+++++> Yes I am.
Andy's house. Sid's house. What's the difference. <+++++> Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
Girl one of these fools has an FBI badge on him! Is this the one that was doing the inspection? <+++++> Hold up, hold up, I'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen...
None of you know anything about it. Now go. And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them. <+++++> I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
We were in some of the same classes. <+++++> Why didn't you tell me?
I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself? <+++++> My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners. <+++++> Argon is a lunatic! I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him. You heard what he said, Nigel.
I'm back from the dead. <+++++> Nicholas, okay... you're not about to shoot anyone...
I'm pleased. I really am. Really.... <+++++> No more sharks. I'll stay for another week, then....
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it. <+++++> I'll just take the gum.
Can you spare it? <+++++> Sure.
Hello? <+++++> Jaime? Where are you?
This is overwhelming, John. Are these characters  animatronics? <+++++> No, we don't have any animatronics here. These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
And Marina? Does she have a problem getting out? <+++++> None either. It's bizarre. It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.
It looks good on you. <+++++> Do you got something for me?
Good. <+++++> Is there anything to understand?
At what? <+++++> You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
We going somewhere? <+++++> Possibly.
We have it good, don't we? <+++++> All the things that happened to you before make you know that...
And when things get in your wayÂ or people Âyou just knock them asideÂ get rid of ThemÂ is that your idea? <+++++> ListenÂ get this straightÂ don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother.
Yes. <+++++> Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
Who was that French guy, anyway. <+++++> Oh, just some insurance guy.
All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse. Why? <+++++> Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
Slam it? <+++++> Just loud enough to wake me up.
Yes, please. <+++++> And you'll join me in a sambucca?
<u>He</u> could've killed Eduard. <+++++> You don't believe that.
We may go out for coffee after the meeting so don't expect us before midnight. <+++++> There's plenty of fruit.
Oh shit, the meltdown. It's spread to the tower. <+++++> We've got to get the nanobot.
What shall we get? The news! <+++++> No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
Oh yeah? Where's the bed? <+++++> Right over here.
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name. <+++++> Fred.
San Diego. <+++++> Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego. It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life! <+++++> I don't think so. It could have been.
Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute! We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing. <+++++> Have caviar if you like, but it tastes like herring to me.
Perhaps if we could meet your father. <+++++> There's just one question.
That's always been my problem. <+++++> And you've been extremely patient.
I guess we need to talk. <+++++> I guess so.
-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation -- <+++++> -- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
If you send me away now, Mara, I'll not come looking for you. <+++++> Do what you must.
No! I'm okay. I'm okay. -- sit down. All right? <+++++> Okay. All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.
If he could-- <+++++> "If he could" what? You mean your father?
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long. <+++++> Thank you for accepting.
Mike, it would be like trying to kill the President; there's no way we can get to him. <+++++> I'm surprised at you, Tom.
I'm Melanie. <+++++> You're late for breakfast.
Our little island seems to agree with you.... <+++++> I have my own little island.
What? <+++++> Dad!
And yet here you are. All celibate and reclusive. <+++++> With those big, dark, haunted eyes. As if you were harborin' some... unspeakably... guilty... secret.
What about me? Am I not even here? <+++++> Oh, hey Enid... So... we finally made it!
It's okay. it's okay. <+++++> My secret lover.
Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange. <+++++> I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
Yes. <+++++> Goddamnit!
Hello? <+++++> Are you still coming?
That chick, Erica? <+++++> Well, w-what happened?
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud. <+++++> Again.
No thanks. I'm off pills. <+++++> Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once.
You're pissed we didn't get credit? <+++++> No, that was the only semi-fucking smart thing he said!
When was this? <+++++> Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died. Things may be different now.
Okay. You don't mind? <+++++> I'll cherish ya.
Comrade Buljanoff... <+++++> Yes, Comrade?
This stuff. Love and marriage. I want to think about something else. <+++++> I've changed my mind. That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do. I will.
I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy? <+++++> Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that. <+++++> Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha. I think maybe I drank too much.
Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you! The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it! <+++++> But --
See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details. <+++++> Next week.
Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds. <+++++> ... my friend doesn't like it here either.
Welcome? <+++++> I'll tell you what, Mr. Martins.
That's why I joined this band. Safety first. Anything to get away from those bums. <+++++> Yeah.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy. <+++++> I hope not.
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going. <+++++> PROBABLY going.
Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story. <+++++> Why not? Oh shit... really?
Nine months? What difference does that make? <+++++> Good luck. You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
It's registered in my mother's name. <+++++> What the fuck possessed you?
That's a pretty brassiere. <+++++> Thanks.
Why do you say that? <+++++> Haven't you seen the cabana boy?
The best. <+++++> I love that car.
You think he'd of shot us? <+++++> When?
What? <+++++> Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me?
Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message. Not after the way we broke up. <+++++> What wouldn't make him suspicious?
Good evening. <+++++> Hi.
What about it? <+++++> It may have been affected.
Okay? Goodbye. <+++++> You've got to pick three more numbers.
What happened? Who're you? <+++++> Who're you?
L.A.P.D. <+++++> <u>Shit</u>. Someone beat us here.
 <+++++> All right, let's go.
What are you people doing out in the middle of the night? <+++++> I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
She wasn't in...you were al... <+++++> There's no witnesses...
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand... <+++++> Can you protect us?
That simple, huh? <+++++> Why not?
Sintag. <+++++> A synthetic opium analogue.
It's hard to say Capt'n. <+++++> Take a wild stab!
They're getting bigger. <+++++> Wait! There's a nice little one over there!
I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis. <+++++> Whatever. Just hurry.
...-damn phone. <+++++> Talk to me.
I remember. Hi Roberto! <+++++> What room have you got?
I mean, follow orders, sir. <+++++> With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.
What is your name? <+++++> Don't give her your name.
Forensic ballistics isn't an exact science, is it? <+++++> It most certainly is.
How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it. <+++++> There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
Out directing the search for the traitors. <+++++> When he returns, watch him. When he leaves again, you tell me.
Oh, Jean's okay. But there's three people up in Brainerd who aren't so okay, I'll tell ya that. <+++++> What the heck're you talkin' about? Let's just finish up this deal here -
The agents -- <+++++> They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are. If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
No. <+++++> Why not?
Well, yes, actually. <+++++> He always has two or three going...
Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then. <+++++> Oh come on! Why the hostility?
Really? <+++++> Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.
I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry. <+++++> Is that what you came here to say?
I think I'm floating. <+++++> Why would you be floating?
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders. <+++++> I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young!
No. <+++++> Have you had one?
You use needles? <+++++> No.
At night? <+++++> Yeah. At night.
No thanks. <+++++> No thanks. what does that mean?
You see us as capable of such a blow? <+++++> The Americans themselves have made it possible. We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.
What! Get married? <+++++> Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing. <+++++> When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you.
Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip. <+++++> But now you can't go.
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". <+++++> I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben. <+++++> Hi Sandy.
I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first. <+++++> M'hm. You're not gonna believe this, but-
And? <+++++> Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
Yeah. Me and Patchett go way back. <+++++> Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
Like the quiche? <+++++> Yes. Like the quiche.
No. That's okay. <+++++> Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
What a cozy little scene. <+++++> Kill them! Kill them!
Ain't that cute? They got his and her Pig-assos, son. <+++++> I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned! <+++++> Hey, what's your problem, friend? This is a business establishment with posted hours--
That's a matter of interpretation-- <+++++> We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
What was that? You got something to say, say it! Say it! <+++++> Nothing.
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand... <+++++> Well, maybe you better do that, then. You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt.
So, anyone talk to Janelle? <+++++> Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.
Most people are. <+++++> He's misunderstood.
Upstairs. Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving. <+++++> Surprise.
I'm ready. <+++++> Soon as I finish my coffee.
 <+++++> Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
No, of course not! Why? Would you care if we were? <+++++> Well, yes. From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single. Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight.
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment. <+++++> I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism. <+++++> Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
Don't just stand there, get help! <+++++> This can't be real...
Elektra? Running King Industries? IÂve known that girl all her life. IÂm not sure she knows what sheÂs walking into. <+++++> SheÂs not a girl anymore.
Mmmm -- <+++++> -- ass and legs --
Resetting the sub. <+++++> What sub?
No. We will find another way to locate the Fortress. <+++++> There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
You're gonna forget about me. <+++++> No I won't. I swear.
Where you going? <+++++> I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
You want to get into this now? <+++++> No, no, Caesar. Not now.
The floor was wet. She slipped! <+++++> Why was the floor wet?
Then it's malaria? <+++++> It's encephalitis B. He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon. Uh... Captain Worthington is paralyzed. Waist down. He won't walk.
Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone! <+++++> Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
What kind of noises? <+++++> Rattling. Rustling.
Well, spit it out. <+++++> The fact is... We'd like you to give Phil another chance.
What's that for? <+++++> Mom said I should.
The moon -- I dunno <+++++> I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea? <+++++> Yes.
How'd you know? <+++++> Educated guess.
It's what? <+++++> Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary. <+++++> Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries.
Michael - why would he want to hurt Stu...? <+++++> I don't know.
Do you have any idea what triggered this concern? <+++++> 
Why, you going to make me a better offer? <+++++> Than thirty-seven million pounds? Not really.
You could have said no. <+++++> Can't. Once I signed up.
Scully, get somebody to open this door. <+++++> Nice try, Mulder.
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you? <+++++> Because I'm the one who's single.
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him? <+++++> Mark is a really nice boy...
But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away. <+++++> Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
It's not just the cable system. It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net. It's everywhere. <+++++> Nick, what is it.
Uh, you guys are still-uh, you're still New Yorkers. <+++++> Yeah, I love it there.
You want to go home? <+++++> I don't have one.
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM. <+++++> They serve dinner on the flight?
How you doin'? <+++++> I'm all right.
So are you. I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back. <+++++> I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.
Carlos had some great rock. <+++++> I bet. That was our rent!
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need. <+++++> Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out... <+++++> Sure...
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie! <+++++> So boys, how was your first day?
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business. <+++++> He tried to burn the house down, said it was possessed by the spirits. Tiny was sleeping in the basement where the fire started.
Yeah, but... <+++++> Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils. He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips. <+++++> They'll love it in Pomona.
What...? Do I have so many already? <+++++> To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation. A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
 <+++++> So why did you come here?
He goes in there every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses. <+++++> So?
Like I said, Argyle...you're fast. <+++++> Mind if I play some tunes?
Coming to the pool for a swim? <+++++> Nooooo!--going to catch up on my reading. I'll take this one.
I'm in love with you. <+++++> Oh, come on...  What kind of an excuse is that?
Any idea when she'll be back? <+++++> None.
I was well compensated. <+++++> That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me. You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.
And that's all? <+++++> That's all.
Not so funny...if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means... <+++++> What's that?
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President! <+++++> Remember that First Liberty stuff we almost got nailed on?
What happened? <+++++> It's over.
You?! How about me? <+++++> You have two minutes and thirty- two seconds.
Thomas Franklin, an attorney. <+++++> An attorney?
Florist? <+++++> Yup.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life. <+++++> I don't want that. I want to be with you.
I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door. <+++++> Really?
Sir? What did he say? <+++++> Basically -- he asked me if I could unring a bell.
Is this what you seek? <+++++> Good... the slow blade penetrates the shield... but look down.
Hello -- hello... <+++++> Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
How much less? <+++++> Never would be plenty.
Well, I just thought I'd call. <+++++> Well, you did and she's fine. Thanks.
No, sir, you did not. <+++++> Damn right. And there's still a helluva lotta people out there who wanna believe ... That's the point, isn't it?
What was that? <+++++> Anonymous.
I ain't never going back to that school, sir. <+++++> You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse.
S'only got to hold for another few days. <+++++> Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim. <+++++> Boy, if that's what you think, I must've really screwed up my job as a father.
I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon. <+++++> Yes, I'm afraid he is. I believe he is riding. I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
What is. <+++++> You didn't plan on fucking him tonight.
When he does, you can crack him in the head... Okay? <+++++> Okay...
Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party -- <+++++> You think so?
You feel? <+++++> Yes.
Why should <U>I</U> kill him? <+++++> 
I'm telling you you can't. <+++++> But he wants me to come!
What the fuck you mean you burned it? <+++++> Never could save a thing.
He looks well enough for a mountebank. <+++++> Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
I heard you, I heard you. <+++++> Then say it.
...And she's with someone else. <+++++> The poor thing. I'll make some coffee.
My God! <+++++> We can go to another movie if you like, I don't care. I got money. There's plenty...
We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it. <+++++> The Core...!
Oh no... <+++++> He Ikea'd us.
I love Fort Holland. <+++++> What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband? Do you love that?
I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat? <+++++> No.
You be careful to. I'm going to miss you. <+++++> Shall we go away for a couple of days?
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch... <+++++> Sue!
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank? <+++++> No.
Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything. <+++++> They'd have a good neighbor, Jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more!
It doesn't fit. He doesn't want us to help him stop. <+++++> Who the hell knows? There's plenty of freaks out there doing dirty deeds they don't want to do.
FBI, Catherine, you're safe. <+++++> Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
Mr. Pickle! Did you see anybody in the booth next to you? <+++++> I... I'm not sure... ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
Do you want the car? <+++++> No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now? <+++++> Seven months.
Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange . <+++++> I see. Gold for ideas.
Too many pizzerias already there. <+++++> Then we could try something else.
It's over now, Dennis! Don't hurt anyone. <+++++> We'll burn this fuckin' place down! I got gasoline all over in here!
You know what? <+++++> What?
I say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together. <+++++> What do I want with a scar ?
No... <+++++> He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
This guy LaPlante won an award? <+++++> "For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
What will you have me do? Marry you instead? <+++++> To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams?
What'd you wish, George? <+++++> Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary.
Enough with the abracadabra. <+++++> Guess.
I told you, they hired me over the phone. I never met anyone. <+++++> Where'd you pick up your checks?
V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns... <+++++> ... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
Help! Help! I'm drowning! <+++++> I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
Do you want me to go...? <+++++> No, no, I'm just...
What about... now? <+++++> With them?
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh. <+++++> He's not here. We're getting divorced.
Something I can do for you? <+++++> The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch. I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye. <+++++> Try to get through dinner without them. You have beautiful eyes.
What's the plan? <+++++> Beats me. You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius.
Gordon? He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks. <+++++> Then what good is he?
Reel it in. He's only tiny, throw him back. <+++++> I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it?
We saw his show at the Luxor last night. <+++++> Vegas? What'd you think?
First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died. <+++++> Ma'am, I'm sure she was.
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper. <+++++> Proper? !
Rock? <+++++> See, you're not that out of touch. You're good.
Uh-huh. Double ought. <+++++> They'll give you a wallop.
Intense. <+++++> I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
I didn't see you this morning. <+++++> Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
But I wasn't. <+++++> And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite.
He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie. <+++++> I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning. I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so long? ! <+++++> Orson, please ... it's too bright
We'll have to let them go. <+++++> Surveilliance on them all.
We thought we were something, didn't we? <+++++> Yeah.
Say not here! Cuba! <+++++> What is it? A tribe? An island?
You. What' you're doing -- <+++++> And what am I doing?
Are you Elijah's pimp? <+++++> What?
This is it? <+++++> Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
I thought you said you weren't a very good liar. <+++++> I lied.
I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean. <+++++> You need a ride?
...four years ago... <+++++> Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
Yes? <+++++> Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
 <+++++> 
I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy? <+++++> Probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night.
When I tell you it's open. It's open when I tell you it's open! <+++++> Okay, Auggie, I got it. You don't have to yell.
I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen. <+++++> Well, like what?
Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in. Like an old boxer. <+++++> I can't hide anymore. I breathe like a dog. I lose my balance. Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night -- <+++++> The prom? Kat has a date?
Room 237? <+++++> You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?
OK...Marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas. And that's Switzerland's country code. <+++++> A bank?
She said, your name was Alvy Singer. <+++++> Whatta you mean? Me?
You're not? <+++++> It's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the Venezuelan syndicate has a daughter, and -
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool. <+++++> Mama mia. Just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation.
You still should've moved. <+++++> I like it here. Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that. <+++++> "Klaatu barada nikto."
Hello, Miss Channing. <+++++> My husband...
I told you, use less powder. <+++++> But you won't get that splatter effect.
Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend. <+++++> That has the added virtue of being true.
Because I know what it says. <+++++> Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
Yeah Jack, her assistant... <+++++> Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college. I almost married her...
Proceed. <+++++> But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.
I said I was too young to drive. I didn't say I was stupid. <+++++> What's the matter with your leg?
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that? <+++++> Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
And we got rid of the red head. <+++++> Jake? Customs?
Come on, snap out of it. Diz Moore-- that rarest of companions--is here at your side. To genteel crime, kid. <+++++> And to Don Quixote!
Stop it! You don't deserve the Green Destiny. <+++++> Not another lecture! On guard!
You like this, don't you. Showing me... this. <+++++> I hate it. But you gotta know, buddy. A lot of strange things happen in this world.
Honey, go back to sleep, please! <+++++> Goddammit! I been sleeping for three years!
~hex! Alex, are you oKav? <+++++> Yes. Good was done this .....
So do I just follow you? <+++++> Yeah, follow us.
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when -- <+++++> I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19.
We have to get going. <+++++> I am not flexible on this.
No. She tink Lobo is waste of my time. Lobo don't talk. <+++++> But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
You don't know that. <+++++> You don't know he isn't.
Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch. <+++++> I told you, 'watch it'.
Because, you know why. You know. <+++++> Because your a virgin?
I'm playing to win. <+++++> Winning isn't everything.
...Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior? <+++++> I do.
And so I am. <+++++> And this is the return you make for his kindness!
Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening. <+++++> "What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . .
To show that we're negotiating. <+++++> All right ... send them the guard.
And this innocent child. <+++++> Don't worry. He won't be forgotten.
Or, is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into <u>their</u> mouth? <+++++> Great, Lisa. Thank you.
I like my horizons narrow. <+++++> Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla. <+++++> I didn't know that.
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth? <+++++> He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered? <+++++> He had to.
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe. <+++++> That's not sayin' much.
I been watching you. You done good. Invested wisely. Respectable businessman now. Just like you always wanted. <+++++> And you? Still a pig. Just a much fatter one.
They're distracting us? <+++++> From what?
You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians. <+++++> I didn't.
Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place. He'll do it for me. <+++++> The drugstore's closed? What the hell time is it?
Now it's almost double. Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies. <+++++> Any way we can do it better?
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work. <+++++> The point is, they want a man inside.
Remember, we had that thing. <+++++> What thing?
A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time. <+++++> It'll never work.
But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it. <+++++> Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off. Why should they?
Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day. <+++++> Yeah? And if she was ugly?
Ok. Listen. You: c'mere. <+++++> No.
I kinda thought so. Felt like it. <+++++> Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
How'd the two of you hook up, then? <+++++> Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
A lot of people died. <+++++> I've seen a lot of people die before.
End a April. <+++++> Any others?
You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture. <+++++> I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did? <+++++> Yeah, tell me. Tell me all of it.
I know a lot of them aren't there. But this is real, isn't it? You're taking me home now? <+++++> That's right, buddy.
No. So. Is it working out with Ian? <+++++> Rob. Don't be childish.
Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round. <+++++> That is a marvelous image, Walter. Because by going in circles we find the things we missed the first time around.
Elvis is on ice again. <+++++> Okay.
Muley! Where's my folks, Muley? <+++++> They gone.
So early? <+++++> Rough day. Good night.
Oh, how did you get burnt-out? <+++++> Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
Tim, what are you talking about? <+++++> Ask your girlfriend.
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR? <+++++> Oh...
That's one - way of looking at it. You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'. <+++++> Well, there is that ...
My mom wasn't a goat? <+++++> Try an angel.
 <+++++> 
So now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep? <+++++> Open your eyes once, idiot. It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
Oh, sorry. With the light always on, it's hard to tell. <+++++> It's okay. Last one.
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy. <+++++> It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood.
A moment. <+++++> But --
Huh? <+++++> Big night coming up?
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this? <+++++> We'll find out soon enough.
You feign ignorance? <+++++> WHAT HAPPENED?
I'm sorry. Really. What do you want me to do? <+++++> I don't know. Smile. Sneeze. Something. You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.
I know it, man. Hang on. <+++++> Jesus Christ.
Enlighten me. <+++++> Because he could. He did it because he could. What other reason were you looking for?
-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka. <+++++> Poor Harry. Always desperate for attention. What about the bunny?
You mind? I'm trying to eat here. <+++++> So am I.
Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself! <+++++> Well that's the only way it's gonna happen, man. Do it! Come on, you want to do it.
Sit down, I'm going to need your help. <+++++> What's the matter?
How so? <+++++> 
I miss my kids. <+++++> They're at college. Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.
I'm here. Shut up. <+++++> Come out come out wherever you are!
Really, this isn't funny. <+++++> OK, OK, I'll give it back.
Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine. <+++++> That's going to do it, right? I'm going to be okay.
In English. Sami doesn't speak French. <+++++> Where are you from?
You're calling the shots. <+++++> You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
County. I was in for fraud. <+++++> You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work. <+++++> "Punks", huh?
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you. <+++++> Jealous? Of me?
What happened to your toe? <+++++> I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
There's a man downstairs. He brought us eggs. He might stay. <+++++> Why? Can he lay eggs?
I know, I know, it's just... <+++++> Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.
I'll take it. <+++++> No -- that's for me to do.
Fit? You want to check my teeth. Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner? <+++++> If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
Well the answer is that I don't know either. We haven't done it yet. <+++++> Never?
What? <+++++> Could we have intercourse?
Delicious! You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity! <+++++> Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923. <+++++> Ya got a good mind for dates.
When we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours. <+++++> I couldn't get into the girdle in two an' a half hours...
Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much time to demonstrate your new Q toys. <+++++> How is old Q?
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that... <+++++> Why did you do that???!! !
They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all. <+++++> Yeah, well, that's enough.
Yes, Monsieur. <+++++> A champagne cocktail, please.
Well, just get it off your chest, son. <+++++> That's not what I mean. I've never done anything right.
Sure. Maybe coffee. <+++++> Phone's out. I hope the pipe's --
Mickey, you're off the hook. You should be celebrating. <+++++> Can you understand how meaningless everything is? Everything! I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless.
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay? <+++++> I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
I think they're gonna arrest me. <+++++> I don't want them to arrest you.
I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside. <+++++> We're working on that...
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case. <+++++> He is very good.
And you think this justifies killing innocent people! ? <+++++> To have stopped this creature? Yes!
I want to meet them. <+++++> We'll do that.
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger. <+++++> Dr. Jones -- I want Nurhachi.
No problem. <+++++> You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?
Who told you? <+++++> That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection.
Yor dad picking the music again? <+++++> Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
Yep. <+++++> Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
Oh--you are! <+++++> Then you *did* say it.
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but -- <+++++> And I don't want to invade your privacy --
I'm a homicide detective. Where were you last night? <+++++> I was here, hosting a party. Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
You're asking questions that don't have answers. You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else. <+++++> I don't think that's true.
Now that's teamwork. <+++++> I should have let him kill you.
Well I might go to Dartmouth. <+++++> Dartmouth? !
I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank. <+++++> Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack.
Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own. <+++++> Then blame the one who made her...
But I have to finish this.... <+++++> Come on, that shit can wait.
Did you? <+++++> No.
Cyril didn't like it, either. <+++++> Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?
...I'm sorry....? <+++++> ...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you? <+++++> Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
Dr. Mumford. <+++++> Mr. Cook.
No, you're not calm. <+++++> ...I will let her in the house for five minutes if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens not to want to leave.
It has to be a full character's name. <+++++> They called her 'Lizy' in the book... Sorry I was late. My jeep died on the way over from the paper.
I'll call them from the road. <+++++> Do you love me?
What do you want it for? <+++++> To throw out of the window.
Why? <+++++> You don't have the stomach for it.
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different. You married. <+++++> I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped! <+++++> Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he? !
'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.' I never would though. Not really. <+++++> Why not?
-- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green... <+++++> -- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
Would you like to meet him? <+++++> He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
Well, I'd like to read them. <+++++> No. We're going to lock this up and --
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest. <+++++> Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
Plotting our new course. <+++++> New course? You have no authority. What's going on here?
They will be ready. You guys do your job. <+++++> I'll take care of my end.
Alan? Where are we going? You see something? <+++++> Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common. <+++++> Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
Gus, have you ever been in love? <+++++> Leave.
How could he have left without his keys? <+++++> Two sets. I don't know. Maybe they're not even his.
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes <+++++> So you think time travel is possible? For people?
Not a coke or anything? <+++++> No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone. <+++++> Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
Who is the best. <+++++> Nope.
Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings. <+++++> What's it say?
Abbott? <+++++> He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
An accident? ! <+++++> It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
Thank you, John. <+++++> You're welcome, Grace.
Want some bridge mix? <+++++> Oh, no thanks ...
But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back. <+++++> Where do we look for little lost Puff?
I feel like a bootlegger's wife. Look! <+++++> You know what we're going to do? We're going to shoot the works. A whole week in New York. A whole week in Bermuda.
They look stupid. <+++++> We had Davy Crockett hats... They made a fortune.
Nothing happened. <+++++> Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need. <+++++> You're taking me home!
Fair enough. <+++++> Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man. She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning... <+++++> Come on. You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
We'll do it together. I'll clue you in. Timing's got to be right. The old man says it's up to Joe. <+++++> 'It's up to Joe'? Those were his words?
But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what? <+++++> An hour.
Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break. <+++++> I see that.
Not bad. Briliiant, actually. You come unarmed, and alone. Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150? <+++++> Give or take. It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last.
Who wouldn't? <+++++> First rate, ain't it?
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody. <+++++> Did you get his number?
Why should I? <+++++> Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley.
To his hotel? <+++++> Shit, Jeff!
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing. The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly. <+++++> Must I hear this?
Howls he getting on with the family? <+++++> Ah. Fine. It's good. It's great.
You know what's good for him? <+++++> To win.
Pretty impressive, huh? <+++++> It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
You might find the truth rather hard to understand. <+++++> Then you can speak slowly.
Why are you doing this? You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people. <+++++> Pain? Pain is just a state of mind. It's something you learn to live with. I have.
Only squares and nerds go to dances. <+++++> What are you?
Yes? <+++++> I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
Samantha. <+++++> What'd they call her in high school?
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin. <+++++> What did you say? I'm sorry...
Doctor Jacobson? <+++++> Yes?
Would you guys... <+++++> No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.
On average forty million. <+++++> 'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?
Yes, I'm pretty sure I would. <+++++> That's very good news. The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
Yes. Do you want... <+++++> I have no life.
You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya! <+++++> Don't talk like that to him!
Where's the girl? Miss Stone. <+++++> She's remaining in her room. She isn't feeling very well. Now please go on without me. I eat very little.
Get real. I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on. Now that it's over, all bets are off. <+++++> If that's true, then why'd you save me?
Are you awake? <+++++> No.
Next to your father? <+++++> My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir. <+++++> I know this has been painful, Spock. For me too. Thank you.
Here we go again. <+++++> He's really cute!
That's right. <+++++> I should've known. What's the Chief throwing you?
...my love... <+++++> ...they asked us to dinner. How can we accept if we cannot <u>return</u> the...
Clear? <+++++> Perfectly.
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout? <+++++> Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it. <+++++> You'd recognize it if you tasted it.
I still don't see you. <+++++> We're waiting for the light to cross the highway. It just changed. We're in a grey van.
Just in dreams? <+++++> Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway. <+++++> Why not?
When are you going to learn? <+++++> I did I killed a man.
Secret Service! <+++++> Don't move!
Ms.  Mitchell. So nice to finally meet you in person. <+++++> The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you. Now if you're all cleared? You can follow me then.
I'm trying hard to follow you. <+++++> 
I forgot. <+++++> Buffy, what is your sitch? You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
Yeah, that's right. <+++++> We need to get out of sight. Come down to my suite.
That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is! <+++++> But where did you get it, Amy?
Um. <+++++> Used to be against the law, didn't it?
I'm still into all this stuff, you know. Haven't you ever seen my show? <+++++> I have. That's why I didn't call you first.
Land of the free... <+++++> Home of the brave!
This just came in, over the transom. Fella, works for a Plastic Surgeon, Argentina. Look here: <+++++> ...what'm I looking at...?
Shoot him. <+++++> The American theater doesn't need people like that.
You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy. <+++++> See if these two are my friends.
What, Ben? <+++++> I wish Uncle Ethan was here. Don't you, ma?
I don't know... I think I missed something. <+++++> Like?
Commander, these are some of the most famous people in Starfleet! Admiral Kirk, my God! <+++++> Good for you, Lieutenant.
Go onto the next question. <+++++> Good advice for the French, not for the English! Do you think God hates the English?
I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope. <+++++> If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope. <+++++> Glad to meet you, Jill, Mr. Pope.
I guess there's probably a story behind that. <+++++> There is, but it's not that interesting.
I know. That's why I went. <+++++> But then you told her you were home.
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--? <+++++> For one week!
You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds! <+++++> You forget -- time travel is instantaneous. The time machine would melt, but you would have already travelled through time.
Hell, I need this crazy existence of mine. Like I need the plague, right? That's what your thinking. <+++++> No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
Remember that. <+++++> Please...
He's lying. <+++++> You two-faced-bastard.
Fletch, this is dumb. <+++++> You don't have to run with me, Crease.
What does that mean? <+++++> Something I heard someone say once.
Yeah, I get it. Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp? <+++++> Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo? Okay?
What reason? <+++++> Why backdrafts.
What did you think would happen? <+++++> I don't know.
I'll be watching over you. <+++++> Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
That's good. <+++++> 'Kings and sixes The pot affixes'... Poetry. I learned that at my grandma's knee.
You bastard. <+++++> It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
Hi Mom. <+++++> Don't "hi Mom" me. What are you still doing up? It's past one!
No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going. <+++++> Whatever you say, darling.
What are we going to do? <+++++> What do you mean what are we going to do?
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard. <+++++> I know. But last summer, I worked for a day in Zelazna Brama Square. I saw someone I knew. A singer.
You know. Look at me like -- like I look at women. <+++++> Don't be ridiculous. I know a real man like you would break my neck if I so much as laid a hand on him.
Light? <+++++> That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light. This bucket of blood.
I don't understand. It wants us to play the game. It's been taunting us ... <+++++> Put in a quarter.
The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks... <+++++> Maybe try the opposite of that.
What happened? <+++++> What happened is that Jimmy went to meet a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back.
Clench your teeth. <+++++> Wh... what... ? !
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants? <+++++> Humiliated?
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it. <+++++> Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
Did you see her? <+++++> No, sire... I was asleep.
You'll think about my offer? <+++++> You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it. If I spoke with him.
I've got to see you. <+++++> But not now.
If the pay's right I'll do it. <+++++> It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.
Why? <+++++> Because I'm so horny.
Up a dime. <+++++> The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
What? <+++++> If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
Oh my God... <+++++> I know... I know... It's difficult for all of us.
Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene? <+++++> Iced coffee.
We'll keep going, Roc. <+++++> You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever.
Where's Snow? Did you call him? <+++++> Yes.
I'm sorry, alright? It was just a stupid joke. <+++++> Will, sit down...
I've no choice <+++++> If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
You are. <+++++> Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent. <+++++> Your boast is a bigger mouthful than your roast, Magnificence.
Do you pack a gat? [11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly. <+++++> Huh?
Everybody that she plays with dies. <+++++> I know what that's like.
Sorry about your loss. <+++++> I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one.
Eight. <+++++> If he don't know, nobody knows. Told you it was eight.
Situation. <+++++> This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
Oh, you are... <+++++> I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
What's wrong with it? <+++++> You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Tight fit. <+++++> Best kind.
It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake. <+++++> Returned it? Where? To the video shop, Tommy? To the fucking video store? So every punter in Edinburgh is jerking off to our video?
No, no. This will not do. Anger is what you feel. <+++++> But I feel The Force flowing!
Watch this! <+++++> What?
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost! <+++++> Sh, sh! Fuck you!
Yes, you! <+++++> Well, you do have the dress.
Hundred and Sixty First Street? That's Yankee Stadium. <+++++> Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers are playing a double-header against the Red Sox.
Why should you think I wouldn't be? <+++++> Why should you be? After all, six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater-
I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it? <+++++> I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations. <+++++> You never spoke so well of him.
How? <+++++> I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while. <+++++> Er ... alright. For Christ's sake don't lose it. Here, you'd better sign for it.
From citizen high to citizen low. <+++++> I don't care.
We're going home. We're going home together... <+++++> We have no home. We're vagrants. N'each man's hand's against us.
All three -- in chronological order. <+++++> You must hate your brothers.
Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina? <+++++> I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what.
You can't take a guess for another two hours? <+++++> No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains.
What do you want to do, Scott? <+++++> I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
Bullshit! Talk! <+++++> Nick! !
But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse. <+++++> I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
Have a heart gentlemen. Their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion. <+++++> Hey! Where are the brakes?
What? What don't I get? What don't I get? <+++++> I don't know, dude.
Damn... Are you alright? <+++++> They took my daughter.
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side. <+++++> Well, that's all part of it.
Why so many? <+++++> Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men.
Guess who? <+++++> When...
Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand. <+++++> Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
We have to get out of here. <+++++> It's alright.
I have a better plan. You want to hear it? <+++++> What?
Do you have something to bring me down? <+++++> No problem.
Do you love him? <+++++> I like him a lot.
...colonel? <+++++> Have you I.D. 'd the bodies?
Hello. Whenever there's a pretty woman around, erÂ  This is my nephew, Ted Sheldon, Miss Mitchell. <+++++> How do you do.
But... How is it you can see me? You can all see me? <+++++> What d'you mean?
Are you relieved? <+++++> Yes, but --
Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away... <+++++> I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
-- Is what? <+++++> 
You're precious to me, Rose. <+++++> Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.
What did she do? <+++++> She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.' 'Kathy Costello...'
...Geez. <+++++> Yah.
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"... <+++++> No, no, of course not.
No, I didn't. <+++++> Voices from an old dark house!
You pay great attention to small things. I hide these as I hide all my books. Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible. <+++++> I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend. <+++++> Who?
The tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds... <+++++> Eject the core.
I wanna hear about it, George. <+++++> Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?...
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all. <+++++> You're on duty. Keep your fucking mouth shut. Go in and get some sleep.
You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side. <+++++> We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey? <+++++> Yes. Chauncey is fine.
Ed Smythe, yes. <+++++> Okay. Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty?
What's wrong. <+++++> Forget it. Forget it.
 <+++++> You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
from now on it's going to be share and share alike"? <+++++> Emphatically not, sir. The prospect terrifies me.
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident. <+++++> Don't even try to remember.
But they're somebody's children. <+++++> Are you running a business or a charity ward?
What about in the mean time? Not the in between time? <+++++> You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
Take this, Joey. It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there. <+++++> We've spent everything on these operations. Is it really worth it? We've pawned your mother's wedding ring. The kids have no winter clothes...
Oh. This is... WeÂd arranged to meet tonight and IÂm due to return to Paris tomorrow... <+++++> IÂm sorry...
I know. I go with you. <+++++> I couldn't get you in.
Charming guy, Basil. Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but- <+++++> -All but one out of a hundred, I know. All left to be led like donkeys back home. Now if you will please-
For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green. <+++++> Are you sure we should be driving like this? In broad daylight and everything?
She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof! How is she? <+++++> I don't know. I think she's breathing.
Look, what I'm trying to say -- <+++++> Look, what I'm trying to say --
What is wrong, my darling? <+++++> Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said. <+++++> How long had that been going on?
What's up? <+++++> Just watching you.
I tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out -- <+++++> I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that! We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
Now what? <+++++> Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment. <+++++> Well, perhaps you can help?
I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out. <+++++> I didn't mean to say anything bad about you. I know you're good. You didn't mean no harm.
We're going to win this. <+++++> Walk in the park. And thanks for the 'we'.
Where's the office? <+++++> Help me, goddamnit, we can get the disks later!
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king. <+++++> Shoulda guessed.
I know. <+++++> You' new here, man! See you, boys.
What's wrong? <+++++> It's hot in here.
I'm not through with you yet. <+++++> Yes, sir.
Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you? <+++++> Marion. It's a book.
I'd forgotten. <+++++> Tell me where Jacqueline is -Â we've got to find her.
Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds. <+++++> Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
Fancy seeing you here, Bob. <+++++> Yeah. Hey, Clay.
Dan'l Webster? <+++++> Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
I'm here. <+++++> Do you think the film could have cost that much?
Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him? <+++++> Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun.
You know what? IÂm not having this conversation right now. <+++++> Sure, disappear. WeÂve been walking away our whole lives.
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet. <+++++> The Multi-Jurisdiction Task Force:  read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda Drumgo.
No... We're trying to save Heller. <+++++> ...So you knew all this and yet y--
But you might. <+++++> I might.
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record. <+++++> You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
Wait -- <+++++> Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory.
Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife. <+++++> No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
Can't I just go with you guys? <+++++> Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.
Stop. <+++++> I'll tell him someone else told me.
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back. <+++++> We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
This is California. The richest, most populous state in America. And growing like a sonofagun. <+++++> I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.
Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean? <+++++> I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse! <+++++> Ben, are you there?
You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account. <+++++> I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
...shit. <+++++> Well, all the same. If we get to Missoula, help me find a car. I'd appreciate it. Then...you can...
And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway. <+++++> So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.
You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them... <+++++> I'm a cop from New York.
Mrs. Mulwray? <+++++> Yes, Mr. Gittes?
And you were drilling these holes...? <+++++> So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
Stop saying things so loud! <+++++> Oh! The virgin has spoken! SARAH Stop it!
Ah. <+++++> Second chair.
What's the matter? <+++++> I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him. <+++++> They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
 <+++++> The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that!
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ... <+++++> Next assignment?
Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird... <+++++> Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
Judy -- <+++++> It's a horrible idea! Is that what I'm here for? To make you feel that you're with someone that's dead?
Exactly. Why not bring them? <+++++> Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.
A non-terrestrial intelligence. <+++++> Non-Terrestrial Intelligence. NTIs. Yeah, I like that better then UFOs. Although that works too... Underwater Flying Objects.
H-h-how's it g-g-going, Mack? <+++++> Just fine, Billy boy, just fine. Full of piss an' vinegar! They checked my plugs and cleaned my points...
I'll be God damned if you will. <+++++> Oh, Jesus! You want to be a martyr or a hero or what?
Again! ! <+++++> NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!! !...
Peter, I believe in you. More to the point, I read your new script... um... <+++++> "Ashes To Ashes?"
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us? <+++++> First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
Erin. Who? <+++++> I don't know. I found him lying there.
Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it? <+++++> Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . .
No. <+++++> Through someone else?
Hi, whatcha doing? <+++++> Just thinking.
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at. <+++++> Maybe you will after you've thought it over.
Oh, you-you have that one? <+++++> Yeah.
He's not! He's not! <+++++> Who's not?
I'm only good at making people laugh. <+++++> That's all right; we all laugh here, but not at you; I'll see to that.
Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi! ! <+++++> <u>Lugosi</u>??! Didn't be pass on?
'Sides, car's right outside. I'll be seein' ya, Jer. <+++++> Pete...
What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants? We both use that body. <+++++> Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
He did? <+++++> Yes, I'm sure. What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style.
Yes. <+++++> How did they get it away from him?
Thank you, ma'am. <+++++> I hope everything is settled.
Yeah. <+++++> Why?
I hate him. <+++++> I know. It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO! The Fonzie! The crazy breakout character! The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes! <+++++> George, I hate sitcoms.
Thank you. <+++++> Thank you.
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here? <+++++> Are you kidding me? What's to like?
And this is Stacy. <+++++> Stacy.
Industrial refuse. <+++++> Garbage man?
Nice hops. <+++++> The corner. Anarchy 99.
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think. <+++++> Think the tide's with us?
 <+++++> You sound worried.
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer. <+++++> Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination. <+++++> I'm good at that.
Where did you learn how to drive like this? <+++++> Like what?
Don't get sidetracked! How does he get back to the States? That's the point. Does he have any problems? <+++++> None! The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.
No. <+++++> Were they pretty?
Everybody in? <+++++> I guess so.
Go. <+++++> EXT. DAM - DAY.
Hmm..Smells good. Cheers! <+++++> What did the beer cost?
That pudwapper just stepped on my foot. <+++++> Let's kick his ass.
Do I make you horny? <+++++> What?
Absolutely. <+++++> <u>Before</u> 5:00--
Cynthia? <+++++> What?
A crazy madman. <+++++> Use your imagination! First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
Ryan's really angry with me. <+++++> I think he's really angry with me too.
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks. <+++++> Okay, friend.
What about Joe? <+++++> Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana.
 <+++++> What is your point?
But thanks. Hey, Joe, don't get sore about this or anything. You promise? <+++++> Yeah.
My name is Chance. <+++++> Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
I'll walk... <+++++> Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
I can't stop thinking about you. <+++++> Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
Funny, the kind of men women fall for. <+++++> No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
I'm sorry as hell, man. <+++++> Thirty hours. A day of life, plus change...
Yeah, he got a bad attitude. <+++++> You said before, that he got boxes?
He'll never make it. <+++++> That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life. <+++++> Destiny takes a hand.
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure. <+++++> That operation has begun. Are we God, that we would <u>Meddle</u> with it...?
 <+++++> Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
Does Jahn's thing have a name? <+++++> Hey Jahn.....You got a name for this thing?
You know she won't be there. <+++++> It doesn't make any difference where she is.
I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally. <+++++> That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942?
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz. <+++++> You got that right.
C'mon, I might buy a company some day. <+++++> Assets are anything of value a company owns. Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole. By selling them off, I make a profit.
You want to go? <+++++> What do you think?
I'm going to look after you. I'm going to help your brother. I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay? <+++++> He left us! He left us!
What happened? <+++++> You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender. Looked right instead of left.
I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil. <+++++> Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.
Aquittal. <+++++> How?
If you'll just listen to me for a minute -- <+++++> Okay. I'm sorry.
It's good to see you. <+++++> Where to?
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons. <+++++> And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions. <+++++> All I have is my personal feelings. I wasn't raised with the ideals of the Federation. But I'm trying to understand them now.
How long have you worked at the casino? <+++++> Coming up to two years now. But I was away for six months.
Your Uncle John stopped by to visit me. <+++++> Oh really, when?
Did he say "making fuck?" <+++++> Wait, there's more. Olaf: sing...
You? <+++++> Abe Lincoln. Big reach. Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
Any news on Dunbar? <+++++> He's still in the Kommandant's office. That's all I know.
Leave them drums alone. <+++++> Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
Somebody emptied a full clip into him -- <+++++> Stop.
You're going to stay, aren't you? <+++++> That was the general idea.
Hemmingway. Killed himself. I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure. <+++++> 
It looks like they've met in this apartment. <+++++> That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine.
Implanted. <+++++> Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
What is it? What are you? <+++++> There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die. All of us! I saw it!
Rational?! Love is not rational! Are you crazy? <+++++> Yes. I'm crazy. You have driven me crazy.
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill? <+++++> You're my girl, aren't you?
I doubt it, darling. <+++++> Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now? <+++++> You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
She needed it. <+++++> A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
You go first. <+++++> Ladies first. I insist.
A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that. <+++++> What else do you believe in?
 <+++++> Yikes.
Proceed. <+++++> Thank you, Your Honor.
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that? <+++++> My father was a pilot. And do I know how to fly?
...well, most of the time he looks like something the cat might have dragged in, but, you know... <+++++> ...he's smart enough to get you...
What're you doin'? <+++++> I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it. <+++++> Okay.
Fuck him!! ! <+++++> ...Be gone! !
No, not until after they killed him. <+++++> Did you always call him Junior.
Cause if you don't know the number, I can page you with the number so you'll have the number. <+++++> I know the number.
You want the baby to laugh at me. <+++++> Yes.
You've made your point. <+++++> I'm sorry. It's just...
Carousel. <+++++> A carousel - - and a seesaw. They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie. <+++++> How can you be sure?
I'm not. You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense -- <+++++> Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.
I don't know. <+++++> It's not the kind of thing you do.
Dorsia's nice. <+++++> Nice?
It's weird being the groom. All these things Kimmy has to take care of... <+++++> You need a baby-sitter. That's what I'm here for.
I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you. <+++++> Yeah? I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
102  CONTINUED: <+++++> Wait 'til I'm across!
After three years she remembers what the guy drove? <+++++> She remembers because it was her "dream truck." Wanted one just like it.
I've arranged with those people we saw at Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel -- <+++++> No shit.
Hello? <+++++> Hi. Is Frank there?
Thanks for everything, Dad. <+++++> You sure you don't want a ride to work?
Oh, I suck. I suck. <+++++> Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.
Right? Buddy? <+++++> I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
I never learned jazz. <+++++> God, are you always this prosaic?
It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out. <+++++> I know what you want me to do!
My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart. <+++++> Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up. Gould must have been working late. <+++++> I'm certain. He was the biggest defense lawyer around. Infamous, actually.
Surprise, Luther. <+++++> Whaddya want? I thought you were locked up-
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for? <+++++> Twenty eight years ago.
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars. <+++++> And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
Mary-- <+++++> Jabez ...
Are all Jews the same? <+++++> Differences exist, of course, but they're irrelevant. For the Jew, his Jewishness dominates everything.
He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong. <+++++> I belong here. Suppose by some miracle you do get them through. Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
Yes! <+++++> Then who are you?
I have recorded the transmission. <+++++> Play it for us, please.
No one ever tells you that... <+++++> But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
It can't be... <+++++> Give it time. You're like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he feels pain. It will pass. And we must sleep now.
Yes. <+++++> I guess that's where everyone meets him.
 <+++++> Torpedoes coming in -- !
Alfredo, did you know my father? <+++++> Of course I knew your father. He was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. Always smiling.
Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back. <+++++> I can't make it. You go on, master Luke. It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.
Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be... <+++++> Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
Sure she would. <+++++> Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
What are you all, blind? It's a shark. Look -- teeth, jaw, gills. <+++++> Is that what it is?
Don't go upstairs. <+++++> Come with me then.
I know what you're gonna say. You're gonna say it's crazy. <+++++> It's crazy.
What is it, Mary? <+++++> That man -- who is he?
If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was. <+++++> And we twisted it, didn't we, Bert?
Take it or leave it. <+++++> Okay.
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand. <+++++> You're incorrigible!
He's shown himself. Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do? <+++++> Jonas builds assassins for a living. Several of whom may be in place already. We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
He doesn't deserve your loyalty. More important, he's not worth you making threats against us. <+++++> Did I threaten anybody here? I stated a simple fact.
What? <+++++> You lame or something?
I don't know. <+++++> Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril. How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
Sex. <+++++> Could you be more specific?
A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities... <+++++> ...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
 <+++++> Just asking.
Look at this. <+++++> What is it?
That's nice. <+++++> Nice?! He should have been executed!
So did my father and his father before him. <+++++> But it's a responsibility...
Why did you come in here? <+++++> I don't know. I wanted to help you. And now that I'm here, I don't know how.
Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach! <+++++> That's the boardwalk, Sam.
You're in gun country now, my friend. <+++++> Been to the Boat Show.
Harry, I just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker-- <+++++> --so?
...Anyway, we got some time now. But we gotta be smart. <+++++> Ray--
Why? <+++++> I don't know. I can't be alone.
No, I'm paying for the dress. Do you think she's still gonna run? <+++++> I don't know.
Can I help? <+++++> Oh. Hi. I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
Her doctors killed her. <+++++> I'm sorry...?
So what happened? <+++++> Life knocked me back.
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something. <+++++> Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering.
What are you talking about? Vegas? <+++++> VEGAS.
I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped. <+++++> But they don't have a case against you.
No thank you. <+++++> You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States.
Everything you cook is good. <+++++> Duff - you know those women you used to know--
You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me. <+++++> I'm not so sure you do.
They've all made their money from the war -- mostly from crooked war contracts. They say Citizen Barras has put away millions. <+++++> I see...
I'm afraid not. <+++++> That's too bad.
Could you tell me where you were last night? <+++++> Here. I played Gregory Lutz.
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake -- <+++++> He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
What time did Matt Brown get in? <+++++> Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until afterÂ
No. I went back to the hotel. And waited. <+++++> Ten years later, here you are again.
Hello. Kay? <+++++> How is your father?
Like songs? <+++++> Yeah, they could be songs.
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone? <+++++> Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight...
You didn't just smash up the bathroom? <+++++> No.
Sure. <+++++> It's right this way.
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him? <+++++> Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
Do we know what this says? <+++++> Yup... The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
What... what are these interviews about? <+++++> The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
You've done me a great service. <+++++> It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan! <+++++> Well, you hire illegals--
You're crazy! That's not true. <+++++> Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name... <+++++> A lovestruck page!
Desmond. <+++++> New to the country, kid?
What do you mean? <+++++> You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
I'm firing you. Action's taken. Confidence restored. Stock goes up. I sell my shares. <+++++> There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
Where? I don't see a thing. <+++++> Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
Eight o'clock? <+++++> I was just going to say "eight." You're fantastic!
Don't get up. And don't act as if I were the queen mother. <+++++> I don't expect you to be pleasant.
And your passport? <+++++> Yes, don't worry.
Try some deep breathing. <+++++> What?
He's got diabetes. He's not a well person. <+++++> Those bastards -- they poisoned the pizza! Sal - you didn't eat any pizza! ?
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know? <+++++> Huh?
A new car. We can't afford a new car. <+++++> Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
Who did? <+++++> I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had.
For my hair? <+++++> Yes, for your hair.
The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross. All the heavenly angels must envy your grace. <+++++> I like well your conceit, Jack. Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
How do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect? <+++++> Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
337.....I'm sorry.... <+++++> It's ok, take your time.
My what? <+++++> You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
Are you taking them still? <+++++> No, but I count them. In a sock isn't new, you know?
Oh, let me go and have a bit of peril? <+++++> No. It's unhealthy.
He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."' <+++++> Will. Get right back here. He just called.
Twenty grand. And of course I still keep the rug. <+++++> Just for making the hand-off?
I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively. <+++++> I lost my husband four years ago, you know.
Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like. <+++++> Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
What? <+++++> Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
I'm telling you, I was there. <+++++> You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
Come now, Mr. Chance. <+++++> I have no claim, Thomas.
No. I must deactivate you. <+++++> For how long?
Give me the short version. <+++++> Six shots at less than ten feet. Weapon was a large caliber--
Oh no, no, no, no, no. It can't be. How embarrassing. <+++++> You're a very good boy to respond that way.
She doesn't seem to understand. <+++++> Try another language.
But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh? <+++++> OK. I'll think about it.
I told you you could write, Josie Geller. <+++++> I finally found my story.
Well, she went somewhere! She didn't just up and disappear into thin air! <+++++> No...not air --
So, you got a name by the way? <+++++> Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there? <+++++> I doubt it. How did you find out?
Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take. <+++++> I have to go to New York tomorrow.
I aim to. <+++++> Well--tell the folks inside how it is, Tom. Tell 'em they're starvin' us and stabbin' theirself in the back.
I say NO! <+++++> 
You promise? <+++++> Cross my heart.
You know what Sanford told me? <+++++> I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
You're positive of that, aren't you? <+++++> Absolutely sure.
Oooohhhh. <+++++> Don't wake the kids...
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while. <+++++> I should have -
Sure. <+++++> ...fuck is this? Fuck!
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me. <+++++> What?
I can't relax. <+++++> Wiggle your toes.
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live? <+++++> Four years.
Hitch-hiking. <+++++> Well, you've given me a very good example of the hikingÂ
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well-- <+++++> Have I?
No. It's new and clean, and waiting. <+++++> What else?
Since when? <+++++> Probably since she was born.
I feel the same, sir. <+++++> I will continue with our French allies, concentrating on New York.
That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like. <+++++> Will you quit gabbin' and do what you're told.
OK. Say what it is. <+++++> The Ambassador will receive instructions for the drop, half an hour before it is to be made. If it is successful, there will be more.
The sign of our partnership. <+++++> Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
How do you do? <+++++> One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
Does she suffer? Does she know what she is? <+++++> I don't know. I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question. He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
How'd you do? <+++++> Piece of cake. She'll be there.
Hale-what? <+++++> You'll love it. No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
How ya doing, honey? <+++++> Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
Thank you. <+++++> Anything for a fellow pilgrim. Sometimes we need help getting where we want to be.
We're all square now, Harry. Right? <+++++> All square, Doc.
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him! Oh George, you must take me with you! <+++++> Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
The goddamned bastards. <+++++> Tell me about it.
Fine. I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you. <+++++> Fuck off.
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist? <+++++> I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill.
He wants us to recognize <u>his</u> hand. I've seen this hand before... what are you hiding? <+++++> Nothing.
Oh my God. <+++++> Pardon?
Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here. <+++++> Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it. <+++++> Of course they will. You just have to be patient. I'm betting on you.
Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist. <+++++> Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
Bonjour. <+++++> Good morning.
 <+++++> I don't even know this woman.
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart. <+++++> Oh God. What hospital?
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him. <+++++> Maybe. I think he's got a few things to learn about our people.
There's only one way to be positive. I need to see some droppings. I have to see the dinosaur's droppings. <+++++> You won't be able to miss them. Can't miss them.
It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd. <+++++> How many employees?
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character. <+++++> May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
What do you do for heat in this barrack? No stove? <+++++> The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
Computer device? <+++++> Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something.
I'm going to fill it right now. <+++++> Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love? <+++++> I got no idea of love. And neither have you.
Every day? <+++++> Turn around!
The Grand Hotel. <+++++> Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
What? <+++++> I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row.
The two surfer boys? <+++++> Affirmative.
Where's Jake? <+++++> McKendrick's men got him.
Carla was in the car, right? <+++++> I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
What's next Walt ? <+++++> A dragon.
Well did you or didn't you? <+++++> Yes! They'll be in soon.
Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne. <+++++> Maybe you can, Libby.
He'd love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it? "To enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests"? <+++++> You crashed my file?
Stop it! <+++++> Wendy give me the bat.
I know it begins with a "C"... <+++++> Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink? Two bourbons.
Why? <+++++> This whole place can't be wired to just one circuit --
Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing. Anacott Steel. <+++++> No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something?
This is the Feur thing? <+++++> Yes. And he's going to get away with it.
What do you think, Brother? <+++++> I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
I'm a director now! I made "Glen Or Glenda." Directing <u>is</u> my day job. <+++++> All I know is, ever since "Glen Or Glenda," all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes!
How'd he die? <+++++> Broke his neck.
That's the rumor. <+++++> You retired, too?
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain. <+++++> What of it?
He musta changed ! I got to get into the Nung River, here or here. <+++++> That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy.
No. <+++++> Thanks.
We got to get movin'. <+++++> What for?
Valentin Zukovsky. <+++++> BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all. <+++++> Anybody talk to the press?
Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it? <+++++> Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again. <+++++> No, that's fine. It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.
Good seeing you again. <+++++> Whish the circumstances were different.
How's it going? <+++++> Great. We got one of 'em.
My father. <+++++> All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
Yeh, but I don't know where he is. <+++++> Well we do. He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
Why come to me? <+++++> Because you're my sister. There's nobody else. The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it. <+++++> No fear of that now.
This sucks. It's all hot and stuff. <+++++> This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
She was good in bed, though. <+++++> Go to sleep.
...Did you really say that? <+++++> Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
Sure. Too much birthday cake, right? <+++++> I guess...
Not really. Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress? <+++++> I don't know. I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
How ya doin'? <+++++> Uh, hi.
Well, uh... <+++++> Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
You're her Savior? Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building? <+++++> You know what I'm saying here.
What's the scene... <+++++> It used to be the Old Mill.
No, ma'am. <+++++> Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
You could put it that way. <+++++> But that's so fuckin' stupid. I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
They said they wouldn't hurt them, wouldn't hurt them if... <+++++> They lied.
If we're for real? <+++++> You don't exactly look like drug dealers.
Is that her real name? <+++++> Just a little nickname. Yep, they're my kids and they're all I need.
I'm sorry. Slip of the tongue. <+++++> Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home. <+++++> You want me to help you get out of the country?
This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts! <+++++> Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was. <+++++> There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter. <+++++> Did she believe you?
I said I got his machine. <+++++> No, what did you say on the machine?
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify? Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty? <+++++> Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
Akta dedero ansila do mektet. <+++++> I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I? <+++++> Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out.
Well - I meanÂ <+++++> What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust. <+++++> Of course I'll help -- I told you I would, didn't I? Come on now --
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry? <+++++> Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K. <+++++> Shut up. Cupcake. Please. Inside.
The door was already open... <+++++> We know... Send the book to evidence...
Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy. <+++++> Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break. <+++++> Get going.
I don't think your mother would like that. <+++++> Just a little one.
I'm switching off now. <+++++> Virgil, you wiener! You never could stand up to fight. You--
...ven't you? <+++++> You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services -
It's not going to be very comfortable. <+++++> I'll be fine.
Oh Man, not the sewer, I just had this cape cleaned... <+++++> It's okay. Let her go.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married. <+++++> How do you know?
No, Mrs. Lampert. <+++++> But no one actually saw him die.
Hey, Ace. <+++++> Hey.
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are. <+++++> Then why isn't there anyone around?
How 'bout you? <+++++> Don't know if I'll still want it.
I'm sorry, but I just wondered -- <+++++> Excuse me, I have to copy this for Central Docketing by 2:30.
She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips. <+++++> What happened?
Yes. 53 <+++++> Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over? You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.
HUMMMM..... <+++++> What happened?
Then... <+++++> Look, you guys know how it is.
Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it. <+++++> You already pitched this to Rigfort? !
Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it-- <+++++> My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow. <+++++> Always.
Show me the other one again. I like them both. <+++++> I'll take them both.
I photographed it extensively, father. <+++++> Photography teaches you nothing, Ann! Click! One second and you've seen all you're going to see.
You bastard! I need a lawyer immediately! <+++++> What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
It's possible. <+++++> Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you. <+++++> He says he loves me.
I mean, what do you want? What are you doing hanging around here. <+++++> I need you to teach me.
Not in front of the boy. <+++++> Very well.
Why not, lad? Absolute justice? <+++++> Something like that.
To failure! <+++++> To failure!
A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future -- <+++++> I myself --
Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay. <+++++> Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ... Had to get home early.
But...who... <+++++> Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend everything's normal. I'm Salvatore.
So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me. <+++++> Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
Maybe it's not the army, Jake. <+++++> What do you mean?
I have a message for you from your "niece", sir. <+++++> My what?
You don't expect me to do that do you? <+++++> Yes. When I tell you.
Baker. Jack Baker. <+++++> Right. Bring him back.
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? -- <+++++> -- Stephen, this is bullshit --
That's a new one. Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford? <+++++> That's what I know.
I thought all witches were benign and good. <+++++> Not this one.
What is it? <+++++> You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
What club? <+++++> Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her. <+++++> Not because of me, I hope.
When was the last time you had a girlfriend? <+++++> Where you married?
Answer the question! <+++++> You fuck me, then snub me. You love me, you hate me.
Not a lot, sweetie. It's a country. Like Canada. Only smaller. <+++++> Where are you, anyway?
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you. <+++++> I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
Shut up! <+++++> What are you going to do, get married? Have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats! And go around scrubbing the --
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months. <+++++> I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
What do you do when you come here? <+++++> I sit. I think. I play games.
Do what you've worked your whole life to do? <+++++> It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
No! <+++++> That's an order!
Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda .. <+++++> Since when did you drink diet soda?
I believe in you. You just have to get back on the court. Like you'd get back on a horse. <+++++> A horse?
Can we trust him? <+++++> No... but what choice have we?
What happened to you? <+++++> I'm...  being...  punished.
How? <+++++> Get Steve back his job...please...
Mr. Bangs. <+++++> Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.
Who's that, Ted? <+++++> Sammy Davis Junior. Terrible car accident. He hasn't been the same since.
It seems like my Susan, but... <+++++> When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
Not me. You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement. <+++++> Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?
How about five hundred. <+++++> What? !
So who are you? <+++++> The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago. <+++++> I don't know either. I think I'm a very nice guy. I also think I'm a pretty smart guy in my own way.
What happened to your hand? <+++++> I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
After fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down. You can deal with anything. <+++++> Have you finished those reports?
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might. <+++++> Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
Dad -- what you doing here? <+++++> It so happens I work here, and there's an unsolved murder.
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now. <+++++> I said I would get you to your ship and that's where we're going to say goodbye.
You ever seen this motherfucker before? <+++++> Who, Mr. White?
What do they want? <+++++> I don't know. Rob us. I don't know.
You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time. <+++++> No, please.
I need Il Duce. <+++++> The Duke? What did you do?
None of your business. <+++++> Things 're lookin' up on the docks, huh, Jackie?
Are you alright? <+++++> What? What's wrong? What is it?
Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells? <+++++> I can't believe you people! No wonder she never comes to these things!
Enough. It's better. Please, Lambchop, it's better. Stop. You're hurting it again. <+++++> How do you do. I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
So... We must free more Canadian prizoners? <+++++> Yeah, I guess.
I guess by the bed. <+++++> It's twenty of three.

The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up. <+++++> I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour. Magicians get burned. <+++++> Or murdered, like Nix.

Where's that? <+++++> Off a little alley with cobblestones. Hemingway went there...
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody? <+++++> Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was. <+++++> What he was, was a hack, couldn't get a job writing for anybody but you. I'm being honest.
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian. <+++++> I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name?

Hmmm. Do you miss me? <+++++> Oddly enough, I do.
Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44. It's Son of Sam. Is it Son of Sam? <+++++> Look in the crowd. He liked to hang around and watch the cops at work...

You in trouble? <+++++> Yeah.

Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization? <+++++> I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.

Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived. And the second greatest predator must take him down. <+++++> But why?
How many? <+++++> Dante...

Aunt Lily? <+++++> Bingo.
You can' t imagine them, Jean Luc. They're kids! All with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant. <+++++> Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...

Why? <+++++> ...because if you don't, they die...
He's not slowing. <+++++> He's going to slow down.

We'll talk some other time. <+++++> Great... That's great.
I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not... <+++++> Stop...

You must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this. <+++++> Yes, I am, sir.
Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away? <+++++> It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.
So what do we do ? <+++++> I'm working on it.
Is the program ready? <+++++> No, Brother Minister.
We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em? <+++++> Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.

Oh, no. <+++++> Well, who are you, then?
What do you mean "complete"? <+++++> I wish I could tell you. I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here. I'll notify the CDC and --
What is that? <+++++> This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh. How... ? Whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow....
Look at that. Get a gander. <+++++> Oh my!
You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles? <+++++> Yes.
That was fun. I don't think California is bad at all. It's a drag coming home. <+++++> Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
Did you tell Alice? <+++++> No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection.
This is wrong...it's like we cheated... <+++++> I know... But Dad, you can't go back. You didn't die in that fire.

You think about your father a lot, don't you? <+++++> Yes mam...
I'll send your regrets. Honestly, why must I even bother? <+++++> Because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.

Why? <+++++> What?

I think I've got something to say. <+++++> Very well ...
The oak where Jocelyn sprained her ankle. <+++++> Exactly. When we get into the clearing, I'll turn on my sexy moves. Wichita will go for it or he'll shoot me down.

Mr. Kramer, do you ever have sex in here with anyone? <+++++> Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social life discreetly. At the moment I am seeing no one.
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid. <+++++> I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
Who? <+++++> Kurtzweil, we think.
Naturally enough, your understudy. <+++++> I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
I have no idea. <+++++> You think Lorenson kills you?
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself. <+++++> Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
Up to six weeks, I think. <+++++> How are we going to cope?

Hey, Lawrence how are you doing mate? <+++++> Doug, haven't seen you for a while.

Yes, I remember. What do you do when these moods overtake you? <+++++> Nothing. I mean, nothing.
Why, Terry, who said it was? <+++++> Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.
The woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol, and some of his clothes. <+++++> So the woman's married. She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it.
You're leaving? <+++++> Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
For a blur? <+++++> There is something <u>there</u>--don't ask, just trust me.
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch. <+++++> I wanna live with them too.
Get the bang sticks. We're going down. <+++++> Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? -- <+++++> -- not yet --
MOTHERFUCKER! ! <+++++> COCKSUCKER!
If I don't move, I can't shoot it. <+++++> Let it go, Peter. The animal won.
Look, mister... <+++++> Take a look, Harold. Tell me if you see anything you want. You do like to look, don't you?
Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years. <+++++> You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter. <+++++> I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
Not the guards. Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed. <+++++> You have to tell me who did it.
Wait, wait... <+++++> For what?
That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage. <+++++> I'll bet it's been done.
About three years. <+++++> No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!! ?
Huh? <+++++> He had a feeling you'd be coming by.
All of them! Just lies! <+++++> Colon! Don't!
 <+++++> Really?
Your health... <+++++> Ta ss'trakyona'...
George. <+++++> Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
You sound like that all the time. <+++++> Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
Yeah. <+++++> Fine.
:Would you stop it! <+++++> :Well, they are.
What's this about a new way? There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, and no error. Let me hear more. <+++++> Well, we go round shop crasting and the like, coming out with a pitiful rookerful of money each.
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole. <+++++> Where?
You must be going somewhere. <+++++> I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
Yeah. Pretty sure. Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too. <+++++> God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
Are you wearing a uniform? <+++++> No.
If you reach for the stars, you're bound to get -- mm-Jack, pull over. <+++++> Huh? Oh Jesus...
And I...I've got other things happening. <+++++> I'm sure we can match any offer.
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear. <+++++> Please, don't tell me those things... Not now. This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
But I'm married. <+++++> Something else we have in common.
...not that time... <+++++> So when are you comin' to pick us up?
Boss, are you calling the President a murderer? <+++++> If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices? Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?
 <+++++> 
Hey, play that demo again, man. Alright. <+++++> Oh, man. Wow. I was never into football, you know?
No fucking. <+++++> No.
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things? <+++++> At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college. I can't afford to lose my job.
Got a couple of kids, huh? <+++++> Yeah. Just babies.
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper. <+++++> Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
That bad? Old or young? <+++++> Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris.
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife. <+++++> I'd like to do that.
He could hardly help suspecting you. <+++++> That's putting it mildly.
No. <+++++> A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
So many children. Are they all orphans? <+++++> Well, this *is* an orphanage.
Perhaps he's visiting a guest. <+++++> No, I figure he stays here. Where's your registration?
I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done... <+++++> In other words, you want to get laid?
If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy. <+++++> Louis, are you sure?
Michael, Rowan should - <+++++> NO! she's pregnant, Aaron. she's got that to deal with - and the clinic.. she is not to hear about this.
I'll come back all the time. <+++++> Of course you will.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there. <+++++> This is not my usual Friday night!
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor. <+++++> If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.
Coming to bed? <+++++> Few minutes. Want to catch the news.
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing? <+++++> C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
We haven't got a lead... <+++++> Why not?
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you. <+++++> What would you like to know, sir?
The greatest yarn ever written by anybody. My hat's off to you, Hildy! <+++++> Thanks.
I don't know. <+++++> But you want to.
Now what? <+++++> Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff? <+++++> Well, yes...
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private. <+++++> You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
No we didn't. He died on his own. <+++++> Oh, right, with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl.
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive. <+++++> Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care, it's none of my business... But I want to see Mary.
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off. <+++++> Get out.
Yes. You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing... <+++++> Anchor?
Look! There it is! <+++++> What? Who?
She left the fucking gate open. <+++++> Well he can't have gone far.
Did he raise the Kids? <+++++> Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
What do you want us to do? <+++++> Die.
I'm with you, Brother Minister. <+++++> No. You'll be marked for death.
Big talk. <+++++> Just keep it up.
Can't say. <+++++> Then who's the Banker?
You got no case, John. <+++++> If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..
Not the way youÂre thinking. The women wanted me there for support. You can understand that. <+++++> I think thatÂs disgusting.
Warm. <+++++> Is it?
No? <+++++> Do you have any idea what my life is like?
Who are you? What is your name? <+++++> I don't know, [I tell you].
Try it again. <+++++> ItÃ­s not working.
You're from the reservation. It's a different world. <+++++> I'm from Minneapolis. Fifth Street. I did four years at Dartmouth before I ever set foot on this res.
... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway? <+++++> Yes. 1988. He was furious at the British plan to return Hong Kong, and supposedly started his own negotiations with the Chinese Government.
That's what it's about. <+++++> Being patient. Don't rush things. I get it.
Okay. <+++++> Come on... let's find you something to wear.
But you took his orders. He was directing the autopsy. <+++++> No, because there were others. There were admirals.
Murdered? Why? <+++++> There was this case. A serial. He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69. The papers called them the Nightingale Murders.
I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow. <+++++> Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work.
How you going to get there? You can't trust the spooks to pull you out. They'll use you up and throw you away. <+++++> I know. I go with you.
Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ... <+++++> Then tell Richardson to fire him.
I can accept that, it comes with the job. <+++++> Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.
I... I hate the way he <u>behaves</u>... he's selfish and self-centered and cynical... <+++++> What's "cynical"?
These are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name. Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable. <+++++> They're pretty. Can I have them?
He's gone. He stole the car. <+++++> Where was it parked?
Newberry, get a photo. South? <+++++> Entering my scan now...
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother? <+++++> Tell her I feel fine...
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there. <+++++> Thank you. "Now hear this: Drop dead."
That is amazing. What year is it? <+++++> George?
Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here. <+++++> Not us, I hope.
They're from different cultures and different races. That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did. The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous. <+++++> How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid? It's dead.
I'll take some. <+++++> Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it? <+++++> Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.
We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace. <+++++> We have.
What does he do? <+++++> 
You don't know? <+++++> That's why I'm asking.
What? <+++++> What's that?
Where are you going? <+++++> To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie. <+++++> Is she sleeping or...?
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot. <+++++> What are you talking about?
At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands. <+++++> You killed Santa Claus?
No matter what it did to our marriage -- ? <+++++> My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
You're the number one man. Have a swell party.' <+++++> I have no idea what you're talking about.
So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away. <+++++> With RamÃ³n it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
So do I! <+++++> But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
It's none of your business! <+++++> Where's Catherine? !
Sure. Twinkie? <+++++> I'm chewing.
I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable. <+++++> Yo, I'm not comfortable either.
So what happened ? <+++++> He was working A.R.V.N.
So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours. <+++++> And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
Struck out eighteen... <+++++> League record.
Tuesday. I had a late lunch. <+++++> Did you see a message to call me when you got back in?
Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best. <+++++> You said you could help.
Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only -- <+++++> Don't worry about it. If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
You sound bitter. <+++++> Why should I be bitter? Boxing's been good to me.
We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role. <+++++> Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
Can your man handle that? <+++++> I think so. I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
I didn't build the fucking thing. <+++++> Okay. Okay. But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
What? <+++++> You have, I believe, some minimal background in music. Therefore, you are to join our choir.
What do you want to do? <+++++> Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
Got your license? <+++++> Yes.
I've never done this before. <+++++> Oh? It's easy. You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl.
Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis. <+++++> Well today it was Otis. And you should keep him away from our yard. Because Sheila will defend herself.
You have only to stretch out your hand, take up the glass and drink a little. <+++++> It won't hurt.
I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again. <+++++> Good strategy.
You okay? <+++++> I... yeah, I'm okay. I'm fine.
Think it'll work? <+++++> Nah.
We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out. <+++++> ...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that. <+++++> I'll never love anybody else.
What's that tune that you're playing <+++++> Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
But <u>I'm</u> the messenger. An error like this damages my credibility. <+++++> Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz	can still dance. <+++++> Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
Come on. <+++++> Well, except for one thing.
30 hours to Neptune orbit. <+++++> All boards are green, everything's five by five.
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures. <+++++> Let me explain something to you, Walsh. This business requires a certain finesse.
Maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you. <+++++> No.
Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer... <+++++> So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
While Sam and I take out the back two cars... <+++++> Leaving...
Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town. <+++++> Oh, it's all right, beats Jew York. But the niggers have took it over, just like every other city we got, only worse.
Why'd you do it, Armitage? <+++++> The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
But why, Gray? Why? <+++++> Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much <+++++> Sorry, sorry...
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one. <+++++> She took you shopping for a tie?
No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are. <+++++> Then how did you catch me, Will?
What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby? <+++++> Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss.
What's the matter? You gotta get back to Shaw? <+++++> Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar. Can't see him till morning anyway.
I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out. <+++++> Why?
The second R is silent. <+++++> Oh, of course.
Shit, thank God. You look like a creep. <+++++> Thanks.
Hi. <+++++> Hello.
Not a boast, sir, but a curse. Never have I met my match in joust or duel. <+++++> Move aside!
WhereÂs my real dad? <+++++> I donÂt know...
You don't think he'd beÂ helpful? <+++++> Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.
Shut up, it's all right. Do you want a drink? <+++++> No, thanks.
What are these? <+++++> Mostly caffeine diuretics. Help you go to the bathroom.
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there. <+++++> Madam Grusinskaya's car.
Well, I'll just make it for you. <+++++> Okay.
Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship? <+++++> Even logic must give way to physics. Gravity hadn't been restored by the time they escaped.
Beautiful! <+++++> What was?
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man! <+++++> It is, I'm telling you it is! !
What have you set your mind to? <+++++> Being a good Muslim, a good nurse and a good wife.
...might I make a suggestion...? <+++++> ...after you' re dead. AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD, do you understand...when I give the <u>word</u>...
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person. <+++++> Debbie Klein cried a lot.
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon. <+++++> When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
How you doing? <+++++> I'm fine. Kind of tired.
What are my choices? <+++++> About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
How's the trailer? <+++++> Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.
This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me. <+++++> Uh-huh.
Thank goodness, my needs are small...As  it turns out, I have this affinity for beachfront property . . . <+++++> What do you want?
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do? <+++++> Just trying to get to my boat...
I don't know. I don't know who I am. <+++++> Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
I wonder sometimes. <+++++> You're just scared.
Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us? <+++++> Doesn't matter. We know where they're going. C'mon.
Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me. I'd like to have a baby myself. Wouldn't you? <+++++> Tonight?
Spit it out. <+++++> It's going to be flawless. People will barely be able to comprehend it.
Give what up? <+++++> Why do people have to love people, anyway?
I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time. I've got to take a leak. <+++++> Right, Chief.
Are you ready now? <+++++> Yes. Say goodbye, Toto.
You're not my mother!! ! <+++++> Don't listen.
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes. <+++++> Dixie McCoy didn't.
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been. <+++++> Oh.
Who was this partner of his? <+++++> A Southern gentlemen. I don't recall his name.
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department. <+++++> Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale. <+++++> Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
Comrades! Good people of France! <+++++> Now, Ninotchka... please!
IÂm sure IÂll find a way. <+++++> Like youÂll find a way to stop your Austrian killing you a second time round?
There always are. But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically. A few loose ends don't matter. <+++++> Something's wrong. I feel it inside. Doesn't that sound crazy?
I've missed you. <+++++> Are you okay?
Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz. <+++++> All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me.
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales... <+++++> I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
A thousand. You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face. <+++++> We must sue for peace.
Six years ago. What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon? <+++++> None of your damn business.
Well I guess it doesn't. <+++++> Does you mother still work?
Wait. <+++++> Wait.
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain. <+++++> Are you?
Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco. Please proceed. <+++++> We have the codes here. How do you want to receive them?
Darling Susan. <+++++> You're so famous now.
nothing. <+++++> I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother. <+++++> And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon. <+++++> 
Rise, Mordred. <+++++> I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
Oh yeah? Whatta you drink, then? <+++++> I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness.
And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off. <+++++> Yeah.
How about you? <+++++> Oh. Well, I live--
You're twenty minutes late. <+++++> Sorry.
The British! These men cannot stand against them! <+++++> What do you know about these men!? They can stand against anything! They've seen more war than most field generals!
Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel. <+++++> All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
Yes. <+++++> Say them.
He used that? <+++++> Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
Makes me sick. <+++++> What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off.
I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic. <+++++> Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood. <+++++> You know how he is. He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied. It blows over.
Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us. <+++++> I'm gonna pray that I never need to call you.
An artist of your caliber... <+++++> I'm only trying to...
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline. <+++++> I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money. <+++++> Chris!
Excuse me? <+++++> She hated my voice. Said it drove her crazy.
And by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization. <+++++> Yes, sir. But what about the disks? If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say. <+++++> Honey, I'm not, please...
Corleone. <+++++> There is nothing there. Not anymore.
Quite simple. Yes. Good. <+++++> I shall send a letter to America, to the President, informing him of our problem.
The sawbones? <+++++> Yep.
And so Missoula's prodigal son returns. <+++++> INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY.
Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh? <+++++> Yeah... I'll write a song. Ha, ha. I don't know. Life is funny!
What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday. Why you don't belong in this business. <+++++> Why I don't...
Hey! <+++++> Come on. We don't have much time.
...What's your pleasure, buddy? <+++++> Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it. <+++++> Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
Jake, why don't you just try lying down and get some rest. <+++++> I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out.
What? <+++++> I said I'll drop it.
Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit? <+++++> Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this. <+++++> You said that once already... Too late now.
So what do we do now? <+++++> I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo? <+++++> I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Twenty minutes? <+++++> You heard me. You. Congress and cabinet heads.
I haven't seen him in two years. <+++++> But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are. <+++++> You know, even when I think about your face I get happier.
What would he think? <+++++> Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool.
You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours. <+++++> Maybe he did.
Now, General, I'm going to sandbag you. Do you think we're ready to get out of this belly? <+++++> Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.
You never thought of the possibility? <+++++> Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . . Look at me!
Yes. <+++++> And do you know why?
How do you do, Miss Daniels? Acknowledge a what? <+++++> A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
What do you mean? <+++++> This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we? <+++++> You're right, sir.
Rafe -- <+++++> I need to tell you something. I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you.
What's in it? <+++++> I think Tom Grunemann's dead. I've been a lot of places - I've asked a lot of people.
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal? <+++++> Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
I'm sorry. <+++++> Why, you <u>whore</u>!
Maybe you outta lay off a little... <+++++> Gordo, I wasn't dreaming. I talked to him, it was real.
Charles! What's up, man? <+++++> Oh. You know.
We still going? <+++++> Honda 250, huh?
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it? <+++++> I couldn't help myself. You get lost inside a women like her. It was like a drug. It was the best sex I ever had.
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl? ! <+++++> Why would you get bent if I asked?
I didn't mean it that way -- I was just talking to him on the phone -- he's very concerned about you. <+++++> He doesn't give a damn about me.
Why do they do that? <+++++> Do what?
Well, you must know. You were brought up Libya, yes? <+++++> Don't cut me.
Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be. <+++++> I have kept it.
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we? <+++++> No.
He's moved on to TV. <+++++> He always had a weakness in that area. I saw it the first time I met him. We all had our weaknesses, I guess.
Yeah, it does. <+++++> But you never can tell. Why don't you get that new rifle out of the wagon?
We can't survive this, sir. They also have you instructing Dean to make the payoff to Hunt. <+++++> There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain.
How? <+++++> By her own hand. There are many such stories.
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again. <+++++> Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time...
Thank you, Floris. <+++++> Think, Jew florist?
THREE SECONDS! ! <+++++> LET'S DO IT! ?
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt. <+++++> Could you give us a moment.
I'm scared. What is it? <+++++> It's in a cage. Do not be scared of...
Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open. What's the range of this thing? <+++++> It's hard to tell. I'm gonna have to be close.
Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss... <+++++> What I think is going on with your son.
One chance here, Eduardo. Make us believe you got a boss. No boss, it's all on you. <+++++> It's a death sentence. I'll never make it to the trial.
Thanks. <+++++> Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
You have no conception of this, do you? <+++++> You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this.
Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to... <+++++> I don't know.
Ah, coffee. Smells good. <+++++> One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
Where are we? <+++++> Someplace safe. How you feeling?
Son, with the exception of Spring Break in Tijuana, have you ever ventured outside of California? <+++++> Many times.
I was hoping I'd get to meet you. <+++++> You mean, you knew about me?
You see what I see, Bork? <+++++> I see it. I don't get it.
Do you know that jungle? <+++++> When I was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt.
I can try. <+++++> You'd have to try real hard. No one's used currency in over ten years. What are you, from another planet?
What about tomorrow? <+++++> We don't need you, Frankie.
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean. <+++++> Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
Got a smoke? <+++++> You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation.
Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you. <+++++> Why haven't you turned us in?
Who will? <+++++> Security.
Best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass-- <+++++> --and The ass of The man who adores her.
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list. <+++++> Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.
Had to've done it. No one else was in there. <+++++> How you know that?
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am. <+++++> Go ahead--Bert says take it.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall. <+++++> I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me.
I didn't know you took pictures. <+++++> I guess you could call it a hobby.
Surprise. WeÂre pregnant...  Yeah...that mustÂve been...I mean that was very unexpected. But what are you gonna do, right? <+++++> I think it worked out okay, donÂt you?
Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place? <+++++> I think you must be mistaken, sir.
What's the matter?! You mad at me? <+++++> No. Why?
Who's he? <+++++> Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you? <+++++> Nothing.
The jury saw it differently. <+++++> So this is the guy you're going to hang?
It happens to this piece of shit... <+++++> ...all the time.
Who's there! <+++++> Buzz Fazeli.
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right? <+++++> Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
Is that right? What are the trees saying today? <+++++> They're sayin' that nobody's gonna talk to you cuz they don't give away one of their own.
Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him. <+++++> Don't let it trouble you. He's an old man and these last few days have been a terrible strain on him.
Why did you come to ... my province. <+++++> We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.
What's with your friend there? <+++++> She's... sick. Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
No. <+++++> Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that.
No ...  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave. <+++++> ... and you'll come and get him.
Hell! <+++++> What is it?
You keep the sixty-four cents. I want you to have it. <+++++> It's sticky. What you do, slobber on 'em? I wouldn't touch 'em.
Bill... <+++++> Huh?
What for? I can say anything I want with my eyes. <+++++> It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
They were ... <+++++> You tryin' to fuck me?
Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route. <+++++> All I want to know is the where and the when. Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.
No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint. <+++++> Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
An' all my meals for free... <+++++> What about you, Delmar? What're you gonna do with your share a that dough?
No, sir. <+++++> My I.D. cards.
I shut it off. What's her royal holiness want? <+++++> She is looking for Master Luke, and assumed he would be here with you. No one seems to know ...
Hasan? <+++++> Riddick?
Hello, Mr. Gardiner. This is Sid Courtney, Washington Post. <+++++> Hello, Sid.
Don't get carried away. <+++++> Uh oh --
You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out? <+++++> If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately. <+++++> But from now on it's Lucky's spot.
My husband's out looking for him. <+++++> He run away often?
...excuse me. <+++++> Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing! <+++++> You're doing fine. I won't let anything happen to you, remember?
Lesson number two. Never work for your former spouse. <+++++> That's not nothing to do with it. You cooked this story up and you know it.
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir? <+++++> Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.
The two of us getting married someday. Having kids. Stupid stuff. <+++++> What happened to him?
Muncy! Engines to half! <+++++> Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
Me? <+++++> Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
What time is it? <+++++> When you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two. It is now five forty-three. When you ask a minute from no, it will be-
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night? <+++++> I gotta get to English class.
They skipped that step. <+++++> I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
Either one will be fine. <+++++> Okay.
What should I have told you? <+++++> Why wasn't I involved from the beginning? You and I started fight club together.
Yeah, well, what's your religion? <+++++> 
He was disoriented in transport, Tron. <+++++> Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP
Did you find a sword? An old sword? <+++++> Yeah -- how'd you know that?
Good. <+++++> You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock. <+++++> A distinct possibility.
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one... <+++++> When was the last time you talked to your son?
What party? <+++++> The birthday party.
A full and thorough investigation ... We've cooperated with the FBI, we'll cooperate with the Senate. What do we have to hide? <+++++> No, we have nothing to hide.
Good morning, Cheeba. <+++++> Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
I'll tell her but she won't take it. <+++++> Then she's not as smart as I thought she was. You've seen her in the depositions. Tell me you don't have any doubts?
I need another one, sir. <+++++> Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
You disappointed? <+++++> Funny Jimmy. You're so clean and you--this is silly.
Your mom. <+++++> Daddy, what if The Face comes when I'm at mommy's?
Oh, Sallah! What a relief! <+++++> Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
I do. You seek the Holy Grail. <+++++> That is our quest. You know much that is hidden O Tim.
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway. You get it? <+++++> No.
Should be one-thirty. <+++++> I got an audition, I won't make it here 'till two, c'mon, I'll see you later. Love you.
Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with. <+++++> I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
Why don't you start with me? <+++++> You're not them.
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook. <+++++> Fourteen thousand marks... One can travel -- one's happiness might depend on fourteen thousand marks -- don't you think so, Baron?
Ma'am. <+++++> You are here safely.
We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her. <+++++> I'll do my best.
Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you? <+++++> Yes sir.
Why not? <+++++> I asked for a policeman.
Naw. I'll take the zero. <+++++> You feel good, not nervous?
You're scarin' me, baby. <+++++> Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it...
Why does it all mean so much to you? All the time, 'land, land, land.' <+++++> My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land!
Now, why in the hell would you assume that? <+++++> I don't know. Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer -- <+++++> No lawyers, Drew. We're going to offer you a deal.
Greer? <+++++> I don't know. No. Not Greer. Somebody.
We don't have time for hysterics. <+++++> We don't?
What are they? <+++++> It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
I know so, Major. I know so. And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got. <+++++> But even then, we wouldn't get everything.
Break it. <+++++> I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
-- Eddie! ! <+++++> Over here.
You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein. <+++++> What d'you mean?
What makes you think I was there? <+++++> I couldn't tell you that. It would ruin the game.
"...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>..." <+++++> "And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
I...uh... <+++++> No speeches, Otis. Just watch what Albert has prepared. What are you waiting for?
Good. <+++++> I'd want to set out events as they happened. The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal.
Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets? <+++++> The Soviets are in control of the SAMs. It's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch.
Do you feed on mice and rats? <+++++> I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
I mean, I've got the whole package, right? A great life, a beautiful wife, and a few kids. <+++++> A <u>few</u>?
I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close. It's just-- <+++++> I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money. Father doesn't have any.
Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt. <+++++> Okay, okay. You're right.
No. <+++++> Sandy. this guy is a killer!! I promise you.
VADA! <+++++> Dad?
That her? <+++++> Yeah.
No. Invite us? No, he simply... <+++++> Then we cannot go.
Shit! <+++++> Take it easy. The glass is bullet resistant.
Northern Books. What can I do for you? <+++++> I need a typewritter.
You're nuts, goin' back there! <+++++> Shut up.
We want to attract them, not scare them off. <+++++> Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark. What am I supposed to do?
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up. <+++++> Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
Those guys bother you? <+++++> No, they're all right. I meant, you just got here.
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell? <+++++> What's that?
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs. <+++++> Oh!
Why did you wait? <+++++> It was not by choice. A small matter of a mountain falling down on us. We were trapped inside.
Sailor! <+++++> You up for that?
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really. <+++++> It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted. <+++++> Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
You. <+++++> Detective Yu? Never met him.
I want you to give up that terrible job. <+++++> Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move <+++++> No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you! <+++++> Kids.
Do your covers and all that shit. <+++++> 'Bye, Jeff.
I was? <+++++> Yeah.
The coca is my responsibility! <+++++> You're a fucking amateur!
And that's the power you have. <+++++> You believe that?
You haven't done that in a long time... <+++++> What...?
Yes, I would like to see Ben. <+++++> Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this way, sir.
No comment! <+++++> "Serial Mom"? WOW!
You get a chance to use it? <+++++> I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
I've got it. He bends down and bites the back of her neck. <+++++> Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not. So, you? Husbands? Boyfriends? Girlfriends? Where do you live? <+++++> I don't have anyone. But I do have a little apartment of my own. It has a little flower garden.
Did he explain how this happened? <+++++> He believed it all went back to one night, when as a little girl. I watched my parents have this big fight, really big.
No. You're trying to beat me. <+++++> We've always tried to beat each other.
An unhappy woman... <+++++> She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing. <+++++> He's right.
What are you talking about? <+++++> It skips from page nine to eleven. Where's page ten?
Don't you? <+++++> Are you manifesting them?
Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional. <+++++> Oh, is he a friend of yours?
I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges. <+++++> That's my job.
Wait a minute you need two. <+++++> No you don't. I do it all the time.
and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand? <+++++> Yes.
You're a fool. <+++++> Maybe.
Heh, heh. The man should be in a straight jacket. Feeling better? <+++++> Much, thank you. But I am a little lightheaded. Maybe I should eat something.
That ought to be a second team's approach. Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house. <+++++> How far away's the back-up?
It's lovely... I really like your aquarium. <+++++> Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
Nobody cares, Ronald. <+++++> Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow. You're depriving our famous young friend here...
Hear that? Are you hearing this? <+++++> No, I didn't hear anything. No, we're okay.
I don't see it as leaving. I see it as going home. <+++++> God, you're serious, aren't you?
What is it? <+++++> It's a thought I had.
It's warmer than I thought. <+++++> You want to go to a movie tonight?
The kid's with them! ! <+++++> What do you-?
No. Not true... <+++++> C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.
Three. And add some basil. <+++++> D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
Y'know what? I'm ready to cancel our trip. I really am. I've had it. <+++++> And I can't help having a cold.
But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'? <+++++> Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools?
I can't! <+++++> You know you must. There is only one. Now you are that one. It is time.
I'm sitting here, I'm looking at you and I'm having these flashes. You know, flashbacks, of memories. Of us. <+++++> Really.
They taught me at the FBI. I was very good at it. It scared me... I liked it. <+++++> You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer. Stay put.
John, John. <+++++> Don't do that!
Five. Since I've been here. <+++++> What happened to them?
He'll live... if we ever make it back. <+++++> We'll make it.
Hi Vada, can you come out? <+++++> I dunno..
What's the matter with you? <+++++> Nothing...nothing at all.
That country shit all sounds the same to me. <+++++> How about I pick one out for you?
Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick? <+++++> Well, yes.
Easy now, miss, I've got you?? ? <+++++> You've got me? Who's got you?? ?
Where are you going ... <+++++> I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens. <+++++> So how does it happen?
Who fired you? <+++++> You did.
Sandy? <+++++> Go ahead!
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at -- <+++++> No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old.
Yes, von der Null. <+++++> Von der Null?
He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over. <+++++> Do you remember his exact words?
No dances, just tell me. <+++++> The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
No, a... <+++++> ...hundred yards further down the road.
You boost her -- ? <+++++> Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
Three! I'm going to be late for my shift. <+++++> No! Don't go.
Please, enough with the wrestling! You've lost touch with reality! <+++++> What, you don't think I can beat him?
No. They don't. <+++++> Victor. This place looked like a charnel house. What went on here?
Sounds good. <+++++> I can get you what you want. You just have to talk to me.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet. Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont? <+++++> I wanted to see you.
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm. <+++++> A little respect would be nice, that's all.
I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington. <+++++> Eve! My understudy...
Not there. Under the mat. <+++++> Under the mat?
They're English soldiers, ain't they? <+++++> With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas. <+++++> Peace is made is such ways.
Hey hey, I'm not messing with your special lady-- <+++++> She's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend. I'm just helping her conceive, man!
You ready? <+++++> I will be in just a minute.
I heard that. <+++++> What was it?
Oh, Sandro... <+++++> I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
You know it's not often I... you know... <+++++> There's a first time for everything.
Will he be alright? <+++++> Oh, yeah... probably...
Oh, Mother, not the castor oil. <+++++> This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that.
Don't you remember? We were at the office party together -- <+++++> Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember? <+++++> Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy? Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
 <+++++> He's treading water. Don't mention Khrushchev.
Simulates? <+++++> Sure, after a fashion.
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government. Right? <+++++> That's the way it was told to me.
Ten percent. <+++++> You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
Did he buy it? <+++++> I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone. <+++++> And now you must let me be the judge of that!
It's Peter, Egon. I've got a problem. <+++++> What is it?
Hello? <+++++> Hi.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not? <+++++> Yes.
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy... <+++++> ...you have to <u>eat</u>...
He keeps talking about Anna Karenina. I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat. Its my idea of a man-to-man chat. <+++++> This is a different world - is what I tell myself. A different life. And here I am a different wife.
You've got to help me find the dog! I let their dog out. We need to find the dog. <+++++> You're not serious.
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella. <+++++> They killed Casy first.
Did you see my cat? <+++++> Yeah I did.
Right. Mars. <+++++> That a problem?
Sometimes. <+++++> I made a wish today, and it came true just like Edward said it would.
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown. <+++++> With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
So, Mark's working at the State Department now. <+++++> Really? What do you do there?
Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next. <+++++> Not, "Eternity Forever"? The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made? I'd kill for that part.
Are you ready? <+++++> Ready? We've got plenty of time.
Adrian. <+++++> Laurie! Good to see you.
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington. <+++++> Why should you?
I know, but... <+++++> What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass!
Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after -- <+++++> Now, Aim --
Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to Customs? <+++++> I'm not saying another word.
I know it was a bad idea to close the store. <+++++> Listen to you.
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard. <+++++> But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
There are none here. <+++++> Where are they?
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what? It's food now. <u>You're</u> eating it. <+++++> I didn't say it was bad for you, it's just kind of sickening, that's all.
Just carrying a bag. <+++++> Let's have a look, shall we?
And her...? <+++++> Took 28 hours. She just wasn't sure about entering this world.
Fabulous. <+++++> Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers?
I almost got married once. <+++++> Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
Six years. <+++++> And would you describe those years as happy?
Now ain't you relieved, Walt? <+++++> Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye.
That money is your per diem. <+++++> And where do we bring it?
What is this? <+++++> Hidden camera.
Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything. <+++++> I don't understand.
I'll get us out of here. <+++++> Don't worry about me. You take this time for your own, you two.....
Why is that, do you think? <+++++> Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups.
She what? <+++++> She's a friend of Jill's.
I don't know. <+++++> Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me.
Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride. <+++++> The car will stop?
He's too drunk. <+++++> He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go. You guys stay here.
I mean, we look like just another couple. But what are we? Doesn't it seem so crazy? <+++++> No.
Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy. <+++++> Did you?
That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there? <+++++> Huh?
Call the skank now or I start redecorating. <+++++> You haven't figured this out yet, have you?
Oh no. <+++++> What?
It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. <+++++> I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie. We'll let the salary stay where it is.
I understand. <+++++> 
What can we do to assist you? <+++++> Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend. <+++++> Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
Sailor? <+++++> Yeah?
Jeffrey, when you see your father. <+++++> Yeah?
I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's? <+++++> Guess I should have been telling your father.
Tell my son. You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me. <+++++> Tell me about it.
She's fine, Charles. Take it easy... <+++++> Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen.
Somebody was in here. <+++++> Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
Oh...Where does he live? <+++++> Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
What? <+++++> I want to talk to you for a second.
I don't know. <+++++> Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.
You think he's for real? <+++++> He's from another world.
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first. <+++++> Get me on the first shot, if you can.
Cease fire with the bullshit. <+++++> Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right.
I'm sorry. <+++++> Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said.
I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually. <+++++> Really?
...yes she did. <+++++> ...I heard different, thought that was...
I think everything's okay here. <+++++> I could check your prostate.
What's wrong with him? <+++++> He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine. We heard from Doctor Hudson?
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.' <+++++> The driver will...
It's gone. I feel it! <+++++> So do I!
You'll take fifty and like it! <+++++> Well, all right. But I'm liable to get into a jam.
I'll take him. <+++++> No way! He's mine!
When will they be back? <+++++> Mr De Moraes is due back from Brazil late this evening. Mrs De Moraes is out and not expected before eight. Do you wish...
 <+++++> Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
Got any crazy eights? <+++++> Go fish.
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here. <+++++> No harm, no foul. But you want to watch out for that road.
Everything's different. <+++++> Are you drunk?
And what do you think you will find in another land? <+++++> Maybe myself.
She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come... <+++++> Only if it's no closer than a hundred feet.
What? <+++++> I got bangs!
Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me? <+++++> Crash, shut the door.
That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line. <+++++> Apology acknowledged.
Spontaneous my ass!! You told the press and you don't tell me. Remember you're working for us. <+++++> Yeah... whatever you say.
Just don't. <+++++> ...Yes sir. Your quarters sir.
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles - <+++++> Where'm I going?
You need me, I'll be here all night. <+++++> Thanks, Max.
THEN WHAT? <+++++> Then you got undressed.
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom. <+++++> Prom? You're about twenty minutes late. She just left for the prom with her boyfriend Woogie.
If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing. <+++++> Wouldn't that be too bad. You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
Edmunds? Get in here. I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted. <+++++> She's not gonna know.
Don't you want to hear what's next? <+++++> What's next?
Well, there's a mall here now -- I mean, there will be. <+++++> A mall?
Okay, Harding, you're on. <+++++> Okay, sucker.
I'd really rather take care of it myself. <+++++> Spud, they're my sheets.
What's one way? <+++++> We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times.
I wish I could go. <+++++> We all do.
Why? Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..." <+++++> Where were you?
You're not going to phone anybody where I am. <+++++> Put down that gun, Earl.
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean? <+++++> Uh, it's a slogan. From, uh...
What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy? That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory -- <+++++> Hiding?
The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt. I don't care if we all go down together. <+++++> That's not how Pop would have played it.
I found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... Did you? <+++++> Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed. I'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again. <+++++> ALBERT, WHY TYLENOL?
Yeah, guess so. How'd you know? <+++++> TV. Helps numb [makes a "crazy gesture"] any active mind. [Sticking out a jittery hand] Rudy MacKenzie.
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions. <+++++> You should have been a marriage counselor. But I'll show you what's wrong with your theory.
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed. <+++++> I ate.
Are you ready? He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport. <+++++> Which is?
Get your links set up! <+++++> I wanna patch in from...
Hi Walter... <+++++> What are you doing here so early?
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back? <+++++> A parachute. This does not argue well.
So what do you need, Fergus? <+++++> Need to go across the water.
It depends. <+++++> It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
I was? How you spell that? <+++++> Cut the crap. You got a sheet the length of my arm...
Ten years is a long time. <+++++> Look -- I'm tired, I'll see you in the morning, Eddie.
Communist Viet Cong. <+++++> They left it in the jungle.
To relax. <+++++> I'm relaxed.
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do? <+++++> Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all... <+++++> Why not?
Let's talk about you. <+++++> I was an FO for the 25th.
I need to sit down a minute. <+++++> Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone else has.
Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated. <+++++> Cremated? !
Oooh. I love it. Hold me, touch me. <+++++> Thursday. I'll see you Thursday.
Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency. <+++++> Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris. Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like? <+++++> I don't know.
Throw it. <+++++> Sean! Catch it!
How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date? <+++++> I hear that's a rather popular date.
Let him try it. <+++++> The law is the law. Good-bye, Mary.
It'll be ready. <+++++> You're my man, Pete.
Sure, on me. I got Diner's Club. <+++++> Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite. You're making big trouble, Carmine.
Your uncle will like this. <+++++> He's not really my uncle.
I want to secure it. <+++++> Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank?
No, I mean I can check it for you. <+++++> Oh, sorry.
I'm gay. Does that surprise you? That I'm gay. You know what being gay is, don't you? <+++++> I reckon not.
The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that. <+++++> I should be going. I just quit.
'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville! You married? <+++++> No.
I want out. <+++++> Too late...They want you.
Just go. It's all right. Wyatt, Really. Work well. <+++++> All right, well, good night.
Yeah, but for what? <+++++> A good lay.
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere. <+++++> You'd be better off with tables and chairs.
God, I can't take it anymore! If I don't have Chris, I'll kill myself. <+++++> Knox, you gotta calm down.
Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary. <+++++> You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions. <+++++> I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it.
I heard you. You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.' <+++++> Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
You got my note! <+++++> Well ... yes ...
Addison wants me to play it. <+++++> Over my dead body...
I don't know yet. I think we'll be safe here. Let's bring that wood in. <+++++> What happens when we run out of wood?
What happened that night? <+++++> You promised you'd never ask me.
Yes. <+++++> He owned the entire water supply for the city?
I think I just broke my hand. <+++++> Harder. Remember, I killed your buddy.
I'm not used to that kind of treatment. <+++++> What kind of treatment?
No you don't. <+++++> If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
Came across the war party, tracked 'em. <+++++> Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me. <+++++> Why don't you tell me something for a change?
Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade. <+++++> Naturally.
Yeah. Yeah we get along well. You didn't get along with her very well? <+++++> Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff. <+++++> It's not a vacation, it's private school.
Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that. <+++++> There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
Now you done it! You busted it! <+++++> I never--
When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different! <+++++> I thought so too! I was sure you'd				* remember. But you didn't. *
What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force. <+++++> And where do you place Alexander?
Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted. <+++++> These are dilated. Take a look.
Actually I don't really know Mutt. <+++++> To fucking Mutt.
Knots! <+++++> I can see you're no gentleman--
How special? <+++++> You want one?
How about something to eat? <+++++> No, nothing.
What do you mean? <+++++> In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him.
That's the one. Whatever happened to him? <+++++> He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
My debrief -- <+++++> -- will be handled back in --
What? <+++++> I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy. <+++++> You mean the falsely accused?
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here. <+++++> Can I at least keep the onion soup?
I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide. <+++++> Right.
Joliet badge, Snyder. Don't cut much up here. <+++++> I'm lookin' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap. Thought he mighta come in here.
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather. <+++++> Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me. <+++++> Really, mama, I gotta go.
No dead body. Too bad. Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive! <+++++> I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston...
Hey! Someone's still in here. <+++++> Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny. <+++++> My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it.
No? Why not? You know something? Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday. Isn't that dumb? <+++++> No.
Why, yes. This is amazing. <+++++> If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school. <+++++> J. C. Penny's?
How could I be? The mainland has been found. Exactly as I said it would. <+++++> I am afraid this is not the worst news.
Yeah? Which terminal? <+++++> Sovereign.
Oh... <+++++> The world's southern most reaches.
Oh god, oh, god, no, I... <+++++> So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers.
We're ready when you are. <+++++> Microphone check. One. Two. One. Two. One. Two. Hold up. I gots to give my peeps some props.
Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late! Ivan is on his way here! <+++++> Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin!
You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right? <+++++> My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...
Two sticks have the power of four sticks. Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on. <+++++> I don't think so.
Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!! ! <+++++> No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow. <+++++> Then we'll all be doomed. Any other questions?
I thought there might be somebody inside. <+++++> Was there?
Look Jim. Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's-- <+++++> Are you going to preach now? Are we going to have a sermon?
You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker, didn't you? <+++++> Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge. And, frankly, I'm glad.
Hey, I showed 'em to you! <+++++> I remember..
I blame Tony Pee-Pants! <+++++> Oh, no. She tells this story at every major holiday.
Wait as long as you like. <+++++> You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
...yeah. <+++++> Aw, shit
Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job -- <+++++> Kill it, Duke. It's got us all spinning.
Yeah Kay, I'm here. <+++++> Can you say it?
Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off? <+++++> Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear.
The mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to. I'm going to need a lot of therapy. <+++++> It was Krueger, wasn't it?
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?' <+++++> - I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
Yeah... <+++++> Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
It's our job. <+++++> You think you accomplished something... like you're heroes? Fuck you! This is meaningless! You'll never win!
We can go to one if you'd prefer. <+++++> No, this is fine. I was just wondering.
Why didn't Annie stay for dinner? <+++++> She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
Why didn't you tell me? <+++++> Ann, when would I have told you? We were not speaking, if you recall.
It's a thing she does. She talks at night. <+++++> Talks all day, too! How the hell can you put up with her, John?
We're very specialized. <+++++> Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
Tuesday is ladies' night. <+++++> What?
As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.' <+++++> Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Did you set me up? Did you set me up just to see me fail? <+++++> Absolutely not.
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am. <+++++> This ain't a groc'ry store. We got bread to make san'widges with.
You want your women on pedestals. But they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up. <+++++> I can't help how I think. You're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change.
I don't know what that means. <+++++> Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
Would you like to deposit this in your account? <+++++> No. The money, please.
Well...? <+++++> It's not the one...Wait... there's a label.
Cast iron? <+++++> Yes.
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around. <+++++> You've been out for about a day.
 <+++++> Annie---
Sure. <+++++> Go in there and get us two slushees.
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good. <+++++> What happened?
I have to find Kelly! <+++++> I think she's with Sarah!
You should do something about this lock. <+++++> She's evil. She's brilliant. Be careful, Nick.
Why did you make me flood the school? <+++++> We just want to guide you in the right direction.
Paul... ...I have to talk to you. <+++++> I'll be back.
Someone has to do something. <+++++> Don't push it this time. If you do, it won't turn out the way you want, I guarantee you that.
Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right. <+++++> How will it?
That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer. <+++++> You think so?
No more, Lenny. <+++++> Yeah. I'm ghosting pretty bad.
Didn't Hoover say something about that? The leaves had fallen off in November? <+++++> It was a Texas Live Oak, boss. It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.
I usually take lunch by the River. <+++++> It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates. At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
Yeah? <+++++> But more laughter than tears, I think? Yes. On balance?
Alvy. <+++++> Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
What is that? <+++++> Piss.
She's not tied up! <+++++> You know what I mean. You're keeping her there against her will.
I'm Admiral Kirk... <+++++> <u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --
What's up? <+++++> Listen, Kirkhill. I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.
You miss him, don't you? <+++++> It's been a long time, Ma.
Excellent work, Joe. I thank you. <+++++> It was good working with you, Andrew. You're welcome. Hey. Shouldn't you put that thing back on?
Who stuck up the laundromat? <+++++> How about that time you were picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?
I got surprises for everybody! <+++++> Bought at the airport.
You're certain about tomorrow? But you don't seem excited. <+++++> You don't enjoy killing, do you?
What? <+++++> There's something you have to know, Gretchen. Everything is going to be just fine.
Amanda is Eddie's cousin. <+++++> Eddie from Compost?
Rayette. <+++++> What?
I've got a six strobe. I think he's locked on us. <+++++> It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
I want a word with you ... <+++++> Oh--well ...
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old. <+++++> But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
Everyone take their places on the stage! Isn't this thrilling? ! <+++++> But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have. <+++++> You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
That's right. <+++++> Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
What do you think we're doing, dad? <+++++> What do I think? I think you're probably touching each other.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir. <+++++> All right, it's a matter of death.
Move the bodies. <+++++> Move the bodies?
Not a clue. You? <+++++> I think he just likes pointing at things.
I just putter. <+++++> Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
Get in, Mom! I have to open. <+++++> This is so silly.
Oh. It looks like a hearse. Very nice. Compact. <+++++> Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs. <+++++> Well sir, I was an ironmaster before you got me. Maybe I will let you down yet.
You look awful. <+++++> Thanks.
I feel sure of it. <+++++> I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me. <+++++> So now you tracked me down. What d'ya think?
You've asked me that one three times. <+++++> Here's a fresh one. Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
That's an outrageous lie! <+++++> 
You're welcome. <+++++> Leave here. Don't do this. I don't want you here.
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not. <+++++> So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself.
But why? <+++++> You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say. <+++++> Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
What question? <+++++> Bill. Come on. The question.
I wasn't expecting you. <+++++> Wanted to wish you luck. Not that you'll need it.
Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings? <+++++> Yes, he's just adorable.
Okay, Lovey. <+++++> And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here.
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said. <+++++> She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
Albert's got the stomach flu. <+++++> That's too bad.
Got some o.j. ? <+++++> Yeah.
I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are! <+++++> Are we? I thought I was very gay.
So why'd you give up ball? <+++++> Why do you keep asking me that?
You don't? <+++++> No.
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry. <+++++> Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table. <+++++> We're in Pleasantville?
It's good protein. Come on, Lex. Why don't you touch it? Look at his nose. <+++++> This is a seventy-seven ton animal. Come on over, Lex! Just think of it as a big cow. Look at it's teeth?
I don't want to talk about it. <+++++> You know, you never tell me anything.
Of course, dear. You're home now. <+++++> I'm home now.
That was weird. I meant good. <+++++> Maybe you said that because you're hungry.....
It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me. <+++++> I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
Is this supposed to be an apology? <+++++> ItÂs not supposed to be anything, Kat. ItÂs just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I donÂt know.
Why are we going to do that? <+++++> Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
Where'd you get this? <+++++> I found it outside.
Let's just do it, all right? <+++++> Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?
Are you depressed about your daddy, honey? <+++++> No.
I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me. <+++++> Shut the fuck up and do what I say!
Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch? <+++++> Yes sir. Negative effect.
I really was way way too too. <+++++> Oh, please! When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
You're the first person to ever call me tough. <+++++> Like recognizes like. I'm pretty tough, myself.
We're family, Caesar. <+++++> No!
Shit, that was fast. <+++++> 12-year olds. They scare easy. Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash. Come with me.
Where are they taking him? <+++++> To be hanged.
Are you offering me a bribe? <+++++> I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
I mean they want to get caught. <+++++> Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job.
I'm tired, Hector. I know this because you're beginning to not bug me. <+++++> That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful. Nightcap?
I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to. You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it. <+++++> As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything -  I don't want anything now - except what you want.
Do you think the rex might have the infant with it? <+++++> Possible.
Would you... would you like to see my mother? <+++++> Your mother?
We need signatures. To overturn the ballot. I can supply those, Oswald. <+++++> I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
Ad lib? <+++++> In fact, I want you to ad lib, that's the magic I'm after. I wanna give a whole new feel to the show.
What's this big, big news? <+++++> What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
What if-- <+++++> What if <u>what</u>?
It's a <u>sketch</u>, Anna--it's not to- scale cartography; the tree was not the kids' focus-- <+++++> --do you <u>agree</u> it's that <u>old</u>, Nick?
There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might... <+++++> Sex with Simon?
Hey! ! <+++++> You threw it at me! !
Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn. Rape films, but there aren't many. I've never seen one. <+++++> Snuff films.
Maybe I don't see it that way. <+++++> Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine.
Yes? <+++++> I never knew that music like that was possible.
There is no invasion... <+++++> Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
What is it, kid? <+++++> C-C-Come here and l-look at th this!
Is there any chance of them surviving out there? <+++++> Slim, but yes, there's a chance. They have a shelter. It's not much, but ...
The angel... the angel of death. I'm scared, Ned. Ned, I'm gonna die. <+++++> Easy, Bill, easy.
Friend? <+++++> A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
 <+++++> Well--I have got *one* idea--
You told me you'd say that. <+++++> Abort the plan.
- and for you. <+++++> You're quite a girl.
I know that... <+++++> Is...Is the Movie!
I'm Neo-Senephrened out. Think I'm catching a cold. <+++++> Better than catching Sean's herpes.
I know how he found me. <+++++> It's called a transponder.
A cloud. <+++++> A cloud?
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him? <+++++> What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
I didn't know... I didn't... It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I... <+++++> They tricked you.
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious? <+++++> It gets me through the day.
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious. <+++++> You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me.
So this is a big deal, commander and  all? <+++++> 
This is it? What am I gonna do with this? Holy shit! <+++++> It's all we got.
Why not? ! <+++++> Because...  We're just friends. That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it. I see the whole thing now.
Your liquor laws.. <+++++> Disgusting, aren't they? If you really want a Martini, I know where you can get one.
I mean, what do you think? <+++++> You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.
Then you would have gotten your money? <+++++> Yes.
And you're going to lead us. <+++++> Yeah. Me?
They' re dead. <+++++> Oh my God ... Ann?
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there? <+++++> Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world. <+++++> I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
Then we'll go home? <+++++> Then we'll go home.
Who d'ya think you're foolin'? I know you better than you think... <+++++> ...You're hurting me...
You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic. <+++++> Yes, I know who he is.
Okay. <+++++> So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.
What are you gonna do about it? <+++++> Ooh, I'll think of something, missy. A telescope? Where you going? I don't want to know.
I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them. You hearing anything? <+++++> Nothing.. But stay within a quarter mile...I've got a three-mile radius on the monitor. If he comes back I'll hear him.
You down? <+++++> Yeah, we're down.
He'd give me a job. <+++++> He would take you on. Yes.
Diane 1. <+++++> Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy. <+++++> You give up on her?
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up... <+++++> Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
That's right. <+++++> Dammit, Will. Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday. <i>Five</i> hours.
Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy? <+++++> Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children -- <+++++> This child let loose the beast from its cage --
They're not tricks. They're behavior patterns. <+++++> Fine. Have them do some.
What? <+++++> How long have you known Hoagie?
That's easy. Me. <+++++> 
Of course not. <+++++> You could help us.
Story, honey? Why, what story? <+++++> About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
Gee - look at that. I didn't know alligators came this far up on shore <+++++> Mm-hmm...
-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story. <+++++> I don't have a story.
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams. <+++++> You should always listen to your subconscious. It's trying to tell you something about your waking life.
David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second? <+++++> Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here.
It's a stretch but I'll manage. <+++++> The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important. <+++++> Hey, thanks, man.
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you? <+++++> No.
Vous Ãªtes FranÃ§ais? <+++++> Does it matter?
What do you think? <+++++> I think I could do something  provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.
No. Face it now. Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys. <+++++> How can you say that? Especially after today?
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and -- <+++++> Don't worry about it. I'll stay.
Did you know my mother died recently? <+++++> Yes I did, I'm sorry.
But that was her order! <+++++> I'm fed up with taking her orders.
Mom -- Who is this? <+++++> Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
My power cells continually re- charge themselves. <+++++> I can't imagine what it would be like to be a machine.
Ruby... this guy almost took out an entire Tactical Response Team. You can't expect me to just leave you -- <+++++> He doesn't look like he's going anywhere, Bill.
That was over thirty years ago. I paid for that and then some. <+++++> You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?
He's comin' back?. What for? <+++++> 'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude. <+++++> You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
Jim, Jim, you saw my book...I can't, you saw my book... <+++++> But we have to before Monday. To get our money ba...
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies? <+++++> Yes.
...you <u>are</u> an orphan. <+++++> But... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>. I used it. To <u>bargain</u>.
God, I can't keep up with all your changes. <+++++> Me neither.
Uh...the admitting nurse... <+++++> What did she do?
I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid. <+++++> Stop it. When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.
You might not have done it had you known. <+++++> You're damn right! I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
So it's off to London for a week? New York for a month? L.A Forever? <+++++> It was fucking '60 Minutes II'! I couldn't say no! I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you? <+++++> Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it. <+++++> Made what?
I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rose? <+++++> Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
Mike's gotta go. Nice to meet you. <+++++> Yeah, nice meetin' you.
I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs. <+++++> I was wrong.
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go. <+++++> Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
As much as possible. <+++++> As much as possible?
Come on, you! Before we slap you down. <+++++> Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
Good. Good. That's terrific... <+++++> What?
Razor and Blade! They're flakes! <+++++> They're elite! Let's get 'em.
No. <+++++> But, this could be serious.
Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good employee. <+++++> What do you mean?
Which way did she fall? <+++++> She... she fell over backwards.
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier. <+++++> 
No. <+++++> Well, I shouldn't expect miracles, should I?
I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you. <+++++> Mm.
Dude, how can you hate the environment? <+++++> 'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.
Accommodate? I don't think I know what you mean. <+++++> I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
Charlotte?! How's Tokyo? <+++++> It's cool... but,I don't know...
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute. <+++++> She's adorable. But I had to end it.
I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way. <+++++> Love?
Sorry. <+++++> Don't let it happen again.
What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean? <+++++> It means I got the money.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget. <+++++> Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house! <+++++> Well, sir...
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet. <+++++> Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
I'll go up and take a look at the General Â- perhaps sit with him. <+++++> He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
The money was sent. <+++++> Then you have to trace it. Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man.
How come Karl won't eat here with us? <+++++> I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there.
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions... <+++++> If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...
I won't. Goodnight. <+++++> 'Night.
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter. <+++++> And as a sane person. For you that must be quite a stretch.
What are you going to do? <+++++> We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
I donÂt think so, thank you... <+++++> CÂmon, as soon as I put them down, youÂre gonna grab a couple...you always do...
Uh-huh. <+++++> Your sister told me hands off, but I can't help myself...
I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow. <+++++> You could sell your Beamer.
Frank is coming? <+++++> No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.
No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian. <+++++> It's okay.
That's it. <+++++> Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.
I answer to Grissom, punk. Not to you. <+++++> Why, Eckhardt. You should be thinking about the future.
Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie- <+++++> I'll do it.
No. <+++++> You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more. He made a big settlement on you.
What do you mean? <+++++> That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books... <+++++> Where?
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin. <+++++> Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Did you kill anyone? <+++++> I don't like to talk about that.
These are good. <+++++> Mm-hmm.
Kids think it's normal. They think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes... <+++++> Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.
I tell you, something's not right here. How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves? <+++++> Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
Let us cancel the engagement. <+++++> But, Madam. cannot do that.
Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the pound. You don't need to count it. <+++++> I still will, if you don't mind.
Why? <+++++> Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is. <+++++> Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
Yeah. <+++++> That seems so far away from who you are now. What happened?
Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look! <+++++> Whatever it is, it's coming from down there. I'm going down to see.
Oh. What? <+++++> Very big spider.
Whoa... she just farted. <+++++> I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
Get off my roof! <+++++> Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
I wish. <+++++> Neosporin?
Donuts here any good? <+++++> I don't eat junk food.
Really. <+++++> But -- wait.
Sit tight. I'm on my way. <+++++> Well, hurry up. The needle's going wild.
I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck. <+++++> No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that.
I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo. This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk. <+++++> It is very difficult. Diego makes me a lot of money. If Diego goes so does the money. You were an excellent teacher, George.
My goal is to make art. <+++++> So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
Why, how industrious. And how did you open protected files, may I ask? <+++++> Well I figured that your password was "Finster." Your Pomeranian. And it was.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun. <+++++> Doesn't look like it much matters.
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me? <+++++> That's what I tried to find out.
What's happening? What's going on? <+++++> It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
You said the slave had a crucifix... <+++++> Oh, that rumour about crosses?
Am I in charge of this thing? Or not. <+++++> I said you were...
...Who they playin'? <+++++> OOOoooh! His reaction synchronizes with a reaction from the crowd.
Yeah. <+++++> Whole country or just hereabouts?
I know. <+++++> Well, nothing we can do about it. Come into my house. You can stay with me, until I build you your own place.
Go ahead. Say it. <+++++> You get the idea.
What? <+++++> What happened, Major? Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy. <+++++> WHAT?!! What are you talking about? !
Thank you, Mr. Lawson. <+++++> Don't mention it. Whoever-you-are.
He likes it. <+++++> Of course he does. What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
I'm used to paying my own bills. <+++++> You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
Snuff films. <+++++> I heard you asking. That guy wasn't yanking you around. There's no such thing.
You must think I'm some kind of fool. <+++++> It looks delicious.
I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine-- <+++++> What're you, a fucking marriage counselor?
Why? <+++++> Just have you for one second, please.
Maybe he's just shy. <+++++> My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
Why, are you not ready to die for your king? <+++++> Of course I am, it's just that...
What is it? <+++++> The...Silver...Mike...Award!
... That's great. <+++++> So you see, I'm not going anywhere. Unless it's upstairs with you ...
To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth. <+++++> Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it. <+++++> You don't have to feel any way about it. Lecter did it to amuse himself. Why not, what can they do?
There, you said it. <+++++> Said what?
I'm so glad to see you. What's the occasion? <+++++> I'm in town on a case. Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.
Shut your big fat mouth! <+++++> I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
Just do what I do. Say the same thing I say. Don't open your mouth. <+++++> Okay.
Oh, MiGod. <+++++> Guess who <u>I</u> am.
You don't remember me, do you? <+++++> We know each other?
You have to stop being so self- critical Frida. <+++++> I looked like an Italian man!
On the contrary. Let me take up this matter with the Marquis myself -- <+++++> And place my reputation at stake?
What? <+++++> I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
You know what gets me? <+++++> Go home!
Is that a game? <+++++> It's a great game! You should play sometime. I bet you'd be good. You seem very athletic. Do you have any hobbies?
Any luck? <+++++> No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
Dad? <+++++> Son?
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls? <+++++> Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
Well? <+++++> Well what?
Tomorrow. <+++++> What's up? Why're leavin' Detroit?
Yes? <+++++> I found it.
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days. <+++++> Well, where are all of you off to?
It's the boy next door throwing at his birds. I'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window <+++++> I'm going to wash up now. You all please excuse me.
I guess so. <+++++> Fuck guessing. You keep your mouth shut.
I had him hooked. He was just about to ask me out. I could tell. <+++++> That guy's a jerk. I did you a favor.
You're going alone? <+++++> No. Myers is taking me.
Good shot, Red Two. <+++++> Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.
If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him. <+++++> Chum?
I do. I'm -- are you...? <+++++> I... I think I am...
It was a dream, Star. <+++++> No, Laddie. It was a <u>memory</u>.
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial? <+++++> Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
Huh? <+++++> You called the police?
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy. <+++++> I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other -- <+++++> -- Okay, so you don't like me. You don't like everything I've done.
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's... The Man With The Eyes In His Hands... <+++++> You still feel that crazy...?
What is it? <+++++> It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer.
 <+++++> He did?
What he has it empathy and projection. He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him. <+++++> Why aren't you ever alone with him?
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause. <+++++> Jade, I still love you.
That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest? <+++++> Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
You just burned the desk. <+++++> What's happening?
You must believe me. You must come with me while there's still time. <+++++> Time to do what?
Don't worry about it, all right? <+++++> Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
Hello? <+++++> Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
Did you think that we'd all be looking at you? <+++++> No, no, no.
It's gone now. <+++++> Because you have hope that you'll get better?
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth. <+++++> I promise... I swear.
Removal Point? What're you talking about! <+++++> We have no alternative. With only six minutes left, we'll just barely make it.
It is. <+++++> Do you always open quickly?
He was curious from birth - premature by two weeks, as if he couldn't wait to get started. <+++++> Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
You don't pick your brother. <+++++> Yeah.
Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter. <+++++> Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.
Now? <+++++> This "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas.
I only wish there were something I could do for you. <+++++> But you have.
But that one night? <+++++> I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go.
Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts? <+++++> Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
You're not...an orphan are you? <+++++> My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out! <+++++> If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.
In there. Charlie Penny owns the place. We knew no one would ever find it. I'm not even sure I can find it again. <+++++> How do we get in?
You're the only person in this place who can see right through me. <+++++> You've made us look pretty good in the past week. And the way you handled the press --
What? <+++++> The truth.
I'm exaggerating. <+++++> How much?
IS THAT YOU, KID? <+++++> Why would the Kid shoot at us?
Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay? <+++++> Okay, Mom.
Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig. <+++++> Oh, Adam. I don't have gloves. My nails keep getting longer. I'll break them.
I'd never do that. <+++++> Get married?
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing? <+++++> Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
Yessir. <+++++> Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?
Why, Matt! <+++++> What are you doing here?
Yes, but I'm going to live at home. <+++++> Remind me to talk to your mother about the dress code. I'm sure you're going to be very happy there.
I've got to move on. I mean, I've got needs, too. I told you about all this. <+++++> No, you didn't. When?
We killed them, didn't we? <+++++> Of course.
You've got no choice. <+++++> Whata you mean I've got no choice?
What is this place? <+++++> This is the Philosophical Research Society. A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.
What's going on? When do we get paid off...? <+++++> Soon, Captain... Quite soon.
Difficult? He's impossible! <+++++> That's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.
Get away from there, convict! <+++++> Just browsing. Don't touch me....
But you can do the same thing in six months. The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life. <+++++> My mind is made up. She will not set foot in my house again.
He's good. He's fine. <+++++> I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an eye on Nicky. Do it for me.
Cause I don't think <u>this</u> dog is gonna hunt.... <+++++> He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
But you didn't do that. <+++++> Because I didn't have it. Ray, I swear, Melanie came in and grabbed it. And someone killed her for it.
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy. <+++++> Everything is.
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently. <+++++> The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams.
So do I. <+++++> Came  on back. Let me show you where it fits in.
How's it going for you two? <+++++> Not well.
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age. <+++++> Are you getting tired?
I know a little. I studied it in my youth. <+++++> Where?
Oh, my God... <+++++> Does it hurt? A lot? Good.
It made them holy. <+++++> It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets?
I can't resist. <+++++> Really? How flattering! Did you try the shrimp puffs?
Who? <+++++> Rene Crain. Up there. Rope. Ship's hawser. Hard to tie. Don't know how she got it.
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together. <+++++> Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing.
You know. <+++++> You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
And come to the printshop. You know <u>why</u>...? <+++++> ...the better to eat me with, your dear?
I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays "Happy Birthday" to its User once a year. <+++++> Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
You're supposed to get hurt! <+++++> Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football. He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
That's great Earl! <+++++> Yep, fifteen thousand BTU's, enough to cool off this whole place.
These are your initials, 'K.C. '? <+++++> Kathy Costello. That's my maiden name.
But I never know when you're working and when you're not working! <+++++> Neither do I, baby.
They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment. <+++++> ... fifty thousand dollars?
They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here. <+++++> Well, is it?
Also...stay out of the "Adult Bookstore." <+++++> Adult Bookstore. Why?
You did. <+++++> That's right. Now who needs to trust who ?
Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her? <+++++> At a funeral.
You're there. <+++++> Yeah. I'm here.
Now--turn around, if you would. <+++++> Turn around?
You come! You speak first! <+++++> Tell the Chief we thank him.
Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood. <+++++> Ah, I see.
Expecting anyone? <+++++> What?
Age? <+++++> Twenty-six.
Sure. <+++++> Okay.
I'd like you to meet my father. <+++++> Oh--won't YOU come in?
So do I. <+++++> Objection!
I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl. <+++++> Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a Jew in the head. <+++++> I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
I told him I don't know. I still don't. <+++++> How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is. <+++++> Oh Jesus.
"Arkady" <+++++> Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it.
'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.' <+++++> You said it.
---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP-- <+++++> Why didn't we get that?
That's all I ever wanted! <+++++> Then I will teach you.
She's got to be found. That's the first step. She's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police. <+++++> We've tried so long to find her.
Just some people from work... <+++++> I don't believe you.
YOU DO? ! <+++++> Sure, dude. On the face of every child, on the smile of every baby...
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started. <+++++> Do you have to swear all the time?
I don't know... <+++++> You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that. No way. I've never killed a man. Never even shot at one...
Gabe are you alright? <+++++> For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright. When I secure the line, come on up.
I was drying out. <+++++> I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy. Craig, what the hell wrong with you? Where you been? <+++++> Have you seen Day-Day?
Can I help you? <+++++> I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too. <+++++> Yes sir, I reckon it does.
Umm, Ummmmm <+++++> Just, hurry.
Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups. <+++++> I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then.
I can't tell you how distraught I was. All night long. What the hell happened? <+++++> I was attacked.
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda. <+++++> Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
This is beyond you or even me. It's the country, John. It's the presidency. <+++++> I understand that, sir.
What are you drinking, love? <+++++> I've forgotten.
Huh? <+++++> ...a little, uh, hey! A little hug! What is this? Now how 'bout a little action from the kids?
I don't know. Something. <+++++> A deer?
Arlo! Arlo. <+++++> Reach into my pocket.
Rita, he's only twelve years old, <+++++> He'll never appreciate it more.
Marty, ignore him. <+++++> He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one? What's the sense in risking six guys to save one? <+++++> Ours is not to reason why.
Would I what? <+++++> Would you kill her?
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you. <+++++> Michelle went for you, right.
What is it? <+++++> Open it...
No, I want long shifts. <+++++> We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody. <+++++> They got telephones.
You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear. <+++++> Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
Elena!...But when... <+++++> I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here...
Oh. Oh! Has Miss Dawson called yet? <+++++> Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
Drunk-rolling job. They hit him too hard. <+++++> I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years. This man hadn't been dead an hour. He wasn't killed last night.
Yeah, yeah. I was just thinking. It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point. <+++++> I agree.
It's all right, Mickey. <+++++> 
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away! <+++++> What, darling?
No. <+++++> See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.
The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West." <+++++> It is a nice piece of writing.
Shut up, will you? You sure? Nobody? <+++++> Duffy!!!! Duffy!!!! Well, where is Duffy? Diabetes!
ItÂs Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend? <+++++> Oh... We split up.
And why was the alarm on? <+++++> Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
Rene... <+++++> I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
Mad, Ma? <+++++> Sometimes they do.
Understand? <+++++> Yes, sir!
You're Walker, right? <+++++> Yes Sir.
I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you. <+++++> Get - get up!
Go hard! <+++++> Ram it in and break it off!
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow. <+++++> Why? Why not? Where are you goin'?
Keeps to himself, more like. <+++++> You have his address?
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him. <+++++> Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley? <+++++> Have you been to the water board?
How about it...? Look at yourself and write down the truth. Or maybe you're afraid to. <+++++> You're a tough one, aren't you?
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and -- <+++++> -- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
Could we sit down someplace? <+++++> I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
The fax is from Ben, too. Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone... <+++++> ... maybe it's congratulations.
Do you know who was brought in for questioning? <+++++> There were at least three, maybe four.
Two hours. <+++++> How long were you with the girl?
You look splendid, John. <+++++> Thank you very much.
A week. We were waiting for the right time to-- <+++++> I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
What do you think Mrs. Graham wants to see me for? <+++++> Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?
So that's what you been doing? <+++++> Damn skippy.
Why not? <+++++> I don't think so.
Without hope there's no point to anything. <+++++> Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing.
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while. <+++++> With about twenty of his spies on my tail. No thanks.
I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out. It's got him shitting peach pits. <+++++> Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
He could've called first. <+++++> He could've. That-That's true. But that would've been smart...
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before. <+++++> Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
I was gonna tell ya. Hey, it's just a job. I feel like shit about it. <+++++> You should feel like shit.
Haldeman. Right? <+++++> I won't talk about the other two.
As large as castles. You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me. <+++++> It doesn't make sense.
Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey. <+++++> Get out!
Thanks for the movie, Randy. <+++++> Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
I know he really likes you. <+++++> How do you know that? Did he say something?
...this close... <+++++> In five years?
You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it. <+++++> Yeah... I guess.
Will it keep them out? <+++++> Yeah...
...People catch on quick to such an item. Van Cleve already called me - he's firing the quintet. <+++++> Then what are you doing here? Go over there and fight! If Van Cleve fires your boy, it gives a lie the ring of truth!
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made? <+++++> It was the principle. Dunwitty had to be enlightened. I was making a point. I take pride in my work.
Did he promise? <+++++> Scout's honor.
I thought that was part of the charm! <+++++> I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.
What am I doing here? There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this. Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy. <+++++> "You could be swinging on a star."
No. <+++++> Do they have an X-rated channel?
What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do? <+++++> Haven't thought about it.
Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like... <+++++> Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
You rented an automated litter box. <+++++> It's a rapid prototyper.
I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT? <+++++> I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
You promise? <+++++> I promise.
Oh. <+++++> I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape.
Try to sense what it's telling you. It's the only thing you can rely on. <+++++> What do I do?
Come on back up here! <+++++> Nope.
Back is in New York. <+++++> Your wife knows that, don't she?
Yes Basil? <+++++> Be careful!
The money would go to Frank. The court would put the money in the hands of a relative -- <+++++> -- that can't happen. Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
Was it? <+++++> I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy? <+++++> Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow. Tough break.
What? <+++++> Send him home. You don't want him to see it.
CTU. Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up. <+++++> What do you mean, frame-up?
Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House. <+++++> I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
Lenny? You're an asshole. <+++++> Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
Now? Now? <+++++> Now. Yes...When?
It surrounds you and radiates from you. A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here! <+++++> Could I learn to feel it?
Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok? <+++++> All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.
Next you'll be sick. <+++++> I feel really good.
It's all right, Mr. McCleery. <+++++> Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
What...what is that? <+++++> A story?
I asked if you felt like a drink-- <+++++> No. No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
No. <+++++> You sure?
We have an investment in Tom Grunemann. The Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves. <+++++> Private investigation, you mean. Yes sir, of course you're entitled, and there's some very competent --
Doesn't hurt to ask. Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest. <+++++> That's a crock of shit.
Would you rather I not smoke? <+++++> No, I guess it's okay.
You're a moron, you know that? <+++++> Yeah.
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look. <+++++> Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.
Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight. Victoria harbor. If you don't want to... <+++++> Did you tell Sterling?
Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member. <+++++> Your marks would suggest great injury.
*You* taught her, I suppose... <+++++> That's right! A girl's gotta know how to defend herself, don't she?
You get a translator, Captain? <+++++> I've got a line on one.
Been away. Up to Houston. <+++++> Houston, huh? I hear they let you boys run wild up there.
Don't judge me. You're a joke, coming here from a fucked-up culture, telling us what to do! <+++++> Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla? <+++++> Oh, I don't know. Smart people. Creative people I guess.
Friend of yours? <+++++> I'm glad they let you out.
If he arrives before us, it will be too late. <+++++> Did you say 'kill' my sister?
When ya got all that blood workin' in your belly, it ain't upstairs where it needs to be. <+++++> The kid just called me stupid.
Well -- did you get it, Thorwald? <+++++> Who are you?
No. <+++++> Well what then?
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store. <+++++> Which ones?
Well please leave a message that I called. <+++++> I'll do that.
Nice place. <+++++> Thank you.
And this is...  ...Clark. My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for... <+++++> I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry. See you around, pal.
Then why the hell are you sitting around here? <+++++> Right.
Then why do you want to talk about it? <+++++> I don't.
DonÂt tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards. <+++++> Huh. IÂm a businessman. What are you, eh?
I'm sure it is. <+++++> You'll think about my offer?
Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it? <+++++> And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
In fact, no one here tonight has not been in <u>Vanity Fair</u>. Except you. <+++++> I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class. <+++++> Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me. <+++++> How many?
It's not time yet. My mission is not over yet. There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home. <+++++> But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
You're leading again. <+++++> Sorry.
I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal. <+++++> I don't think you're normal.
Geronimo is down. <+++++> It's up. Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
I don't want you to lie. <+++++> The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
Because <u>that's how people treat each other</u>! <+++++> Not in my world.
Mom, this is a farm. We've got real strawberries growing outside, we've got real cream. <+++++> Oh no, the prodigal son's home. We bring out the store bought.
Then I will respectfully take leave of her. <+++++> You will do as you please. It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.
Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee. <+++++> Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
I'm putting my stuff on the right, okay? <+++++> Okay.
Oh, sure. Great. <+++++> I'll pick you up.
Hey, guys, I'm outta here. <+++++> Thanks for the help.
What about the game? ! <+++++> I'm not playing.
What's with you two? <+++++> Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.
Stepmother. <+++++> ... asked you for something, didn't she? I'm going down to relax. I want a noise-free zone. Do you understand? Noise free.
You said that was an accident. <+++++> I lied. The House is alive and we're all gonna die.
What's wrong? <+++++> Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
I don't know -- <+++++> I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
My pleasure. I'm Orson Welles. <+++++> Oh. Um, I'm Ed Wood! So, what are you working on now?
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up! <+++++> I'm on my way.
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled. <+++++> Sarcastic right? You know the boys in the band are probably gonna stay over tonight. We'd be glad to have you.
Quite a while. As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all. <+++++> You're not?
You read my mind. <+++++> Put your pilot on.
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche. <+++++> I know that niche.
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time. <+++++> Here--where are you running off to?
You poor, poor boy. <+++++> Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it? Mint sauce or cranberries?
You're sure? We should still -- we should write it down. <+++++> Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you. <+++++> You've got a legitimate job.
What's down there? <+++++> The...Fourth of July.
So am I. My friends were killed, too. <+++++> I am truly sorry.
May I ask what you're doing? <+++++> Shhh!
You're talking to me. <+++++> And how'm I doing?
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you? <+++++> All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to. You'll be fine on your own? <+++++> Yes. Perfectly.
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir. <+++++> You better check it, Unger.
Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do? Mom! <+++++> Damn.
I don't need one. <+++++> Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
Refresh my memory. <+++++> How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
None of your business. <+++++> Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice. <+++++> Oh, I'm sorry about that.
This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want? <+++++> No, almost never.
Yeah, but the margins are real wide. <+++++> It is 350 pages of ... ABSOLUTE INSPIRATION!
She can't see you, right? In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead. <+++++> Won't? Or can't?
It's so unfair. <+++++> Of course it's unfair! We're women. Our choices are never easy.
I sincerely hope so-- <+++++> Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
Alexandretta. It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy. <+++++> Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior...
Damn it, child! Now look what you made me do. <+++++> What I made you do, mama?
Now? <+++++> Yes.
Next year. Next year. Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire... <+++++> I love those doors.
The winning side would have paid you much better. <+++++> Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly -- <+++++> He --
What kind now, Leo? <+++++> I don't know. Let's see. We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
You think that's what's-happening? <+++++> I think that's what's happening...
No, wait, are you- <+++++> Lt. Madison, GO.
Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you... <+++++> Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
Impressions? Those are hard. <+++++> Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
You go to hell. <+++++> What did you say?
...and that power... <+++++> ...without caution...
We're outta motion lotion. <+++++> I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers. <+++++> I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial. <+++++> I've considered that.
Is it all right if we smell it? <+++++> Just don't drool on it.
I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events. <+++++> Yes.
Will that stop the tear? <+++++> You got me, Commander.
There is something missing here. <+++++> You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
And what's that? <+++++> Jam.
Has it got a wow finish? <+++++> I don't know the finish yet.
Thanks again for everything. <+++++> Hey, don't thank me. Somebody up there likes you.
Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday. <+++++> Thanks for the message.
Rick, I'm concerned. <+++++> About what?
Don't touch him. <+++++> Graham.
 <+++++> It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck <+++++> Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
No Moulan Yan can be trusted. The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here. In the back. <+++++> How do you know this?
Yes, ma'am. <+++++> Where were you?
Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself! <+++++> You ride like a Comanche.
But no! Thirty three years of dedication and research, and all I've got to show for it is a bootleg video operation! <+++++> 
We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China. I'm on your wing. <+++++> And I'm on yours. Land of the free.
How much did you have? <+++++> A hundred grams.
Yes. <+++++> Yes what?
There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville. I could be induced to arrange a passage. <+++++> My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote. <+++++> What report?
I been studyin' a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it. <+++++> What's that?
Oh. Well, yes. <+++++> How many languages do you speak?
Ms. Kramer. <+++++> Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does.
Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder. <+++++> Who's scruffy-looking? I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.
What are you trying to say? <+++++> In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
I'll try to hold it from the other side of the wall, while you push from out here. Maybe that'll do it. <+++++> You can't --it's too dangerous --
And the truth frightened her? <+++++> Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them.
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent. <+++++> And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
No. <+++++> If necessary I can bring in the valet parking attendant and two customers who witnessed the occurrence.
Yeah, I been calling in sick. They think I got the flu. <+++++> And a son by your ex-wife? Joseph.
So you want me to tell you the story of my life... <+++++> That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C.
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory? <+++++> I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another. I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
You managed alright. <+++++> Is this what's left of your army?
No? <+++++> No... Cause tonight the girls are here in a more or less professional capacity.
I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden. See the Knicks play. <+++++> New York City?
OK. <+++++> You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
You stupid punk! You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close! ! <+++++> One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
And get on with your job. <+++++> That's right.
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman? <+++++> The Lord will provide.
I wish I knew. You're hiding. <+++++> Hiding what?
Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing? <+++++> Yeah man. I'm jealous. You're always great, Benny. "Her name is G-I-N-A Gina And she lo-oooves me."
A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George. <+++++> It is bad. It's chump change. We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border. We're getting screwed.
What do you mean, 'how did he look'? <+++++> You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties. <+++++> Really?
I think it's a marvelous letter. <+++++> We're a good team.
It's cold out, too, isn't it? <+++++> I'm so hungry.
Talk to him. <+++++> But what do I say?
But it's on the water. <+++++> It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle. It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't... <+++++> He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.
But that group has been, in the main, subdued. Now: How did we come by this information? And. Who subdued that group? <+++++> CAIN LOOKS DOWN AT HER SCRIPT. SHRUGS, AND LOOKS UP.
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an... <+++++> Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
What are you talking about? <+++++> You know. The stuff I left.
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever. <+++++> You better pay the man.
My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'. <+++++> Gesundheit. You don't mind if I stick to George, do you?
Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade. <+++++> You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here. <+++++> But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
What? <+++++> Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower. <+++++> That's right.
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade. <+++++> He still does.
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it. <+++++> I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
I'm not going anywhere. <+++++> You always say that -- then you leave.
Promise me, Benjamin. <+++++> All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
Sure. And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right. <+++++> Yeah, I'm gonna worry about you, too.
You can't love him. <+++++> I don't.
Structure might be salvageable... let's see what the interior looks like. <+++++> Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels. <+++++> Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight.
Are you calling Stan? <+++++> Well... I'm goin' ta bed now.
Keep dreaming. <+++++> Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
Why would he be frightened? <+++++> I don't know. But it was weird in terms of what happened next. Sean was still watching his mother.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week. <+++++> Such as?
Why? <+++++> I just have a feeling. Where are you?
I know- because of our sexual problem, right? <+++++> Hey, you... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?
It's not a charade, all this? <+++++> A charade? How could it be a charade?
Yes? <+++++> You've got a deal.
Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done! <+++++> But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
Not really. <+++++> I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled. Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
You did? <+++++> Yeah. I practically forgot. But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again."
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that! <+++++> Actually, I volunteered.
Is it the frank or the beans? <+++++> I think a little of both.
People lie. That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight. <+++++> I know Risa and Wendell Walker. They wouldn't hire a goddamned lawyer. And the Ottos wouldn't deal
Bud! Where you been the last two days? <+++++> ...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent...
Was I picking on you? How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand? <+++++> Tell the truth, I was going to take a much needed leak.
I happen to be a professional. <+++++> Which street corner?
So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? Y'know, to make it so long? <+++++> I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther.
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it, <+++++> Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job. <+++++> What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it. <+++++> Yes, Mr. Kirkeby. You still owe me for the last two bottles --
The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable. <+++++> Different culture. Hard to penetrate. The Indians don't like white cops poking around.
Nah, they'd shut down the pin number. <+++++> What if--
He's stealing from you, Oskar. <+++++> Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together. What is this?
I don't get it. <+++++> Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself- <+++++> Coffee?
In the brain, I tell you. I know. <+++++> You don't know and you'll never know or understand, Toddy. Not from me or from Knox would you learn those things. Look --
Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman. <+++++> Yeah?
A recoil, with no compensating mechanism. <+++++> And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali? <+++++> Are you a homosexual? Interesting non-sequitur.
What do I want? <+++++> What do you want?
What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude. You said so yourself-- <+++++> No, Walter! I said I thought she kidnapped herself! You're the one who's so fucking certain--
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang? <+++++> Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early. <+++++> The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
Calm down, you're not ... <+++++> Calm down... look at this, look at him...!
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company <+++++> Sorry. It's important.
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU <+++++> Shut UP! The other officers will be here any minute! you're perfectly safe now!
Yes. <+++++> Please join us. Come on forward.
Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'. <+++++> Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.
I don't know. I don't get it. <+++++> Come on. It'll help you get Chris.
So you got a girl? <+++++> Of course.
Me neither. <+++++> I was dead.
 <+++++> Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact.
When? <+++++> Tomorrow night as a matter of fact.
Money, jewels, a very big ball of string... <+++++> Your blood, Max.
Let me have ten bucks? <+++++> Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
The Dancing Dingus! <+++++> The Jerky Circle!
Dad? <+++++> What?
Who might you be, little Miss? <+++++> I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan. At least, I used to.
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it -- <+++++> Handle what?
There's no point both of us getting wet. <+++++> I'm coming with you. Besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back.
And what does he do again? <+++++> He used to work with you. Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife.
Call the police! ! <+++++> Hey buddy... let her go...
Jus' take it slow, buddy. <+++++> What happened? How far did you get?
When? <+++++> Any time. Whenever we want.
I'm Regina Lampert. <+++++> Is there a Mr. Lampert?
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot. <+++++> No, I just happen to take the Captain's advice and look at the bright side of things.
Only two did the shooting. So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation? <+++++> Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza.
Where's Betty? <+++++> She took the night off. Heavy date. Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.
And what is that? <+++++> I am not left-handed.
 <+++++> Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?
What department? <+++++> What do you think, eightball?
No. <+++++> You're calling me on is phone?
Caesar? What is this? <+++++> Ask Johnnie! Ask your rat-fuck son!
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco? <+++++> Just that she got away.
Twenty large? That's all? <+++++> What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
How come you're so brave with all this stuff? <+++++> Tradition. Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries. Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.
Honeymoon! Honeymoon! Say it: Honeymoon! <+++++> It's so--so stark.
Like hell you are. <+++++> Get real. I'm faster than you.
Where did you get that alcohol? <+++++> I packed it. Just for us.
I'll bring him up to your loft. <+++++> I'll see you on the roof.
Hey. <+++++> You ain't the kicker, are you?
Why haven't they killed us! ? <+++++> I don't know!
You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone. <+++++> We are.
I mean your man Trubshaw. Your bullet-proof waistcoat. I thought you were just overdressed. <+++++> I might say the same.
I do. Yes. <+++++> You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
Why don't you like me? <+++++> I do like you, Sheila.
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here -- <+++++> 
Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you? <+++++> I didn't know you could read.
Oh my God. <+++++> Give time, they'll out draw the T-rex. Guarantee it.
What do you mean by sensible? <+++++> It means being without money.
Goddammit, Hap. Think about what you're doing... <+++++> You don't have to be involved, Will.
Your vision? <+++++> Given to me by God. He waits for us on the other side.
So what do we do, General Lee? <+++++> Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they won't care.
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier.... <+++++> I...I can't explain it. It's just something I feel.
Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and -- <+++++> No.
Now momma you have to stay off it, you can't keep go up and down those stairs you have to give it rest. <+++++> Okay
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it? <+++++> Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
But it wasn't supposed to be like this. When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and... <+++++> How? How were we the same people?
Well I'm sorry. Before... <+++++> Mhm.
To what? <+++++> I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
Because I was civil, now you're complaining. <+++++> I can't afford civility, sir. How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing. <+++++> Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street. <+++++> Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
I love him. <+++++> I don't care if you love him! I'm telling you he's no good for you!
Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have. <+++++> Well, I guess that makes you the best. Look, Frank -- she stands to inherit three million dollars.
To Earth. To offer testimony. <+++++> You do this -- for friendship?
He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat? <+++++> It's his way.
Doug? <+++++> Turn around quick!
Are you okay, Violet? <+++++> Mickey, why is Johnnie here? You know how I feel about that fucking psycho.
So how's Tommy? <+++++> They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
I don't know. I don't like it. Christ... <+++++> What?
Huh? <+++++> I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it? <+++++> The Conformist.
What's causing that! ? <+++++> Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name. We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me. <+++++> A complete surprise?
So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants... <+++++> And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
Near the casino. <+++++> In the casino.
Forget it. I was reading. <+++++> I was reading too.
How do you stop The Screamer? <+++++> You can't. He gets you and you're dead. It's like time catching up with you, you know? Like Fate.
Mom? Eve and I have to go. <+++++> What?
It does! <+++++> Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--
Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each... <+++++> A page-break signal. A period.
You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head? <+++++> That's as good a way as any to describe it. I've seen far worse cases.
There is another way. <+++++> Who gets killed?
Really? That's interesting. Not great? <+++++> Oh well, you know.
No sign of the snowman. <+++++> Maybe he melted.
Get water! <+++++> Fix raft first.
I won't be here next week. The tumor's inoperable. I'll be dead. <+++++> I'm already dead.
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up! If you're gonna flip your wig -- <+++++> I can't help it, Suze. It's this place. You know how I get in these stores. They freak me out.
It's ok.I know what you were feeling. <+++++> I can't imagine you crying.
Come on, Terry, we got a ride! <+++++> Jesus, what a rude person...
Already? All these letters? <+++++> Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here. <+++++> Well, maybe we oughta be stuck here. I'm not saying that I know.
Why, Mr. Jason. Most of these books are on the closed shelf. You have to get permission. <+++++> I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor. <+++++> The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything? <+++++> Right. Were going to need some fire power. Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
Where do you keep the can opener? <+++++> In the grub box. Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon.
Do you want the car? <+++++> No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal. <+++++> Geez, I --
"Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?" <+++++> Boy, they totally fell for it! I'm only acting crazy!
You tell me. <+++++> I don't know.
Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP. <+++++> As long as it gets us out of here
Bill Styles... <+++++> Who?
Good for you. <+++++> I haven't been touched in years.
 <+++++> Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
Ebby's told me a lot about you. <+++++> Uh oh...  Can I offer you some coffee?
So you were home last night? <+++++> Yes.
I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster. <+++++> You're slowing.
I just tested for one... <+++++> ...yeah, a month ago.
No, let's go to work. Okay? <+++++> Okay. I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
We're saved! <+++++> What is it?
Yes. So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it. <+++++> Shell Oil?
Why not face up to your lies? It's your lies you can't stand anymore... <+++++> I... I never lied!
Shit. Wrong room. <+++++> What?
Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back. <+++++> Okay.
Oh, Jesus! <+++++> Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother. <+++++> Well, tell, him.
Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand? <+++++> Hugh Kane.
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N. <+++++> I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.
Well, I'll go home with you. <+++++> Oh no, I couldn't do that. Mrs. Swicker would start asking questions. She's my landlady.
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter. <+++++> When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
Is this stool taken? <+++++> No, go--
What are you doing? <+++++> Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
What time do you get finished? <+++++> Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled. <+++++> And now he's addicted to painkillers.
Yeah, you would. <+++++> Well, i-if-if you have some free time...
No. You never worked Berlin. <+++++> My first job.
...try this one out some-... <+++++> ...-time.
Macaulay. <+++++> That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
But you needed a drink first. <+++++> Yes.
Sire. <+++++> Well. There it is.
Maybe we should go in a different room? <+++++> I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
No -- absolutely not -- <+++++> One for all -- all for one --
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak? <+++++> About a year.
Dark haired... <+++++> Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right. <+++++> Of course.
You don't want my autograph. <+++++> Yeah, I do. It's for my girl friend. Make it out to Ralph.
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it. <+++++> No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want. Didn't you read the sign? It says... <+++++> What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she? <+++++> Yes.
Jon -- what? ? <+++++> The south pole. TimeÂ¹s flowing backwards.
Because I'm working the night shift - and I got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there's a lull - <+++++> Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands. <+++++> Why me?
I had an accident. <+++++> I figured that. What kind of accident?
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive. <+++++> Little Red Riding Hood.
She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her. <+++++> You don't like her at all do you?
I am being exploited! Where are you going? <+++++> I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.
More or less. <+++++> Until he gunned down six people.
That's where the popcorn business comes in. You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears. <+++++> Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.
Hey, ever think about retirin'? <+++++> ...No.
What is Treadstone? <+++++> ...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
This is terrific work, if you like rejection. <+++++> I never scared anyone before.
It was quite a page turner. <+++++> Pretty ironic, huh? I had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy... Just to find you.
Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years. Not that I don't miss you. <+++++> Just thought his work should go on.
I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes. How's this sound-- <+++++> Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared. <+++++> I don't think I ever said this to you. But it meant a lot to me the way you were after that Swifty stuff happened.
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay. <+++++> What happened?
I've been ordered into bed. The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment. <+++++> I hope it's nothing serious.
It's my last shot. I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night. <+++++> And I'm supposed to care?
I'll tell you a secret. <+++++> Yes?
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank. <+++++> I wanted to apologize for this morning.
Thank you. <+++++> Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
Feel like pleading for your life? <+++++> Not as much as you feel like hearing it.
How about Noam Chomsky's "Manufacturing Consent?" <+++++> You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books.
Okay...Same as usual... <+++++> Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen. And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa. <+++++> But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse. <+++++> What's the difference?
It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas. <+++++> What are you, an angora wholesaler?
I must know more of you, my son. <+++++> Not a lot ta know.
To old friends. And your new dreams. <+++++> To old friends.
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding? <+++++> Who's Spalding?
Ray. I hate Ian. <+++++> I hate him too. So I just call him "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy."
May I be blunt with you? <+++++> If you must.
What other issue is there, Sid? <+++++> My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing.
It's for working scams against insurance companies. <+++++> And if you do it wrong?
Hey Buddy! Can you let me pull over? Give me some space to pull over. <+++++> Where do you think you're going?
I know this whole thing was my fault. I know it is. <+++++> There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't. <+++++> I wouldn't read too much into it.
It would be an added stress to his heart. <+++++> What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
I've no luck. <+++++> Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again...
You didn't want to farm? <+++++> I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
It's the Queen's decision. <+++++> I beg your pardon? Mama...?
No. <+++++> You promise?
Why what? <+++++> Why you have to go out there.
Get him! <+++++> Talk to him. You speak shellfish! Hey, look... put it in the pot.
He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats? <+++++> I know people.
Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting. Make it look easy. Again! <+++++> Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it. <+++++> Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
Why? <+++++> The last date I had was twenty years ago.
I love you so much. <+++++> I'm not through asking my questions.
What did he say? <+++++> He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.
Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay? <+++++> Okay.
Basically that you're part of the same car pool. <+++++> Anna. Anna. Anna. If that were true, Almond Joy would have handed you your heart right after you handed me the Codex.
I can't say it's a surprise. <+++++> And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box. <+++++> Oh, that would be wonderful!
What room? <+++++> Just drive me around. I want to see if someone's here.
I am calm. <+++++> I got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance --
Who?... Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone. <+++++> You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...
Wait up --  -- just wait up -- <+++++> -- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, I mean give me a fucking break with this, this is --
And you're sure it was a woman? <+++++> God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know.
Wanna another beer? <+++++> Yeah.
You followed me here, didn't you? <+++++> Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling? <+++++> Walter--
Easy, now. <+++++> This is a cinch. I look up, I look down. I look up --
They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner. <+++++> Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
This business is about taking risks. <+++++> Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
You just don't know where, or when, or how. Don't make sense worryin' about the particulars. <+++++> We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride. Is that it?
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane - <+++++> I'll write it myself.
The Milwaukee Brewers? <+++++> Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
You done? <+++++> Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
Because you were afraid to fly. <+++++> Would you stop saying that? I need you to do me a really big favor.
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now. <+++++> It's like "Hi, Mom. I'm not going to be starring in that sitcom and, oh by the way, I'm Goofy.
 <+++++> Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
Do you have coffee? <+++++> In the kitchen.
Let it go, Claude. <+++++> I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress? <+++++> Never before this.
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken. <+++++> I... I don't know...
Yes. Yes, it does. <+++++> 
Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse. I thought I'd take you over. <+++++> Great.
Yes. <+++++> Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
You're sure about this? <+++++> Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him. I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages. <+++++> It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
Does everybody have to hear? <+++++> I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.
You have a stunt bottom? <+++++> I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Oh, hello, Peter. <+++++> You're really good, you know.
Yeah. <+++++> I still am.
Hello there, Picart. <+++++> Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
This is a brutal land. <+++++> You must have known that before you came.
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman. <+++++> I always knew that.
Not that we know of. <+++++> We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
 <+++++> -- That's the general idea.
Where'd he go? I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog. <+++++> He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet.
Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love. <+++++> Why you gotta curse?
Nuisance value? <+++++> They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
No! <+++++> I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!
Really? <+++++> Yes. Under two conditions.
You want to do this yourself? I don't have to do this, you know. <+++++> Be quiet, boy. I'm thinking. It can't be done at the house. It should be . . .
I'll tear his head off. <+++++> Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
Yes. <+++++> Do you walk home?
Sorry. Trade secret. <+++++> Sure. Set me up and then don't tell me.
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us? Fingers rotting off? <+++++> Maybe. But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
Here, are you always this sarky? <+++++> Sarcastic, moi? Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in. It's expected any day now. I'm all packed and ready to go.
Going to make a little stop back home, pick up my shirts, show him a little treat. <+++++> See y'at the Finish Line.
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*! <+++++> It's all very normal.
And now you can? <+++++> Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
Fuck you. You wanted me out. I'm out. <+++++> I'm sorry.
I can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked. If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here. <+++++> A blow dart. Seed pods. A plant press. Pretty unimpressive stuff.
You want to sleep in my bed tonight? <+++++> Okay.
Thanks for everything, Pro. <+++++> Professor Brown grinned. I guess I'll see you in... about 30 years.
Because it's his bad luck to be special. <+++++> He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
You're right, Evan, I don't believe you. <+++++> I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
He doesn1t have fungus, does he? <+++++> I don't think so.
All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack. <+++++> Was that a threat? Did I hear a threat? Last I remember, we were talking economics, then this...?
Is he the only one? <+++++> What do you think?
Oh... Sully. <+++++> Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it?
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well! <+++++> Yes?
That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George. <+++++> I am?
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer <+++++> Thank you for calling Cen -
How was it talking to him? <+++++> Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me.
The perfect couple, I should say. <+++++> You mustn't take it so badly.
Well...no, but -- <+++++> So what makes you so special?
I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too? <+++++> No. Ours was damaged.
Have you warned Professor Hikita? <+++++> First thing I did.
No. No, you go ahead. <+++++> You sure you'll be okay?
Then what? <+++++> I don't know.
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her? <+++++> I did try calling her. A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done? <+++++> I don't know! I just want to get married.
Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date. <+++++> Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again.
Do you understand what I said? <+++++> Yes. Yes. Let me out!
I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this. <+++++> Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
Yes. <+++++> The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you. My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car. <+++++> The _Rolls_?
Let's not get over-dramatic. <+++++> You've really got a low opinion of me, haven't you? We'll I'll give you some pleasant news.
'Sucking off.' <+++++> Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
Would you like to see it? <+++++> I've seen it.
What? How could he have? When? <+++++> I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.
And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk. <+++++> I have a class. I'm late.
I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident -- <+++++> I know.
Go ahead. Take all you want. <+++++> You touch my spleen, Rollo.
He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here. <+++++> Then how do I know this is your office?
All of it. That he tried to rape me. <+++++> Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma! Who's gonna believe that?!
Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over there. <+++++> I won't forget.
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie! <+++++> Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you. <+++++> Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles. You relax up there, ya hear?
YOUNG BLOOD <+++++> I NEED SOME
What are you babbling about, psycho? <+++++> I want to know what's going on. Are you part of this?
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble. <+++++> I have nothing to hide.
Cellar door. <+++++> Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
Not good enough. We still gotta catch Big Geek. <+++++> Not in this thing.
A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right? <+++++> Why? Where are you going?
That means top-secret, Cooper. <+++++> I heard it.
Finish yours? <+++++> Our common heritage. I am your only real friend, you know. The only one who truly understands you.
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife. <+++++> Hello, Hildy!
Just regulation size. We have three like this. <+++++> Three?
No, they-- <+++++> I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool. <+++++> Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time.
In fact the worse things get the better you'll do. It was a "pleasure." <+++++> The contracts? That's the easy part. Finding the money to buy the company, that's hard.
He's directing now. <+++++> They're paying him scale.
I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua. <+++++> What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
Why would they come to me? <+++++> They're going to come to everyone.
Somebody pulled my tail. <+++++> Oh, you did it yourself!
Well, of course, we'd be... honored... <+++++> Just putting in an appearance then.
Thorazin. <+++++> He'll barely be able to sit up.
What? <+++++> The dispensary. I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high. A night at Club meth.
Someone's got to do it, Henryk. <+++++> But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
Kill the bitch. <+++++> Yes, sir.
I always though London was the place to be:  capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth. <+++++> The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
You could have them here by daybreak. <+++++> Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
No, wait! I like your tits. I love your tits. I want to fuck you. <+++++> Good. Now we're getting somewhere. Not a chance.
Just a little nervous, that's all. <+++++> Luther always told me to bite my toenails when I get nervous. You see yourself doin' that and you realize it ain't worth it.
How in the world did he get shot? <+++++> Some guy was drunk and hit him. Accident. Haven almost killed him.
You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing... <+++++> Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
Finish the inscription, idiot! <+++++> Oh.
What? <+++++> They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
Your parents of relation? <+++++> We lived near power lines.
No, you were brilliant <+++++> I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
I don't know. <+++++> You're both full of secrets like Macavity. Did you steal this?
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were youÂÂ <+++++> Why's that?
I'm not a deadbeat. I work when I need to. <+++++> Yeah? And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
See my mother? <+++++> I only had a few hours.
What's the plan? <+++++> Gonna try to get a closer shot of				* Beavis & Butthead. *
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop. <+++++> What are you talking about?
What song? <+++++> "You Send Me."
So? <+++++> I thought she was a killer, too. You know... that she chopped up a bunch of teenage camp counselors... before she was decapitated.
Fireball? <+++++> You're joking.
As a matter of fact I did. They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow. <+++++> Good.
I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn't work. I couldn't buy food. <+++++> I know.
Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little Abyssinian... . <+++++> He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .
Then I'm sure to get a brain -- <+++++> A heart --
Come on! <+++++> All right, I'll try...
No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today. <+++++> Why the change? What about your work?
WE got it back, that's all. <+++++> How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him. <+++++> I hope not. He's already busted the springs in two chairs. Hey, what's this?
I got my own ... <u>quest</u> to pursue up here. It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ... <+++++> Sidetracked? Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
You're bluffing, you bastard! <+++++> That's what you pay to find out. Right, Jack?
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz ! <+++++> It's alright 'cause I got to have you, Johnny...
Just machinery. <+++++> But functioning.
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine. <+++++> No.
No. <+++++> Not now, man, okay, not now. Work with me.
Let's go. <+++++> No.
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this. <+++++> Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.
I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment. <+++++> How charming. But why did he not come himself?
Zack, we've got to go. <+++++> Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push. Fuck you guys!
Is there a connection between them, Alderman? <+++++> Just catch the son of a bitch.
Just says, "I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?" He might *listen* to *you*-- <+++++> Why me?
And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings. <+++++> Well, that was nice of him.
... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out. <+++++> ... Straight out?
I had a witness disappear on me. <+++++> That happens.
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so. And they'll b... <+++++> Give 'em my number.
A ship-wide decompression has been initiated! <+++++> What?
I suppose all this is leading somewhere? <+++++> It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
It's fine. <+++++> You wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes.
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says. <+++++> Like I would have art in my suitcase.
If he had, youÂd be dead. <+++++> So why didnÂt he?
Yeah Vick? <+++++> I want to hear you say it.
Corn gonna shoot at me? <+++++> Nope.
She hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's  little fireman time. <+++++> No way they could have seen it?
Risa, I serviced that bus. At the garage. There's nothing wrong with it. <+++++> ...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
No, it's okay. <+++++> Suit yourself. But I'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell.
It was more than that, I think. <+++++> He was the real thing, right?
Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop. <+++++> He builds models for architects. His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal. Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
There's a piano in the street. <+++++> Yeah.
I... we are humble people... <+++++> Wait, no! Do not be ashamed. The straits of your family need not be permanent.
That means the nanobot is still inside him. <+++++> Yes.
Beautiful but dangerous. Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire. It's 400 years old. <+++++> Exquisite! You said it belongs to...
Monsieur. Quel numero. <+++++> I don't know which numero.
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence. <+++++> Yeah...
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive. <+++++> Sure. Why not.
Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate! <+++++> You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand! Narcissus, the Republic is dead. You think those Senators could govern?
"Hell!" <+++++> No -- neither do I. But...  but this man is a Christian and he has written --
Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops! <+++++> What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
Yes, it is. <+++++> Then... why are you here so often?
 <+++++> Yeah. And?
Many times over the past thirty years. Why he shows himself to me, I don't know but Lasher's not some mindless wraith. <+++++> Then what is he...?
Bruno called. In Europe, people are saying you're gonna die from drugs. They think they can cash in on your death. <+++++> When I was poor, everybody doubted I could make it.
What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then? <+++++> No.
Shut down? <+++++> In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
Whatareyoudoing? ! <+++++> What if he doesn't like me?
I'm not sure this is such a good idea? Do they know you're doing this? <+++++> Oh, yeah, sure -- no. But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
She doesn't know, Mrs. Kane. She just sent it - because I made her see it wouldn't be smart for her not to send it. <+++++> In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman -  is -
You want to do business that way...? Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. What is there on the other list...? <+++++> You want something off the B list?
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox! <+++++> Evelyn, take her to her room!
You're an anomaly in today's world, Max. You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...? <+++++> This? Temporary. To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
Margo hasn't done badly by it. <+++++> Margo. Margo's great. She knows it. That's the trouble.
Hello. <+++++> How do you do.
...How's the paintin' goin'? <+++++> Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
He was at the campground yesterday. <+++++> So...
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...? <+++++> Alexandretta. It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you. Are you acquainted with a David Logan? <+++++> No. Never heard of him.
There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if.. <+++++> I'm not afraid. Are you?
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be? <+++++> You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.
That is why they call it coach? <+++++> Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
ShouldnÂt we grab some dinner first? Maybe a bottle of wine...? <+++++> ItÂs ten thirty, Jack. By eleven youÂre gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off.
She needs you to kill me. She's planned it that way from the start. That's why she phoned me tonight. <+++++> You called him?
Why is that? <+++++> We never would have had this conversation.
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger. I brought you here to warn you. <+++++> Of what?
I don't get it. <+++++> I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something. Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.
Sure you're okay to drive this? <+++++> This rig? Phht. No problem.
You cashed the check? <+++++> Not to my knowledge, no...
Thank you. <+++++> The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show.
Yeah, right. <+++++> If you were tore up I would not be claiming you. Trust.
Who is that! ? <+++++> That's Greene. He's supporting our reconsolidation.
Yeah. Where you headed? <+++++> Work. Going to work.
Hi. <+++++> Irene is going to help.
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER? <+++++> STEPHANIE loved me - she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me - she was just old enough.
What? <+++++> "His greatest greatness."
Simpson. <+++++> Simpson? Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale. <+++++> Hey, Mattie, dig into the morgue and send up all the art you have on Joan Gale.
Don't forget your identity. <+++++> See you next week.
Told him what? <+++++> What I did to Joey.
Where'd they go? <+++++> The happy hunting ground. Who cares?
Where is she? <+++++> Where she lives. In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag. <+++++> The Albacore Club.
Barman -- whiskey --  For you, Mr. Kringelein? <+++++> For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold.
But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew. <+++++> What happened today?
I need to be part of this. <+++++> Absolutely not.
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first? <+++++> All right, I suppose you have the right ta know.
What? <+++++> I'm with Tina. Is she there?
Hungry Hungry Hippos. <+++++> How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed? <+++++> Well... where can we go?
Ellie... <+++++> Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum? We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.
He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify. <+++++> When did he call?
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself! <+++++> Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
I know. I wouldn't know what to say. If it were you. <+++++> We're going to win this.
And that's not the same thing? <+++++> No, but like all novelists, I'm in search of the self.
 <+++++> I can completely understand your distress, sir.
Hardly buried. Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that. <+++++> Well, that kind of security can't be bought. Must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you.
I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back. You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person. <+++++> Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too.
I'd still like to see you. <+++++> Why?
Oh, it was such a big scandal. <+++++> What happened?
The shooter local? <+++++> Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me? ! <+++++> You need a table.
It is? <+++++> After being bombarded endlessly by road- safety propaganda, it's almost a relief to have found myself in-an actual accident.
Yes sir. <+++++> Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
Yeah. <+++++> Come in. Sit down.
They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them. <+++++> What kind of cop were you before this?
... I don't even want to talk about the luau. What's this? <+++++> It's for the bell.
Get to work. <+++++> What'd you rent? Best of Both Worlds?
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later. <+++++> One question. If I'm not myself now, just who do you think I am?
What about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling <u>you</u> how to wr... <+++++> <u>Please</u>...
...Why on earth do the stones interest you? <+++++> Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
Can I carry something for you, to the car? Will you kiss me? <+++++> No. I'm sore.
Hello. <+++++> Listen...
Damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains. It continues, we better stay put. <+++++> It could blow over tomorrow, too.
No, he's really evil. <+++++> Scott.
I know, Dad. I love you too. <+++++> After everything. After everything, the only thing left out of my whole life is you.
 <+++++> You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something. <+++++> She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF. DID YOU HEAR ME? <+++++> Gimme Howie Gold. Howie? Thizz...I neee...I NEED EIGHT HUNDRED GRAND. I...I don't care where it comes from...
Is Tong older than Ming? <+++++> I think Ming is older than Tong. What is this?
No, I'm not. <+++++> You are.
How do you know she did that? <+++++> I was there, I saw her do it.
Sun rises at 5:52. <+++++> I'm not wrecking the transmission!
What can I do for you, Doctor? A research grant? A hospital wing? <+++++> Actually, I already work for you. Or did. Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do? <+++++> Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...
I like you, you know? <+++++> Buzz? What are we doing this for?
Yessir. <+++++> You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib?
I can't leave my job, George. <+++++> Yeah, you can. You could just quit. People do it all the time.
Well, if you put it that way... <+++++> You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
What's going on Terrance? <+++++> Canada is saving us! !
We're going in from the ground floor. <+++++> Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm.
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her. <+++++> He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
These counselor's don't know anything. They're full of shit. If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak. <+++++> I know.
No, he is here. Shit... <+++++> Don't worry about him. Think about yourself.
Oh shut up. All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him. <+++++> Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
It can't be. <+++++> Who is she Daddy?
You're twenty-three years old! <+++++> With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular...
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it... <+++++> Sure, Wichita. Whatever you say...
<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>? <+++++> Lightweight Forward Area air device unit. Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
You think so?...Selina? <+++++> You've seen me...
Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --? <+++++> No.
I'm an orphan. <+++++> Well, then, you're a lucky girl, cause that baby's gone to be your family. ...I've got an appointment....
Er, would you, er, would you like to make some money? <+++++> Yeah, maybe.
Two of 'em? <+++++> Thass' right. I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
Nineteen. <+++++> You're not taking real good care of yourself.
Hello? <+++++> Yes.
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers? You are in my domain! <+++++> Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader?
We should tell him we're not going. <+++++> Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on."
Second generation, huh? <+++++> Third. Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White. I come from a picture family.
Uh...yes, at the moment. <+++++> Great. Gotta go. See you then.
From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects. <+++++> Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe? <+++++> Why do you say that?
Rennie...what'd they do to you? ? <+++++> Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates. But we held strong. <+++++> How do they know it's over?
There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will? <+++++> I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
I can't take her with me. <+++++> Nobody asked you to.
Hands and knees, you say? <+++++> And terror, if you don't mind.
Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done. <+++++> Shit!
Why didn't you let us know what was happening, son? <+++++> Sorry, Em, I wanted it to be like... a big surprise for you and pee.
Jesus Christ. Did you have to be so rough on her? <+++++> Do you want the kid or don't you?
I don't... I... I can't remember... <+++++> Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy! <+++++> I-I-I...
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name? <+++++> Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
I'm not tired! <+++++> I'm sure you're not.
Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter. I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through. <+++++> Fine.
Are you afraid for me? Where I'm going. <+++++> Yes.
I think I know exactly what you mean. <+++++> You do?
I was trying to find the right time. <+++++> After I left?
No... <+++++> Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters.
An accident at the mill? <+++++> No -- it's about Mrs. Holland. A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there. <+++++> We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
But what if they try and scare us? <+++++> We'll scare 'em right back.
Enough, Liz. <+++++> Enough of what?
Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could. <+++++> Some Hallowe'en goin' on outside. The whole police force standing on it's ear.
Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you. <+++++> No.
Damn it, Grace! Tell him. <+++++> If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself. <+++++> What?
Still time. <+++++> Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him. <+++++> Hush.
Today. <+++++> I'm sorry. I don't have anything for at least a month.
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now? <+++++> I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am.
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you? <+++++> I made you write a beautiful song...
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me. <+++++> Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
Nineteen-sixty-seven. <+++++> Running time?
Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway. <+++++> So why didn't we?
I only got... <+++++> Just do it!
A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds. That would include myself and an assistant. <+++++> And what would you do?
He has lots of disks. <+++++> I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office. Could you find them and see who they belong to?
Today. <+++++> Oh, Jesus, Get me a 12-lead e.k.g. and start an i.v. stat! This man is having a heart attack.
No. I couldn't see. <+++++> Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a minute, would you? They look worried.
You bet I wouldn't. <+++++> Not with all your money!
Of course. I was going to be James Bond. <+++++> Ahhhh...
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got. <+++++> That'll be interesting.
That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected. <+++++> I called because I just want... I need to talk.
You're talking the whole FBI here. A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country? <+++++> There's a word - orders.
My God you look exactly like him. <+++++> I never knew my father. Did you?
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way? <+++++> You bitch!
I'm staying. <+++++> If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
I told you it wasn't no jive. <+++++> Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking "get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it.
Can I stay, sir? I'm willing to risk it. I am. After what we just witnessed. <+++++> What? No, I know they're civilians...
What do you want? <+++++> Don't be so upset. It's OK...
She brings you food, she rubs your back... Didn't I see her change your tire one day? <+++++> I jacked the car up. All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on.
Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little disaster didn't ya fella. <+++++> Yeah ... Sort of ...
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe? <+++++> It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
You ok? <+++++> Just thinking about something.
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret. Now that's all I have. <+++++> Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious. We want to produce your play. I have the contracts right here. <+++++> Oh joy of joys! Oh, dream of dreams! I can't believe it. Birds, birds, do you hear?
You coming in? <+++++> No, I'mma go on to work. I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth. Now listen to me, Craig.
ItÃ­s all right, Ethan..youÃ­ll bring me back...wonÃ­t you... <+++++> I always have, Claire..
Ta. <+++++> I'll bet this one's seen some action.
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men-- <+++++> --Haldeman I know, who else?
Not exactly. <+++++> Not exactly? But close enough, eh? So he saved your life, then?
Who're you kidding? You can so. <+++++> Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
Unfinished business. <+++++> And what about the reconfiguration?
He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy. <+++++> I'll bet.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges... <+++++> Enough. I've got to use the phone.
Yes. <+++++> Why'd ya quit?
Getting high, I guess. <+++++> If I asked you to stop, would you?
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen. <+++++> Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
I didn't say you were scared. <+++++> I know.
He wasn't even in the car? <+++++> Aslan, there...
What time is it? <+++++> Seven-thirty.
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you? <+++++> Trans Ocean Travel.
So you found Peter... <+++++> I think we sort of found each other.
... Made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back... cut him loose. <+++++> MacReady...?
Oh, what's that? <+++++> Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
Got a cigarette? <+++++> Sure...
Yes. <+++++> Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
Haven't you noticed I didn't mention Michelle once today? <+++++> I didn't want to say anything.
Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods. <+++++> Oh, yeah.
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..." <+++++> Oh, no...
Your name's Carpenter -- that right? Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number? <+++++> No -- I'm afraid not.
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens. <+++++> So?
What exactly does that mean? <+++++> It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes then someone else did.
They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon. <+++++> I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.
What's the matter? <+++++> Nothin--  --I just remembered the name of a guy that owes me fifty bucks.
Oh. <+++++> It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story.
You must take me for a real idiot. <+++++> I don't.
I thought you weren't dying. <+++++> I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up. <+++++> Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben. Thank you. So let's just go to this fiasco if that's what you want to do.
Good morning, Lovey. <+++++> I beg your pardon.
Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office. <+++++> Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl. <+++++> I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
Great. Terrific. Glad you could make it. <+++++> How we doing?
I'm now begging you. <+++++> Listen, since I got you on the phone -- ask the guys there if they wanna chip in for a hooker.
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving. <+++++> And yours.
Oh -- yes but -- later. <+++++> Why later?
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning. <+++++> That you?
I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her. <+++++> Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
I was on a roll! IÂm a little overextended now. <+++++> Oh Jesus Christ...
Okay? <+++++> Unbelievably handsome. You look fantastic in a suit.
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with? <+++++> The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation.
This is your bedroom? <+++++> No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
Where are you from originally, Annie? <+++++> San Francisco.
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining... <+++++> He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
What do you mean? You don't even know me. <+++++> Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house. <+++++> Yeah, that's true.
Uh-huh. <+++++> I'm crucifying him.
Kaboom. <+++++> Again?! Jesus!
Max? What are you doing? <+++++> Leave me alone.
What'd I say? <+++++> Nothing.
Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now. <+++++> Michael - you loved that house as a child. You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror.
Uh, you first. <+++++> C'mon, Beavis, just start running really fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.
Hi. <+++++> Hi.
Look Pakeesa... <+++++> Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
Eight units. Mountain View. <+++++> You did that?
Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed. <+++++> I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good. <+++++> But you've got to listen to me.
Yes, sir. <+++++> Mine too?
Sure. <+++++> I'll be down in a minute
Go away. I might hurt you. <+++++> I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off. <+++++> What's happened?
Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different. <+++++> No! No different! The differences are in your mind. Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
You need to leave. <+++++> I know everything about you, Diana.
I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals. <+++++> Well, we have plenty of those. Right over here. We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...? <+++++> Lowell?
So, what's your point? <+++++> Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
This is the end of it, Sam. I'm gonna build something of me here that I can be proud to give to you. <+++++> Don't. I don't want it.
Jesus... go ahead. <+++++> Thanks, young man. You've got a heart of gold.
They said. <+++++> Hmm.
Hold on -- <+++++> Maybe older --
I didn't ask for a dog. <+++++> ...the pet wrangler suggested it..he's also got a...
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter? <+++++> He'll be there at 8:30.
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message? <+++++> I just got in.
Esdras is a Jew. <+++++> So was Christ!
Well, you the one in motherfuckin' charge. <+++++> Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'
It was there. This angry music all by itself. And I heard whispering. <+++++> What kind of whispering?
Who do we interface with on their side? <+++++> What do you mean?
He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry. <+++++> Don't watch. I can't if you watch.
You all put together? <+++++> My back's open. Did the extra help get here?
Why, no . . . Don't be silly. <+++++> Oh, please, DadÂ
You're kidding. <+++++> Unfortunately, no.
Chi? <+++++> Roberto. Who owns the 'rat-holes.'
No more than the usual. <+++++> The usual...
Somebody hit you? <+++++> It's not what you think.
He's got you believing in Zero now too. <+++++> I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
Chain saws. <+++++> You want to put in chain saws?
Hi, it's me... <+++++> Oh, hi...
Anna. <+++++> Anna who? Anna Green Gables? Anna Conda?
You can ask me anything. <+++++> Have you ever heard of someone named Lisa Sherman?
He'll say that? <+++++> Yeah.
You all right, Professor Tripp? <+++++> He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
...If that's the way you wanna put it. <+++++> I don't have some way to put it. That's the way it is.
A clinging possessive mother. Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all. <+++++> Then what was it?
You all right? <+++++> Sure...
There's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one. The city of the dead. <+++++> Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us? Fingers rotting off?
Yeah, that's what happened with me too. <+++++> The other guy drew first.
What's this? <+++++> That's my diet shit.
But this time I want you to make one small adjustment. <+++++> What's that?
...It's kind of a pro bono job. <+++++> 'Pro bono'. That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
This is us. Bank Robbery. And you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world-- <+++++> 1322 last year in LA county. Up 26 percent from the year before.
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage! <+++++> Thank you.
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives. <+++++> He hardly knew of them him- self. I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car. <+++++> There's no scar. Corvis made it up.
Who? <+++++> Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like? <+++++> Good fighters.
It's not here. Let's go. <+++++> You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
Target disruptors. Destroy them. <+++++> Disruptors are off-line, sir.
Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either. <+++++> The material world is an illusion. It doesn't matter if they're there or not. The world is in my head.
You can do it in my mouth. <+++++> Don't you understand anything?
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?' <+++++> What?
You're somewhere else, where? <+++++> Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
Then we'll do something else. <+++++> What else?
Perhaps not. Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex. <+++++> Really? And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
And you believed him? <+++++> I saw it with my own fucking eyes! See, that's his best trick. No illusions. Just the truth. Are you ready for that?
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place? <+++++> You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.
On what. <+++++> How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky. <+++++> Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
Ok.  Chinese. We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish. <+++++> Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena. <+++++> My mother has always loved me. She would do anything for me.
I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls. <+++++> Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart. Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
Like it? <+++++> Smart. London, eh?
Come on, Mom. We're gonna miss all the fun stuff! <+++++> Danny, you're just going to have to wait!
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit? <+++++> No sir but you struck me as a man who wouldn't want to waste a chair. I remember dates. Names. Numbers.
He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A. Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops! His radiation does just quadrupled. <+++++> Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
What? <+++++> Negative thinking makes everything more difficult. If you're going to have enough strength to do this, we have to talk only about positive things.
Good one. <+++++> Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.
Of course. <+++++> And?
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman? <+++++> The theatres are all closed by the plague!
Why a beret? <+++++> Cause you can crush it and put it in your pocket.
Juliet who? <+++++> In the play. She was married, by my age. And Mummy. Mummy wasn't much older than me when she got married.
Could be a big one comin' any minute now... <+++++> Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
You old-fashioned? <+++++> Must be.
I'm getting that way, too. <+++++> Have you ever gone with anyone who--
Ivory. <+++++> Looks old.
What about Picard? <+++++> Our greater goal is more important, brother.
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy? <+++++> No, this is my first trip, Doc.
Where the hell are you? <+++++> Right here. At the door.
Ross. <+++++> Ross. Real pleased to meet you. I'm Erin.
I am not forgetting your last brief chat. <+++++> Just go. We can manage without you.
What's it all about? <+++++> What?
These we'll pay for. <+++++> Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help. <+++++> No. He can't...
When? <+++++> Fall, six months at the earliest.
But she mentioned Beaumont by name? <+++++> Uh-huh.
That's my girl. <+++++> But I want to make some changes. Get Krista in here right away won't you?
My name is Ronald Brean. <+++++> Who're you working for?
I don't know. Tastes okay to me. Hey, they got a reserve pinot. <+++++> Let me use your phone.
Even there? <+++++> It would feel so yummy.
Yes? <+++++> <u>This is all your fault</u>!! !
Shrink, actually. <+++++> Crikey.
No. <+++++> Really? What would it take?
I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified. I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done. <+++++> Do you, indeed. I'll bet you do. Fine. Fine. We'll save the court the time.
OhÂwhat have I done? <+++++> He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
She's talking to him now. <+++++> We paid him a million dollars. You'd think he'd want to cooperate a little, help our ratings.
An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember? <+++++> It was hard to have him killed.
I'm gay. Like you didn't know. <+++++> Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear? <+++++> I'm impressed. You're a killer.
We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help. <+++++> You were not coming here, to see me?
Sure, that would be cool. Friends. <+++++> Okay. See you later, friend.
Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot. <+++++> She's pretty cute.
The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey. <+++++> You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out. <+++++> How long till the room fills ?
I don't know what else to do. <+++++> Help me.
So I follow the wires? <+++++> You get Hardy.
Maybe not...but maybe it does. If no one told me about this, I mean...maybe they're trying to hide something. <+++++> Like what?
You talked to him? <+++++> In the trunk, yeah?
Sir? <+++++> The presidency won't protect us, Bob. We're beyond politics now ...
To the bed. <+++++> Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed.
You better quit that. <+++++> But Rose...
Did you see that sucker burn? ! <+++++> Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul. <+++++> We all agree with the doctor, Dear. He thinks it's safer for you to stay here for a while.
But you can t stay, you know that? <+++++> Didn't think I could.
What? <+++++> The mirror. You can't see yourself in it.
You coming tonight? <+++++> Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know. Now that's poor taste.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth? <+++++> I mean it, there is only three of us here.
Oh, George ... <+++++> But your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.
Won't your father help you with that? <+++++> Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...? <+++++> Oh, man, there you go again.
You know, I just can't do that anymore. I still have time to get things right. Get married again -- <+++++> You mean us?
Eddie, you're too smart for your own britches. Listen to me. How much do you want to run to the store for Da Mayor? <+++++> Fifty cents.
For what? <+++++> It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
Oh, uh-huh. <+++++> Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
Peace. <+++++> All right.
Don't think I won't. <+++++> Do it! Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore. You think it's so easy?
Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead. <+++++> Eighteen and a half years.
Bob, that makes no sense. <+++++> Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
I've never fired anyone in my life. <+++++> I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it? <+++++> You ort not to pull on yourself that away.
You got to tell em that you saw the accident. Don't you? <+++++> I can't do that.
There you are! <+++++> This doesn't obligate me in any way.
Just a second, Mr. President. <+++++> Will somebody find out what's going on? !
Oh Jesus Jesus... <+++++> He will know everything about you. Everything. I know, because I've done it.
I made it go down the toilet. <+++++> What?
What? <+++++> 
We were expecting you to return by six. <+++++> And now I am back.
You're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance, are you? <+++++> Sean, please..
It's the President's personal property! I will never give up my tapes to a bunch of Kennedy-loving Harvard Democrat cocksuckers! <+++++> This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
Wow. You look beautiful. <+++++> Yeah. Most important day of my life. Whatever.
Do you really think Billy did it? <+++++> He was there, Tatum.
Jesus, Jane. How long have you been here? <+++++> A long time. I was restless. Will you crack my neck?
The damn lock's broken again. And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game? <+++++> I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
Do you see any family resemblance here? <+++++> You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
Are you even really alive? <+++++> My problem, Mr. Case, is simply that I am a soulless bastard.
I'm not going, Janet. <+++++> What are you trying to do? Make Bert look like a fool? He's made all the arrangements.
Excuse me -- Theresa, was it? There are no holes in my research. <+++++> No offense. There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask.
Home--where he lives. <+++++> And are the police sure about that?
The Creator is that which created V'ger. <+++++> Who is V'ger?
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart. <+++++> Oh, sure!
I treated you like a son or nephew. <+++++> It's not <u>you</u>, it's...
You think so? Do you really? <+++++> We're going to take them to the airport.
Is there an antidote? <+++++> Like if you shoot yourself in the foot? Wouldn't matter. You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.
I know. I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember? <+++++> You never said anything. About the drapes.
Good evening, Mr. Blank. <+++++> How are you? How's business?
No! Get me out! <+++++> This is too big for even you. Where is it?
This is the situation. Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215. <+++++> B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
Not sometimes. Always. Just because it is the hard way. You're that kind of man, Jeff. <+++++> Goodbye, Betty.
Is that better? <+++++> Perfect, Mr. President.
She's amazing. She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you. <+++++> Wait, wait. You told her about me?
Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable. I am a fan. <+++++> Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
Who killed Caesar? Twenty, twenty-five Senators. All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA... <+++++> This is Louisiana, chief. How the hell do you know who your daddy is?
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away! <+++++> No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
...But I guess you don't really know him any better than that board does, do ya, Miss Archuh? <+++++> Well, maybe I --
You were the snake! Right? I know. I saw you. <+++++> You've <u>got</u> to say it!
I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me? <+++++> Father, I wasn't disputing you.
'Big'? <+++++> You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.
Go ahead... third time's a charm. <+++++> <u>Betelgeuse</u>!
Why did you call me? The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you. <+++++> Gosh. Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
You can't, it's too dangerous. <+++++> I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
I get the idea. You got a description? <+++++> Of his penis, sir?
So what are you guys doing this Summer? <+++++> Nothing.
Man this is heavy! <+++++> Yeah what's this, Murdered Elephant?
I have no idea - it's full of files and documents and tapes. <+++++> Do you know what this means?
God damn son of a... <+++++> Isn't that a daisy?
Oh, a little savage, is he? <+++++> A proper Aborigine.
Sweet Grace? What about her? <+++++> About what you said this morning.
You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you. <+++++> What're you talking about?
No, sir? <+++++> My change.
Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there...inside. <+++++> What does that mean?
Any more announcements? <+++++> Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.
What're you crazy? <+++++> I like my job.
Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside. <+++++> Oh I been out.
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it. <+++++> Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ? <+++++> Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine.
Follow orders. Do whatever they say. <+++++> Who's "they"?
And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus. My friends call me Josie. <+++++> Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie.
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress? <+++++> I dyed one and washed the other.
Fine. <+++++> I've also drafted a letter to families of officers killed in the line of duty. They'll need your signature.
You're ruthless. <+++++> You're not so bad yourself.
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis. <+++++> Sure. And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone. Nearly snapped me in half.
New information. <+++++> Ever see one of these before?
-- But he was concerned about the timing? <+++++> The timing -- yes. He says it's up to Joe.
He had his palm print on the weapon. <+++++> It went to the goddamn FBI and they didn't find a goddamn thing.
 <+++++> Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music. Those ingrates really take a bite.
Hey Daniel! Hello? Do you guys speak English? <+++++> Uh, yeah.
Sounds familiar. <+++++> It should. You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.
Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However... <+++++> Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it, you'll see. Julian is a gentleman.
Not bad for government work. Having a good time. <+++++> Haven't had so much fun since Live TV.
And second? <+++++> Mmmmmm.
As I was saying:  I'm a woman, and can't be taken for granted. Are you listening, you Batman you? <+++++> Hanging on every word.
Wanna kiss me, Jim? <+++++> Yes I do.
I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson. <+++++> I know what you've been doing.
You don't want any water? <+++++> No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently? <+++++> I've been trying to finish a book...
I bet your parents were happy to pay. <+++++> I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
You've heard of the National Security Agency? <+++++> What do they have to do with this?
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room. <+++++> It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
Daddy, what's the matter? <+++++> She's got somebody in there, Brother! His shoes are on the back porch -- there they were, naked and smiling at me!
Well, how did it go?. What happened? <+++++> Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
No shooting. <+++++> Move in, guys.
...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner... <+++++> ...shivering...
-- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind! <+++++> But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
You haven't changed a bit. Always so sure of yourself. Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you. <+++++> Is that so bad?
Do you remember who gave us this? <+++++> No.
I don't mean to cry, I'm sorry. <+++++> It's okay, Stanley. It's alright.
Nobody even asked me if I like her. If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh... <+++++> Daddy and I tried hard. We really did.
Jim, this is garbage. This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about. None of it. You can't-- <+++++> That's my decision, Ted and that's final.
Nothing. <+++++> What'd I say?
"There is a justice higher than that of man. I will be judged by Him." <+++++> What?
This ice will break yet. How's our guest? <+++++> He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil. Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
Because His Majesty wishes it. <+++++> Is the Emperor angry with me?
No. <+++++> Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
A dog at Victoria's Secret? <+++++> No, it was another woman.
Why? Why would Johnnie do this? <+++++> Jesus Christ, Violet! Open your fucking eyes! Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out? Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people? <+++++> Materials. Nothing more.
Spooning, fooling around, God knows what. You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand -- <+++++> I picked you for your verve, your excellence, and for your ability to - how shall I say - instruct. You've lived a first-rate life.
Fuck, what the fuck is going on -- <+++++> What do we do?
He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die. <+++++> Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.
I called. You weren't there. <+++++> I got bored so I went to the movies.
I wonder if that's his doctor. <+++++> Only one way to find out.
Yeah. But not any more. <+++++> Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
You were there, Frank! Where, according to St. Dallas, J.J. was responsible for the Elwell smear! <+++++> Don't go wild, Sidney.
Without calling me? <+++++> In a hurry.
007, I'd like to see you in my office. Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information? <+++++> Yes, M.
You on some kind of work plan? <+++++> You mean like benefits?
And I bet you say that to all the girls -- <+++++> No, no.
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away. <+++++> I know... But you do look so silly.
I don't see anybody in there but you. <+++++> I would appreciate a little space. Thank you.
Where? <+++++> Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO!
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive. And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens... <+++++> There are reasons for the way we do things here.
I saw your face. You knew that place. You knew those people. <+++++> That's the past. It's dead.
How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now. <+++++> Naw, it's... I mean...
Daddy, no! <+++++> Just for a minute
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's. <+++++> Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right. <+++++> Thank you.
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me. <+++++> Do you know who that is?
Sir, may I go first? ? <+++++> Not so fast. He barely knows him --
The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow. <+++++> Quite so. Quite so. And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
I'm falling apart, that's funny? <+++++> You just -- just -- what happened, you just had a little rest stop wasn't on the schedule.
Well she better -- she's engaged to one. <u>Me</u>! <+++++> Engaged? As in you're getting married?
All part of the Service we Render. <+++++> He ain't seen <u>nothin'</u> yet.
Nice speech. I thought it was ÂtouchingÂ... and Âfunny.Â <+++++> Thank you.
In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon. <+++++> Where is this...thing?
Lose the earring, Michael. It's not happening. It's just not happening. <+++++> Piss off.
Who is it? <+++++> Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
Shock trauma. She's going to need years of therapy after this. My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man? <+++++> She thought it was me.
President's speech. <+++++> At the Airport? Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...
Oh. Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I? <+++++> Not at all. You have your life. And I have mine.
I don't get it. <+++++> You have to go to her, Jonah. You have to find her.
Too deep to anchor out there. <+++++> Looks like it's adrift.
What? <+++++> That.
Who do you think could've done this? <+++++> I'll ask the questions, son.
That will mean another interview, won't it? <+++++> No, this is quite final. You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter. He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.
How much is it? <+++++> How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
Uh... Is this the right bus? <+++++> You mean there's mre than one?
I've been ok. <+++++> Good. How's your mom?
Oh, I see, I see. <+++++> You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-
There was talk of a file photo. <+++++> In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
A madman. <+++++> A madman. Perhaps he was. What kind of madman? Don't think! Answer.
Doesn't sounds like him. <+++++> Miss Sherman, he's asking you back, but it's entirely your choice.
The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule? <+++++> Take note Mr. Mason...this is why you hire a professional...No whining. No excuses.
I've got hunch. I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed. <+++++> Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time. <+++++> What happened to you?
Book code? <+++++> 'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?
'Bout five thousand. <+++++> How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on. <+++++> OK. But do me one last favor, will you. Can you give me two hours?
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand. <+++++> Not quite -- it seems. Goodbye, Jeff.
If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein. <+++++> The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
Because... because... Listen Edie, don't get sore nowÂ but I think we're getting in love with each other. <+++++> I can't let myself fall in love with you.
Never had to. <+++++> I'm a ballplayer. If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market. <+++++> Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
I wish you'd quit that bartending job. <+++++> Why?
Don't put yourself out. <+++++> Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Doolittle! Help me. <+++++> Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
What do you think? It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you? <+++++> Yes, I did.
What? <+++++> I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better... <+++++> ...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column... <+++++> Are you finished?
If we could cast it properly, that is... <+++++> Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight. <+++++> No rawness.
No, Holiness. <+++++> Am I running away?
The eight billion. From them to us. <+++++> Right. The eight billion.
Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am. <+++++> And the underground garage one. Would I know him?
Clean? <+++++> More or less.
What is it? <+++++> I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
Not too late. <+++++> Four-thirty in the morning?
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l? <+++++> I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
Hopefully no one. <+++++> No one? Then why is Zero here?
Government business? <+++++> Very official. 259-7881, if I recall.
Is there an ashtray in here? <+++++> No.
For being a bootlegger? <+++++> For being a man.
Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret. <+++++> The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
Yes, I thought that it would be best. <+++++> Even in the bathroom?
When are you going back? <+++++> I don't know. Sometime. Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
Probably no longer than four weeks. <+++++> A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?
Is it dark? <+++++> It's kind of a sports bar
Oak? <+++++> No. What's it doing here in the middle of the foundation?
Is he a Nazi? <+++++> I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge. It's red hot. <+++++> 
I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people. <+++++> What do you read? What's the last book you read?
Show a little respect, Nero. The man was an important artist. <+++++> Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.
Which one would you like to join, Luthor? Pick a hole. <+++++> Wait a minute, wait a minute, let's talk a deal, Superman. We can take a lunch on this --
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling. <+++++> Who's now vanished.
Soon. <+++++> Yep.
Not embarrassed. <+++++> Ashamed.
That's a word you're too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that ... <+++++> Helps sometimes to say it.
No more fuckin' for her. <+++++> Smurfette doesn't fuck.
AND DID YOU? <+++++> IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
The hell is that? What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her? <+++++> Buttholus extremus. But hey, you're making progress.
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get. <+++++> You've got to help around the house!
It worked before... <+++++> The scent won't last...
No ma! No! <+++++> BLAME...
From who? <+++++> Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay.
In radio we're different. <+++++> I bet. Thanks for the drink.
By the way, I'm not much of a pool player. <+++++> Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know.
...That's fine. <+++++> Have you read the Bible, Garland?
I know of no better time. <+++++> You can't be serious. It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.
Why? <+++++> Fire.
Isn't there anything I can say That'll change your mind? You're Gonna stay with your new friends? <+++++> 'Least they don't scare women.
Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom? <+++++> 'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer... <+++++> Do you think that's what he wants?
Sorry, y'all. My bad. <+++++> Shorty, why don't you say grace?
What happened? <+++++> That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
For what!? ! <+++++> Your pleasures of course!
The hell you don't. <+++++> Five million?
Of course, sir. <+++++> Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't. The situation is critical right now.
 <+++++> I'm going to work in the garden.
That's right. Layaway. Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate. <+++++> Who's the cheapskate?
A dime. <+++++> One hundred thousand? That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
Really. How'd it go? <+++++> She held up very well.
Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout... <+++++> No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am sorry. Sorry to have wasted your time with such...
It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think? <+++++> I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right? <+++++> The left. It's more natural. Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb. What would that be made of?
Are you shitting me? <+++++> I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month.
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better. <+++++> I beg your pardon?
Their com system must still be down. <+++++> Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help.
He'll give the better mark. I am not afraid of him. <+++++> In faith, I believe you are not; for a lad I never saw more game in my life. Give me a kiss, my dear boy.
He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun! <+++++> I'm so happy for you!
Oh splendid. Well done. How's the pay in movies? I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid? <+++++> Fifteen million dollars.
How'd you get this number? <+++++> Who was it answered the phone?
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch. <+++++> Look.
I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall. Do you know a man called Albert Swift? <+++++> Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
Hi, this is Julia. Please leave a message after the tone. <+++++> Hey, Ma, it's me. Checking in. Probably at work. Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow night. Love you.
And why am I here? <+++++> To help me.
Unh, unh. <+++++> When you think about them... the money... the key ... does it make you remember anything?
I'm here for the week. <+++++> Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'. <+++++> Sure. We aim to.
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it! <+++++> Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad. <+++++> It's not good...
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government. <+++++> No. I shall be out walking.
Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say. <+++++> And who ... would you say this <u>to</u>?
 <+++++> I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...
He_s the closest we've got to an intellectual. <+++++> What's that? A Democrat with an attitude!
What? <+++++> Smile.
What's this? <+++++> The address of the Russian production company. Just in case we need to find them.
What? <+++++> Goodnight!
Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question? <+++++> Shoot.
What for, Sheriff? <+++++> We have a warrant. To search your boat.
What'd it say? <+++++> 'Yes'.
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa. <+++++> I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
No. I just wanted you to -- <+++++> You did the right thing, Daniel. Let's stay in touch, okay? Good night.
<u>So what are we doing</u>? <+++++> Go back to the hotel.
You could do it yourself... <+++++> No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
But what do they want? Where are we going? <+++++> She's got nothing to do with this. Let her go.
The nerve centers -- the brain -- <+++++> But what makes a thought start?
I thought you moved out. <+++++> Well . . . I moved back in. My lawyer said it would give me a better claim on the house in the property settlement.
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't. <+++++> I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
Get real. <+++++> Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
What the fuck? <+++++> Brimmer! Could you come in here please?
...her face is careworn. <+++++> Yes...That's Aunt Em.
The developing room. I need to... see you. <+++++> I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
Oh my God. <+++++> Could I have a tissue please?
Afraid ... of what? <+++++> -- of what happens after we die!
When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle? <+++++> Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
Hello, Harry. <+++++> Juno. I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
and a double for you and Charlie here. And put it on my tab, willya? <+++++> Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
Ha. He was building his fucking porch. <+++++> Building his porch!
What did you say... ? <+++++> What is wrong with you?
I hope so. But that's up to the guy upstairs. Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing? <+++++> Roy?
I'm educating myself! <+++++> You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
Really? But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence! <+++++> I'll protect you, Dollface.
Good to meet you. Again. <+++++> Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ... <+++++> No harm done. Everything's okay now. I've got to be going.
I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't. <+++++> Okay, we won't. We'll just have fun, all agreed?
I did. <+++++> A single hour.
I do. <+++++> Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town.
Could you slow down a little? Or we could wait for the car... <+++++> No cars. Feet are faster.
Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten. <+++++> Guaranteed, eh?
Where at? <+++++> Susanville.
Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon? <+++++> Jesus... this is inhuman. Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
You can turn everything around so easily. This is not just another game, is it? <+++++> No.
I won't. And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either. <+++++> 
Leave now. <+++++> Oh, grow up.
Fron kon steen! <+++++> My name is Gerhart Falkstein.
You're really pure, you know? You got a perfect record. You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now? <+++++> 
No. <+++++> Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
What? <+++++> Gray -- I'm rid of him --
So-so, Johnny. <+++++> Don't hit me, now, don't hit me!
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great. <+++++> I wonder sometimes.
I'm busy, man. <+++++> If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date. <+++++> Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
You're an enthusiast. <+++++> Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
How'd I look? <+++++> Enh.
Why are you carrying the dog? <+++++> His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
What about it? <+++++> There's something black in the green part of your eye.
Jack Manfred. <+++++> Hi, Jack. Welcome to the cesspit.
Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park. <+++++> The park dude was missing an arm.
Dodge. Dodge. <+++++> What?
Are you okay? <+++++> Peachy! Why shouldn't I be?
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree? <+++++> Leave the tree.
You gave it your best shot. You tried. <+++++> We lost him?...
I'm okay here. Why bother? <+++++> No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
What do you think I'm doing? I'm on my way to the school like you wanted. <+++++> Forget about us. Just save Rachel.
Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind. <+++++> You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.
Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap? <+++++> You're getting out of the business?
I said I didn't want to do the sketch. <+++++> GET OFF!
Name? <+++++> I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am!
I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes. <+++++> What do you want?
Yes you are. I'm not just some reporter. I don't just stick a microphone in your face. You could give me something. <+++++> Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence. That was...
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one. <+++++> Good God almighty. This is a catastrophe, they won't hire her.
...Who is this? <+++++> Chet!
To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem. And I don't like problems. <+++++> With all respect, Padrino. Diego is my partner. I do not do business without him.
That's why I'm here. I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell. <+++++> What I saw?
Sorry about all that...I'm your CIT-- Jasper. <+++++> When all else fails, Jasper--Gum. Even now in these troubled times,                           ] every child's drug of choice.                               ]
Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13. <+++++> I don't know.
Eleven and a half. <+++++> Oh, God. Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?
I'll have a decision by next week. <+++++> It's gone on long enough. You're out.
You're kidding? My God. What is it? <+++++> It's chinchilla.
It will take them five minutes! How long ago did they arrive? <+++++> I don't know... Five minutes.
I can't believe you did that. <+++++> I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
Well, guess I don't even need to be here... <+++++> Get your dick back here. It has everything to do with you.
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck. Was will dien tachlas von Dir? <+++++> You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick. Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that. <+++++> Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
What do we do? <+++++> We keep going, that's what we do. We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
You held onto this all that time? <+++++> Well, I...I know it's a little strange, but...I thought it might come in handy if I...needed a scarf someday.
Very impressive. <+++++> We have tapes in here that go back six months. Let me show you something.
And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday. He's proud of the man you are tonight. That's what counts. <+++++> To my father. Everything counts.
What were you thinking? <+++++> Yum, yum.
You wouldn't. <+++++> Of course I wouldn't.
How are you doing? <+++++> Okay.
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she? <+++++> I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
Jeffrey? Why? <+++++> I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
Already working on it. <+++++> Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.
Something was just missing. <+++++> What?
Okay, good reason. Then what? <+++++> It was alright for a while, you know. But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
Perhaps it was the smoke. <+++++> Not her brand.
Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying. <+++++> I get the picture.
Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me? <+++++> Sure.
It's those rocks, up there. <+++++> You and Suzie used to come out here together?
Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders. <+++++> Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
You all right? <+++++> No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead. Oh no... I ripped my dress. Where are we anyway?
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting? <+++++> Leave him alone!
And you thought IÂd respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries? <+++++> Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
<i>Whatever.</i> He's a criminal. And this Ed Martin character is a complete loser. <+++++> He used to date Pat Benatar!
How do you know? <+++++> It's terrible -- you just made it up.
How's my little cheerleader? Now I know everyone at your high school isn't so uptight, come <u>on</u>. <+++++> Hey really, I don't feel so great.
Hurry up and get dressed. <+++++> Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
Do you recognize my voice? <+++++> I think so. Detective squad?
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore. <+++++> My loyalty was never to my country.
You have no idea what this is doing to your body. <+++++> I like Trix!
Oh Captain, that is so true. <+++++> Stinks.
We had to finalize the deal. <+++++> Everything looks in order.
I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive. <+++++> We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
Don't talk to me like that. <+++++> Why, what are you going to do? Kill me? Take your best shot.
Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for. <+++++> Well, what now?
Boy, he is great! Jeez, that old fat man. Look at the way he moves. Like a dancer. <+++++> Twelve. Cross side.
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter? <+++++> What do you mean, dear?
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her! <+++++> I DIDN'T...
How would you like a spanking? <+++++> How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
How much? <+++++> Nine thousand dollars.
We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables. Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson. <+++++> I know it.
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him. <+++++> Certain?
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue. <+++++> I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
I wouldn't know, Dude. I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and-- <+++++> Which one was Logjammin'?
Dad, please... <+++++> What was it, Roswell?
You come in here at least three times a day. You a retard? A buck fifty. <+++++> Damn, Sal, put some more cheese on that motherfucker.
But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet <+++++> There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan
Or anywhere where people might see us. <+++++> Belinda's a very jealous person.
Baudmore Consultants. <+++++> Is Jerry Delsano in?
God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban. <+++++> I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
Here. It looks like you need a refill. <+++++> Oh no.
No, I'm not! My mom taught me. <+++++> Your mom was a dancer?
You bet we did. <+++++> It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we?
Hello, Steve. I'm glad you could come. <+++++> Why did you call me?
It's a bloody funny thing. <+++++> Yeah. A bloody funny thing!
That's on the second floor. Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you? <+++++> They nailed the windows. I can't get'm open.
Try this. I found a great jar of it. Olive oil. In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife. <+++++> Thank you.
No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it... <+++++> And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
Must be some sort of gateway. But, why this place... ? <+++++> We should go.
Yes - <+++++> And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.
I'm handling it. <+++++> He let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --
Mmmerrick. <+++++> Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
Can you walk? <+++++> Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning. <+++++> Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
I'm Walter Peck. I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District. <+++++> Great! How's it going?
You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde. <+++++> How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
I come to Grandma's funeral. Here's your admission card. <+++++> Thanks, Charlie.
Well what do you want to talk about? <+++++> Anything. Anything at all.
Less than thirty minutes. <+++++> Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can.
Then why did you run away? <+++++> Because you ran after me.
You sure you heard what I said? <+++++> Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half here. Maybe you oughta run on along. But why don't you take this phone number?
 <+++++> Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too. <+++++> Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
Have you seen this? <+++++> Yes - the worm!
Well, there was a time  when you were very happy to be only with me. You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music. <+++++> Mm-hm.
Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that? <+++++> You can learn from books.
Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not-- <+++++> *Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--!
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work. <+++++> You already went back to work.
Hi. Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed. <+++++> I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts. <+++++> Can't arrest ghosts. But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.
To get your attention. <+++++> Did you know her?
It's all right, George. It's cool. Just wait here, all right? I'll be back in a coupla minutes. <+++++> Thank you.
A Runner gave it to me. <+++++> And then you killed him, right?
Override the airlock sensors and hurry! We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods! <+++++> Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
I promise. <+++++> Where am I to go, Jimmy?
One of whom? <+++++> Shell Oil, Junior. He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
Concentration. Heh? Concentration. <+++++> I thought those seekers were set for stun!
Then the devil is white. <+++++> I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole. <+++++> Ah. An explorer.
 <+++++> Um-huh.
I get the imports. <+++++> Ok!
Son, was Rose in your room last night? <+++++> No. Why should Rose be in my room?
Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy? <+++++> Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang.
Is that right? <+++++> That's right.
What do you mean? <+++++> I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener. <+++++> ... The gardener? ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma. <+++++> A what?
After four years and now the question comes up. <+++++> Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
Judge gave 'em the long ride. <+++++> Life, huh? They step outta line again, we'll shorten up that sentence real fast.
Why? <+++++> I cannot explain.
You said we were criminals, what did you mean ? <+++++> You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty. <+++++> Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.
You caught me on an "up" day. How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco? <+++++> I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was. So you're looking for "fast advancement".
 <+++++> Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.
Happy As the next man, I guess. I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean. <+++++> You're a little touchy about it.
It'll work.... <+++++> Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away....
Doing what? <+++++> Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
You set me up... <+++++> I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
No, no, I want to. I'll just go into the village. <+++++> It's not a village. There's nothing there.
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight. <+++++> You know I hadda meet some people tonight --
And keep only forty-percent? No thanks. <+++++> Then relax. It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government. And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles. No questions. No problems.
Well we're pretty -- <+++++> Why isn't he locked up?
Why are you doing all this? To impress me? <+++++> No. But are you -- impressed?
You're in the stomach! <+++++> You sure?
What? <+++++> ...Afraid.
Why me? <+++++> 
No kidding? <+++++> Yes.
Open up there, will you! <+++++> All right -- all right!
I can't imagine any place better than here. <+++++> You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
She's grown up some, hasn't she? <+++++> Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you?
Now what? <+++++> Now what what?
They're gone. <+++++> Where'd they go? Back inside?
I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally, I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies. <+++++> Movies?
Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he? <+++++> Open the door.
Can't you make other creations? <+++++> I could. Of course I could. But no one would be like you...
"Liebestraum." <+++++> I just played it.
He's into kind of little cars, that... <+++++> That remote control thing?
The ship sinks. <+++++> What about E.M.S. recombination?
 <+++++> The phones are working?
The Scimitar will serve my needs. <+++++> But surely...
Totally groovy huh? <+++++> Totally.
Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better. <+++++> So did I.
Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about. <+++++> That I should've picked you up?
I write poetry. <+++++> Uh-huh.
Readers' Digest, April, 1939. <+++++> Well, I only quote from the best.
I fantasized about you. <+++++> About me?
They range up to three thousand. <+++++> Yeah, but we're--
Okay, give me a bottle of wine. <+++++> Red or white?
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise! <+++++> We've got a nice plant here.
How do you know? <+++++> Believe me. They couldn't be busier at the moment.
Yes. <+++++> Get out of here, Jack!
Do you miss it? You seem like you do. <+++++> When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much. <+++++> Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something. <+++++> Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
It makes you nervous? <+++++> Yes.
No, we don't. <+++++> Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
The battery's in, that's done with. Besides, you'd do the same for m... <+++++> ...<u>might</u> do the same. I have to warn you 'bout that, chief.
Um-hmm. <+++++> Where's Kansas?
But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us. <+++++> And when you finally get Two-Face?
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left. <+++++> Why wasn't I told? Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported. Is that the best shot we can get?
What...? What if I say no? <+++++> Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan. It's a nice, safe country.
Or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him. <+++++> I found him.
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya! <+++++> But what about this?
Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness... <+++++> Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
Why are you getting dressed? <+++++> You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
No. I'm okay. <+++++> Perrier? San Pellegrino?
Your dried cum. <+++++> Jesus.
I already have. <+++++> You don't know how true that is.
So we don't know for sure about you, either. <+++++> No.
What happened... ? <+++++> Don't ask.
She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception? <+++++> Look, someone gave her the baby.
How did I get here? <+++++> You we're lost at sea. They pulled you out. Who are you? You were shot -- two bullets -- in the back.
You're the Oracle? <+++++> Bingo. Not quite what you were expecting, right? I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip. Almost done.
Heidi, I'm dying. <+++++> I blame myself, Sonny.
Yes, well, why don't you show him around and... <+++++> Aye, sir --
He'd call every once in a while. <+++++> He called the day he escaped.
What are your plans now, Mr. Chance? <+++++> I would like to stay and work in my garden.
We've never sent this much with one courier. <+++++> Your plans are a little different this time. You skip Miami, and go straight to Geneva. It's to be deposited to this number.
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya. <+++++> Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
Never mind. Listen. Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer. Why? <+++++> It's that LSD und his verdampter babies!...
Let me take you out tonight. <+++++> You mean, on a date?
What's eatin' you? I've blown money before. <+++++> No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
Yeah. <+++++> That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?
I think so. <+++++> You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
Oh, Jesus! <+++++> You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes. <+++++> The war dropped him here and forgot him.
She loves that thing. Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll want to take you for a ride. <+++++> I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.
Have you ever tried any? <+++++> No.
What is he doing? <+++++> He's beginning to believe.
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation. <+++++> ... Are you sure?
She's calling the shots now. <+++++> You're impressed with her, aren't you?
I earn his trust. Then more pain. Then I appear with kindness. Within a week he will follow me around like a dog. <+++++> But will he be house-trained?
I don't know, what was the case? <+++++> Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl. Period.
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up? <+++++> No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
That's why she kills children. <+++++> I know, I know--
-- what kind? <+++++> It doesn't matter.
He is totally crunching on you. <+++++> Do I want to be crunched?
Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time. <+++++> You don't think there's much time left, do you?
Cream of the crop, huh? You? <+++++> Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone.
Yeah. <+++++> Are you mad at me?
knowÂbutÂ <+++++> Here. Eat your head off.
Another cup of coffee? <+++++> No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back? <+++++> Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now... <+++++> Why do you think --
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on! <+++++> I don't care if they wear galoshes!
You think mafia hit? <+++++> Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
What are you thinking? <+++++> I don't know...
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face. <+++++> I'm telling Mom.
It can't be as bad as that. <+++++> Worse.
Who? <+++++> Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
Take care of business. <+++++> What does that mean?
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too. <+++++> Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
You have a pimp? <+++++> Uh-huh.
I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. <+++++> Then help her.
You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry. <+++++> God, but I love that sexy talk.
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko. <+++++> So whatta you got for me, sport? Why are you here?
Has she been buying any odd things lately? <+++++> Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff. --Lest you call paper odd.
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I - <+++++> That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous -- <+++++> Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let us pretend I am King and you are Captain of my Musketeers.
Right? <+++++> Yeah...
He can't. The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines. <+++++> That means you won't have a gun.
But, Kurt, I... <+++++> No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
You know, I noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke. I could sense the chemistry between us. <+++++> Really?
Yeah, they call me Dar-... <+++++> ....-lene.
He's already there. <+++++> What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
And they all score high on the insomnia charts. <+++++> Good.
Yeah? <+++++> You haven't paid the cab. He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.
He's clever. He had help. <+++++> He's clever? He had help? Oh.
That's not what you said. <+++++> What do you think I said?
Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!! Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him. <+++++> No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
Two. <+++++> Can you follow them?
I don't want the job. Don't do that to her. She's worked too damned hard for it. <+++++> What's going down with the sting in Chinatown? That gonna be off your plate in a week or what?
You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance. <+++++> Ten-four, hon. This is for you.
Huh? <+++++> My father proposed to my mother in there.
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays. I got it right here... <+++++> Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday. It's not that hard.
Being faxed over now. <+++++> How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records.
Philip. <+++++> Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade. Now you're helping to nurse it back to life.
Right! <+++++> A nickel.
What, do you work for my boss, dog? <+++++> Okay, okay.
You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat. <+++++> It burns.
How far? <+++++> Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
We have to go into that cabin and search it, Sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt. <+++++> I know. Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that? <+++++> Oh, fine.
Well, uh, I don't, it's really -- <+++++> What is it?
James? My James? What's happened? <+++++> Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician - <+++++> Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
In case!!! The gun's in case!! ! <+++++> In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall? !
That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal. <+++++> A homosexual scandal, you mean? For me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks.
I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it. <+++++> With the other hand, right?
What's wrong, Doc? <+++++> Nothing. Not a thing. I'm right As the mail.
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp! <+++++> You're my father.
 <+++++> But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom. <+++++> Really? That was fast.
I can't go back to sleep again. <+++++> I haven't slept much either. Since Kristen...
Be careful, Conner. <+++++> Conner?
If what? <+++++> If I hadn't done it. If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.
Bullshit. What's out there isn't alien. It's an animal. <+++++> Maybe so. But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
We don't know what we're into! <+++++> We're in the shitter, man! Pick your poison. Maybe he's in there to finish the job. Maybe he's working for Wombosi.
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed? <+++++> Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
How'd they -- <+++++> What have you done?
You have a girlfriend? <+++++> ...yes...
Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league. <+++++> Twombley involved?
Just walk away. <+++++> You don't think we're going to make it.
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that. <+++++> Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
We think so. <+++++> Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two Sherpas and a yak.
Hi. <+++++> You going to ask me in?
I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church. <+++++> Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
I'm sorry this came up. <+++++> This is just... so...
Good morning. <+++++> You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
I know. <+++++> I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know? I'm an artist.
Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school. <+++++> The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
...check...? <+++++> The twenty-five thousand dollar one. The one with your name on it. In Bernard Barker's Florida account. Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar--
This was a beauty. Right, Calo? <+++++> Beautiful all over, eh?
Vehicle references. <+++++> Wrong cabinet.
And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's. <+++++> I like the President. He is a very nice man.
Christine what? <+++++> Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know? <+++++> I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.
You're talking nonsense. <+++++> Oh, no I'm not. These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
I'm sorry, Mr. Massey, but I felt certain you'd want to know -- Marylin Rexroth wants to see you. <+++++> Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it. <+++++> What do you get out of it?
Mobile Infantery rules ! <+++++> Death to all bugs !
Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir with you. <+++++> Oh, yes, yes.
Yeah. <+++++> He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each! <+++++> Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.
Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either. You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter. <+++++> Am I? I'm not so sure. I used to be sure of a lot of things.
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on. <+++++> Oh.
Are you afraid? <+++++> Not when I'm with you, Ted.
I'm in. <+++++> Me too.
Why don't we go to Paris next year? I've never been. Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling. <+++++> I'd love to.
The bulk of the series. <+++++> Uh-huh.
I need some money right now. <+++++> Can't you wait till I'm dummy?
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can..... <+++++> Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business.
Is... is everything all right? <+++++> Everything's gonna be fine.
Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record. <+++++> I don't think that's necessary.
We've got pressure. <+++++> Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
Relax! I'm the map! It's all up here. <+++++> Oh that's comforting.
What's to think about? <+++++> You goin' right back to work?
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter. <+++++> Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep? <+++++> We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
I saw Sarah the other day. <+++++> Her knee acting up?
Now we can do whatever we want. <+++++> Stop it.
Sure I do. You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said. <+++++> It's a cover, then. A cover within a cover, a feint within a feint.
Fuck this, let's get something to eat... <+++++> What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
At what point? <+++++> At the point -- I don't -- Look you'd be on TV maybe one or two times each.
<u>Ear plugs</u>. <+++++> Exactly. At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear. <+++++> What about McCoy?
... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it. <+++++> You have to make a decision: is this guy partner material?
What did you think I would do? Jesus Christ! I gave up my life and my music... <+++++> I never asked you to quit!
Just wait there for me! <+++++> Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You motherfucker!
Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there. <+++++> No, really?
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution. <+++++> I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you.
That's fine. <+++++> But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious.
You know I love you... yeah? <+++++> Yes.
And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty. <+++++> Oh come on. There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
New baby? <+++++> One week old.
So you're monumentally busy? <+++++> Well, not monumentally.
Layton. <+++++> Jill Layton ...  You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here?
Get it? <+++++> Leave me alone -- !
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are? <+++++> I'm your landlady
The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill. <+++++> He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
What happened? <+++++> No one knows. The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals.
What about Thomas Ripley? <+++++> What about Ripley?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in? <+++++> Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy.
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time. <+++++> Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
No. This is going to be our last session. <+++++> Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
It's from hunger. <+++++> Nothing for Ladd?
It doesn't necessarily mean she's... <+++++> Let's go around back.
Why not? <+++++> Because I never got around to it.
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes. They thought the Russian was a nice touch. <+++++> I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
Meteorites! <+++++> Bingo!
On your pillow. <+++++> I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad. <+++++> A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport.
Must be your lucky day then. IÂve got your accounts - you donÂt owe much tax for last year. <+++++> Good.
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to. <+++++> With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
Yeah well why should I suffer for that? <+++++> Suffer? We're living in America.
What was he doing? <+++++> Trying to change the past. He said it was the only way to save the world --
Aw, c'mon. <+++++> That's ancient history. That has nothing to do with you and I.
Okay. <+++++> I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
Did I miss anything? <+++++> Oh, not much. Gates just had his tonsils taken out. The hard way.
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down. <+++++> Naw, you didn't let me down. It was a long shot all the way. We gave 'em a good run at it.
I haven't seem him for a year? I'm gonna cook him a dinner. <+++++> Dinner's another night, darlin .. This is a drive-by. I got an hour ..
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there. <+++++> I'll have to do better than that.
A river pirate. <+++++> Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett. <+++++> No shit! He's good!
What else did he tell you? <+++++> That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
I couldn't make it in time. <+++++> You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
Liar. Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right? <+++++> I came from the city on the left.
I don't talk that way. <+++++> Remember, skiers stay up longer.
I've got a hot one. <+++++> You go, boy.
You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters. <+++++> M'sieu Laval!
You'll pick up the middle on this one - the Jews and Negros. <+++++> Jews and Negros don't win elections, Henry. Better to hang them around the Democrats' necks.
And your husband works for somebody else. <+++++> What the hell are you saying?
Those fuckin' deadbeats... <+++++> My ass. I told 'em. Listen to this: I said...
You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones. <+++++> I don't like to show off.
Barely, yes. <+++++> In 1944, five members of the O.S.S.
Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving... <+++++> A normal person.
Then why didn't they take it. <+++++> Probably didn't have time.
Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women... <+++++> Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here. <+++++> Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
I would like some fresh straw. <+++++> Louis... water and fresh straw!
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped. <+++++> I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother. You know what he called Father one time? <+++++> No.
I know you believe that. <+++++> ...Don't you?
Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex. <+++++> Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
Throw that away. <+++++> This?
What? <+++++> Us seeing each other.
There's our man. <+++++> Finch, you got the Latin homework?
Are you nuts? <+++++> The man said just to use my imagination. Let's see...yeah, I get it. Potential. I can see it now.
Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him! <+++++> He's a fucking maniac!
Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary... <+++++> Opinion, Mister. Spock?
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared. <+++++> I had a witness disappear on me.
You need time to think. About the case, about you and me. <+++++> I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
...-ians. But I assure you, Leo... <+++++> ...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans -- <+++++> Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
Sneaky, that Chili Palmer. So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him? <+++++> Leo, I don't know.
...Just doin' my job. <+++++> You called me, I knew they were there, so what do I need these for?
Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return. All parts intact. <+++++> He wants 75 back.
You haven't heard me yet. <+++++> You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice? Will I bleed from my every orifice? Who will clean up this awful mess?
Then it's going to happen. The world's going to end. -- And you've always known. <+++++> Always. Ever since the day I died.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him? <+++++> No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
It's really nice up here, isn't it? <+++++> I love it. I really do. I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation. <+++++> Well, we can try...
I dunno. <+++++> Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
I want it as soon as possible. <+++++> Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out. <+++++> With what? Against how many?
Take another look at these two. <+++++> I don't know them.
But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me. <+++++> Let me explain you something, kid. Stooling is when you rat on your friends, on the guys you're with.
Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load. How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall? <+++++> Indeed.
I think it's pronounced gauche. <+++++> Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.
I'll give you a boost. <+++++> You first.
Yeah. <+++++> She's getting big. Getting her own ideas.
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits? <+++++> I envied him. Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
But it'll stop the movie. <+++++> Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'. <+++++> I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
What? <+++++> Can I be honest?
All right. <+++++> Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']
Yes. <+++++> What does <u>that</u> mean?
Where did you find this clown? <+++++> I thought he was with you.
American literature. What else? <+++++> What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Yes -- you are. <+++++> I'm going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar.
It's a change. <+++++> Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there! <+++++> And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it.
Excuse me -- what did you say? <+++++> Monkeys. Twelve of them.
Where are you staying while you're here? <+++++> A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus? <+++++> No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me.
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are? <+++++> Where?
You crazy nut! You crazy, crazy nut! <+++++> Get away from me!
I sabotaged it? You're the one who lost him, remember? <+++++> Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
The man in the garden. He was full of courage. <+++++> Un sapo?
But I feel The Force flowing! <+++++> Anger, fear, aggression! The dark side of The Force are they. Easily they flow ... quick to join you in a fight.
Please! <+++++> Am I right?
Didn't you get?... How are you? <+++++> I'm fine. Can I go up?
Italian? The Mafia...? <+++++> Who knows. Who cares...  You wanted slime. You got slime.
Dust cloud ahead, Sire. <+++++> That's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. See the spotters over it?
I think I better take you home. <+++++> What about those other guys you live with?
The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E....to even consider it. <+++++> I need thirty. Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front...
Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it. <+++++> Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
No. <+++++> What you mean, no?
You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan. <+++++> Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
But what if he doesn't -- <+++++> -- He will.
You might talk too much. <+++++> Yeah and what would I say?
Somewhere else? Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here. How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself? <+++++> Okay, I'm stuck. You happy? Now can you fix it, or not?
That was almost nine months ago she wrote. Letter took a while to find me, but when it did, it was just the right time. <+++++> Where were you?
CONTINUED <+++++> How did they manage to do that without any communication?
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line. <+++++> Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
Eleven. <+++++> Damn. 'And Wainwright...'
The "Odessa Dunk"? <+++++> It worked in Odessa...
A Yater spoon is hard to get -- especially here. <+++++> He's a man who knows what he wants -- he does know what he wants.
I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea. Want to see me take him? <+++++> Yes!
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell." <+++++> "Save yourself. From Hell." What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
You'll take care of it? Not this time. No way. I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight. <+++++> Bullshit! Bullshit!! You're selling it back! That's an order!
Stay! <+++++> If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment. <+++++> 
I'm just going to get the name of their truck! <+++++> I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way.
Yeah. <+++++> Can I tell you something?
It wouldn't work. <+++++> I know.
She's swell. <+++++> Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
It's too late. The movie's made <+++++> They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
What is? <+++++> I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
They're here! They're here! We have the nanobot. <+++++> Excellent. How long until the assembler tank is complete?
That's my bag. <+++++> Go to hell!
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history. <+++++> What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
Fancy. <+++++> This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
Mind if I cut in? Your date's lonely.... <+++++> The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
Look at me, Hildy -- <+++++> I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful. <+++++> Thank you. What time is it?
You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy? <+++++> My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
You repeat "Third Reich" as though you expected there to be others. <+++++> Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
This place is a trip. <+++++> Buddhist monastery. Fifteenth century.
Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing? <+++++> Sometimes.
Jaguar's a darn pretty car. <+++++> I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.
Kid, get outta the way! ! <+++++> NOOO! !
-- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter. <+++++> Even the so-called New Town isn't so new. Only the people. People of the future living in buildings of the past. Has anyone seen Eduard?
Well give me a reasonable explanation <+++++> A miracle is an event without an explanation.
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit. <+++++> Eat me.
Why am I being lectured in this way? ! <+++++> Forgive me, Your Majesty. In no way did I wish to suggest--
Four billion dollars. <+++++> Seen one billion, seen them all.
Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us... <+++++> Mister McMurphy!
You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore. <+++++> Christ, Jack, it's her birthday.
CONTINUED <+++++> 
He's turned into a completely normal person! <+++++> Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?
There's a Sanctuary... there is! <+++++> You want there to be one... that doesn't...
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out. <+++++> Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours.
I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime. <+++++> Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.
You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben Damon. <+++++> Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
...It's very American. <+++++> No, man, it's very smart.
Yes. <+++++> ...and open the French doors and go on the balcony --
General Lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen, and... how many cases of muskets, Mon petite Marquis? <+++++> Uh... none just now, but...
You seem surprised to see me. <+++++> I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
Uh, Udall? <+++++> Carol the waitress?
Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember? <+++++> Ted, listen to me...You and I, we had a really crappy marriage--  Look, don't get so defensive, okay?
Michael! Jesus  I've been trying - <+++++> Rowan...?
Look. I know they hate me. <+++++> They don't hate you --
You got any broken bones? <+++++> No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim? <+++++> I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry. Call me whatever you like.
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come. <+++++> Is there food?
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance? <+++++> I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
Don't say that about my mom! <+++++> I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart.
THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE. <+++++> But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you.
You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things. <+++++> Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
I could have been better! <+++++> The point isÂ there isn't much time, kid.
That's the subject of my last chapter. <+++++> Not an easy book.
Aren't these <u>illegal</u>? <+++++> Why would they be illegal?
What? <+++++> I said just relax. I'm in full control.
Wait a minute! What'd I do? <+++++> I got you cold, pal. Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
If there was a problem, they could do something right? <+++++> Of course, that's what they're for.
What? <+++++> Chicken?
Sounds like singin'. <+++++> Oh, no...
No, you didn't. When? <+++++> Didn't you get my message?
No, you didn't, Frank, thank you. But there's still a couple hours left on the shift. <+++++> I need a drink, that's all.
She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from -- <+++++> Danny, go downstairs -- Now!
I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great. <+++++> Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted. <+++++> I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.
Dragline gives out the names here. You'll get yours when he figures you out. <+++++> Maybe we oughta call you No-Ears. You don't listen much, do you, boy?
You have not slept in two days. <+++++> Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
Is anything missing? <+++++> No.
Don't just become excited. <+++++> I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.
I'm only half human. <+++++> Deanna Troi of Betazed. Empathic and telepathic abilities, ship's counselor. All of this I knew... But I didn't know you were so beautiful.
...About five years now. <+++++> Get the fuck outta here.
Of course I knew. <+++++> It just slipped your mind.
Yeah. <+++++> Do you enjoy it?
Some of us are trying to sleep. <+++++> You didn't tell me you lived with her.
Yes what? <+++++> Uh, yes, it is important.
I just thought that -- under the circumstances -- you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs. <+++++> No. Most of them are in transit by now. I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
It's just a stupid cat. <+++++> Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
Before you. <+++++> Ben where do you have to get to?
What's average? <+++++> Sex murder: three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds. Eight in Mrs. Jacobi...  ...that's all I have.
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that. <+++++> It's none of my business?
Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again. <+++++> Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
MacReady...? <+++++> He's one of them.
The same. <+++++> But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples. <+++++> Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
You wanna keep it down, she's trying to sleep. <+++++> Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
He don't want to talk? <+++++> We worked it all out beforehand.
Gave you? Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that... <+++++> So how would you put it?
She seems pleasant enough. <+++++> She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
It's important, sir! <+++++> Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
What for? <+++++> It's early.
Well, look who's dressing for success. <+++++> At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
Burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>! <+++++> We blew it, Edgar! We lost it!
Hey, that's the guy- <+++++> We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
Dr. Kent. <+++++> You're looking well.
Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars. <+++++> We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year. <+++++> I don't know.
Maybe myself. <+++++> Then it's worth the journey.
Please don't have me arrested, please! I didn't steal anything - you can search me! <+++++> How did you get in here?
Did you see the winning run score? <+++++> You're not making sense. Make sense.
So you wanna git bit, huh? <+++++> Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!
So, Zuzu. Are you okay? <+++++> Yeah, Ford. I'm okay.
I have yet to avenge his death. And yet I'm thinking of quitting. I must pray for his forgiveness. <+++++> Join me once you have finished. I can wait for you in Peking.
Why do I feel that you know what's going on? <+++++> Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife. <+++++> You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that. You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
I want you. <+++++> It's not my line.
It's actually DH-1 Digitech Pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator. <+++++> I don't know what that means.
Running time? <+++++> One hundred and sixteen minutes.
Let go... <+++++> My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.
Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook! <+++++> What's the matter?
Whisper it... Whisper "fuck me"... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper... <+++++> Fuck me.
Mr. Clear Moon. <+++++> Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning... <+++++> Oh, appreciate it. I was trying to, ahh, give a sense of history to...
How are you, Raymond? <+++++> Freezing. But I'm getting warmer.
They ruined me tonight. <+++++> Dean, I love you. Do you hear me?
I wanted to see her. It's nobody's business. <+++++> It is. You got yourself on TV again.
When did you last sleep, boy? <+++++> I'm all right.
Time to change her diaper. <+++++> Time to leave.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend... <+++++> Let me see what I can do.
Now who are we talking about? <+++++> Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
Finish him, finish him. Your way. <+++++> Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini. Which way is my way?
Hello, Eve. <+++++> Your leg must be getting better.
Why don't you help us? <+++++> Uh... I guess I'm just not hungry.
I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some -- <+++++> It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home. <+++++> Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
Really. You sleeping? <+++++> Only on odd days.
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes? <+++++> Sometimes I forget.
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago? <+++++> Find this little girl, get her somewhere safe. Call the local T.V. station. Tell them to get people off the streets and behind locked doors.
You heard me. Why did you go out to the institute looking for her? <+++++> What makes you think I was there?
--or someone-- <+++++> --scared the living shit out of us.
Where is your mad pilot? <+++++> He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
Taking care of her fucking dog. Going to her fucking synagogue. You're living in the fucking past. <+++++> Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax-- YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE PAST! I--Jesus.
That must be interesting. What drew you there? <+++++> Women. 'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
You all right? <+++++> I don't know, I mean, I-
The whole town's in a state, Kiki ÂÂdoors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep ÂÂnobody on the streets at night ÂÂ <+++++> Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
What? <+++++> It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
But surely you must know -- because I love you. <+++++> Because you love me -- you love me?
Yes. I do. I want it to end now. Let her go. I'll come -- just let her go. She's not important. <+++++> You know where.
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me. <+++++> Well, what is it?
It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go. <+++++> Stag?
Who knows? <+++++> Where do you want it?
You calm down! <+++++> <u>Calm</u> <u>down</u>.
Paul said you were awfully sick. <+++++> I was, I was. It never lasts long.
How you know that? <+++++> Cause I thought Glen was gonna sneak out to see your lunatic daughter, that's why. So I locked him in his room! Sorry.
I tell ya, there's an angel of mercy standing out there, Turkle. <+++++> Hallelujah, brother, now get back in bed!
What's she singing about? <+++++> What do you think?
Truce. <+++++> Dinner. Don't be angry.
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night. <+++++> Out and about, doing odds and sods.
We can't. We're going back. <+++++> To what?
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool. <+++++> Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.
Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord. <+++++> Look, I told you inside--
And what if I don't want to give up on her? <+++++> You don't call.
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head... <+++++> Shut up!!! Shut up and drive! I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like? <+++++> I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony. <+++++> I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
Do you know the... soccer stadium? <+++++> Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident? <+++++> You know, I'm not sure. I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.
I would try for them. <+++++> You barely know them.
That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave? <+++++> Um...sure.
That's it all done, we are off. <+++++> You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
I'm sure you're not going crazy. <+++++> Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
I'm afraid. <+++++> It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.
Huh? <+++++> The World Series. You called Buford's homer.
Yes. <+++++> Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.
Sorry, Sandy. I've got plans. <+++++> What? Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
What's your real name? <+++++> Roy.
This is one big house for one single person. <+++++> Well, you never can tell... I might get a pet.
I can't? <+++++> It's sold.
That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure. <+++++> Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir. <+++++> At church?
How about Magruder? <+++++> He checks too.
I hope it's not your dear sweet mother... <+++++> No...
Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting. <+++++> It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
For Agnes. <+++++> You think she's a saint?
Promise? <+++++> If you bring the caramels.
I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia! <+++++> The tennis player?
Oh shit, you gonna take that? <+++++> What?
Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me. <+++++> How do you think you got this job, cock? Mmm. I'm still tingling all over from our little midnight swim.
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore. <+++++> Well, that's good news, my boy.
Careful,  Captain, they've been known to charge. <+++++> All right I got a little surprise for you --
A month from today? <+++++> Yeah.
He wanted to kill me! <+++++> It's okay, you got a lot of protection.
What about the others. <+++++> I don't know.
Genius! --  Lex. <+++++> I'll be alright.
Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?' <+++++> Climax together.
He walked eighteen? ! <+++++> It's a league record.
Ah, our last night at camp...I always knew it would be something special. <+++++> What do you want me to say?
I'd do the same. Well, catch you Thursday. <+++++> You bet.
Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak. <+++++> Well, what a lucky break for me.
He gets one day of confession each year. Today is the day. <+++++> Who does?
You can keep what you won today. That's yours. <+++++> It's all mine.
Yes. <+++++> Did he come in with you?
I forgot the napkins. <+++++> And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
Navigational deflectors inoperative...! Directional control also inoperative, Captain...! <+++++> Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
I didn't know this would happen. <+++++> He had my picture! He knew I was here! He came here to kill us!
Sure. Good-by. <+++++> Good-by, Tommy.
I can't. <+++++> It's your choice.
I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible. <+++++> Yeah.
What does this mean? <+++++> It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
No. <+++++> Let's go.
Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair. <+++++> I swear it will be done.
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them. <+++++> But it's more than just that, am I right?
Chiang Cho? <+++++> ...across THE BORDER. Come on!
I'm overworked as it is. "Raban" did you say? <+++++> Yes. Isn't it there?
Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that. <+++++> You want some advice? Don't do this again. You know exactly what I mean.
Yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck. What's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much. <+++++> Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance.
Why do men chase women? <+++++> Nerves.
Is there anything else I should know about him? <+++++> Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet.
Where does he think he's going? <+++++> When you gotta go, you gotta go.
Three: "We want to end the robbery by the white man of our Black Community." Christ, they're asking for reparations... <+++++> They couldn't have thought this up for themselves.
Never mind. It's nothing. <+++++> Anything else you don't want me to know?
We make love? <+++++> No! No! We don't make love. Go to work.
Nothing to be sorry about. That's the way with men and women, isn't it? <+++++> What's the way?
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM! <+++++> How did you know that?
Pull up a chair. Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT. <+++++> Pleased to meet you.
Little Bobby... Just a kid... <+++++> They're hurting us, baby. Huey locked up. Bobby Seale running all over the country holding things together. Cy dead. Little Bobby...
What's my problem? You want a list? <+++++> You really don't believe I'd take on a partner after all these years without a little...insurance?
I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia. <+++++> Well, what do you know about that!
Walter, they're calling the cops, put the piece away. <+++++> MARK IT ZERO!
It's a shame. He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore. <+++++> So did you get his autograph?
And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see? <+++++> Mmm hmmm.
What happened? <+++++> I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
He was a President. <+++++> President? Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.
...I don't know. <+++++> Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
The blonde dish. <+++++> If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
What story, Mr. Rogers? <+++++> The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
Now it's your turn. <+++++> What secret shall I tell?
What happened to Seymour? <+++++> I can't believe it - he actually scored!
Where are we going to go, mommy? <+++++> We're going to go someplace new.
I just saw Gray. What was he laughing at? <+++++> He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
Jaime? Where are you? <+++++> Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
Oh. <+++++> Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
No. No! No! <+++++> I repulse you? Very well. It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!
I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail. We can't risk it. <+++++> What are you thinking?
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity. <+++++> I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ... <+++++> Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
Right... or more likely the opposite. <+++++> Right... Wait, what do you mean?
He is. Usually. <+++++> Whoever comes up with that will make Woodward and Bernstein look like Abbot and Costello.
What. <+++++> There's been some trouble downtown.
Why? <+++++> To live in. There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
Was he? <+++++> Could you do me a favour?
Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of.... <+++++> ...WHY DID HE COME BACK? WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
Did what? <+++++> Got you here.
Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something. <+++++> Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
Thank you. I'm Rob. <+++++> Duh.
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big houseÂ <+++++> When 'we' . . .? You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?

Michael - I saw him! Twice! Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger. <+++++> Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings. I mean --- that's CRAZY.
Are you sure? <+++++> Absolutely.
What are the problems in stopping the Heart? <+++++> Nothing -- compared to starting it up again.
But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head? <+++++> Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here.
...OK... Good. <+++++> Can I sit on the stairways now?
He must have got the keys... off Stanton. <+++++> Great. Well that changes a lot...
Do you feel better now? <+++++> Do you?
Are you all right? <+++++> I'm fine.
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed. <+++++> You didn't believe her?
There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time. We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call. <+++++> You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.
Oh yeah? <+++++> You know, over at the mill, there's just one guy that talked. It's kinda late to say it, but we shoulda acted different.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault. <+++++> Baxter?
Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above-- <+++++> But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water.
Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division. <+++++> Oh, yeah -- right.
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.' General textbook on the subject. Is  that correct? <+++++> I. Yes. It is.
Understand? You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind! <+++++> Joseph, are you afraid to cross that river with me? I accept your resignation. With regret. You have leave to return to Philadelphia...
Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage. <+++++> On my way.
He'll know we're in trouble. He heard me, I said "There are three..." <+++++> He won't even know who it was.
You really think so? <+++++> I know so. He, them, they're not to be trusted.
Oh my God... What is that? <+++++> That's one piece of four problems.
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile. <+++++> Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
Like what? <+++++> Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him. Did he say anything while he was still lucid?
Then why weep for him? <+++++> Would you not? He was father. And mother. We fell from grace together. He from his God. I from mine.
What the hell do you think you're doing? <+++++> We're going to need everyone.
You going to be okay? <+++++> Go on, 'they're stahting.'
What's he been in? <+++++> Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example.
What do you mean? <+++++> Her face had a sour look... that means we're going to have trouble with the local authorities.
I was being selfish. And majorly insensitive. And I'm a total idiot. <+++++> I think "shithead" really says it.
I know. I've been here since eleven. <+++++> Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
Nobody else can. <+++++> I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through <u>Handbook for the</u> <u>Recently Deceased</u>.
A cop? You want me to trust a cop? ! <+++++> No. Trust me.
There is -- there is no family. <+++++> What do you mean there is no family?
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something. <+++++> I know, you want go for a ride.
Boring. <+++++> Of course. That's the point. "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
So...what did you think of the tape. <+++++> I think you gave me the wrong one.
That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy? <+++++> I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place.
I am the great and powerful Oz... <+++++> J.D.! Just tell me. I know you're not some schoolboy. Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
Will you marry me? <+++++> Marry you?
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency. <+++++> We ain't got a constichency! Stokes got a constichency!
Okay -- let's try and settle down here. <+++++> <u>Settle down</u>? I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry!
Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me. <+++++> Must you use that awful word?
Good luck, Richard. <+++++> Someone down here?
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie -- <+++++> Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are. <+++++> Very.
Oh. <+++++> But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life.
We're doing everything we can. <+++++> Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
Young man, I already told you she's not here. <+++++> Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist? <+++++> Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.
Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one. <+++++> Hello, copper. What brings you down to Florida?
My lady! <+++++> Who is there?
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ... <+++++> Too many cooks --
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments... <+++++> No what?
That's the only way you can have a country! <+++++> It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.
Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book. <+++++> I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me. We're going.... <+++++> Get out of here, Leave me alone.
Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir. <+++++> Yes?
'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land." <+++++> Your father was a sick weirdo.
The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other. <+++++> With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!! !
You got it. <+++++> And get a doctor.
I've seen 'em. Lot to dust. <+++++> Well, I've never lived with beauty. You must love working here.
Why? <+++++> So they can have their hamburgers!
Ready to make a little history? <+++++> Always am.
Anybody live here? <+++++> Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
It's been a long time. <+++++> Yeah, but here you are. How'd I get so lucky? I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
I don't want to scare people. <+++++> I understand. But Mr. Cuthbert, we've got bigger problems. Depending on what we find today, we may have to shut you down.
Which way? <+++++> That way.
We're on the Cointreau. <+++++> That's right. Cointreau.
No, I don't. <+++++> You played it for her and you can play it for me.
Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile? <+++++> I forgot I had it on.
Yes. <+++++> See my nipples?
Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain. Open it, please. <+++++> Calm down, Dr. Levine.
So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right? <+++++> Mmmmm . . .
Weren't you a little worried about her...? <+++++> There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house. There's phones there. I cruised the place, but I didn't see her.
What have you found out? <+++++> I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.
Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had? <+++++> Why?
Show us a little more cooperation first. Where were you born? <+++++> In a village called Domremy.
I can't. <+++++> That's not good enough. Why not...? !
Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent? <+++++> It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
It's different. He's a man. And by the way you have no business calling him a homo. <+++++> It never crossed your mind?
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly. <+++++> Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons. Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY!
He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his friend. All right? <+++++> Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
How's everything? <+++++> MMMmmmmmmmm.
What tunnel? Where? <+++++> It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way.
Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse. Dry fire it whenever you get the chance. And do your exercises. <+++++> I will... I promise.
Marcee, things are changing around here. You and Rod will have my total personal attention. <+++++> Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
Maybe he should be worried. About me. <+++++> He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.
Really. <+++++> Long time ago. I was just thinking about her. I was her first boyfriend.
I couldn't get it to go down. <+++++> And why was the alarm on?
I refuse to be your slave. I refuse -- <+++++> -- to fight? We'll see...
Where do I put ashore? <+++++> Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.
A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves. <+++++> Nothing in there except a New York street map.
What did we do? Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks. <+++++> No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve. It's on the level this time.
Are you all right? You coming down with something? <+++++> No, I'm fine. I just got light-headed for a second there. Let's go.
Why are you mad at each other? <+++++> You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
I speak as I find, Archie. <+++++> Not down south you don't.
In my room. <+++++> Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government. They're confidential.
Thank you so much. You have to let me pay you something -- <+++++> No. Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it. I did it.
It's only a flesh wound. <+++++> It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds.
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift. <+++++> Whatever.
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good. <+++++> Margaret.
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf! <+++++> Of course not.
Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts. <+++++> But rather than selecting pieces from each individual, he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones.
Where is it touching you? <+++++> Down there. And I'm nervous.
So we're gonna be close next year? <+++++> You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long. <+++++> He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.
We've got a lot of work to do. <+++++> Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here. <+++++> Is it safe?
Any word from Canada? <+++++> Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
I was irresponsible, I should have called. <+++++> You bet you should have called. You still live at home.
No? <+++++> I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
I am sorry you feel that way. <+++++> And I'm sorry you look that way, short-ass. That suit stinks and you obviously dye your hair.
Up yours. <+++++> Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene.
Tell me... <+++++> Tell the king to give me more men.
And then what... he touched you? Did you maybe flirt a little... <+++++> I wanna go home now.
Do you mind? I'm-I'm my own person. <+++++> Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
What am I wasting my time with this shit for? <+++++> Because it's your job, that's all.
Maybe. Not really. <+++++> Archbishop of Canterbury. Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...
Noooooo! <+++++> You--you gotta get us out of here.
This is for the best, you know it is. Why do my socks keep disappearing! <+++++> "Honey, I'm a zombie, I don't know whether I'm coming or going."
... but the output went to shit after three seconds. I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies... <+++++> You need a break. You'll see it clear when you come back.
What's Kirshner? <+++++> Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?
Yes, I guess I'll have to. <+++++> Thank you. If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.
I... I can't do this. <+++++> We have no choice.
Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding? <+++++> Think it was a guilding. It was grey. Oh it was so beautiful, the guy let me ride it all around.
What? Beth? My Beth? <+++++> Yeah. We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."
Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him. <+++++> Can't. Got plans of my own.
Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more. <+++++> Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment.
Damn right! <+++++> Gimme a Hostess Twinkie, Merle.
His ashes? <+++++> With love.
Paramount studios. <+++++> Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad? <+++++> It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
How is he? <+++++> Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.
A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth. Don't feel embarrassed about it. <+++++> Okay.
What do you think? Is he coming in? <+++++> I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
... Use his women. <+++++> ... Any information you have, Edgar. The sonofabitch is not gonna steal from me again! Can you back me up on this?
...dat's too much money. I can't 'ford it. I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than... <+++++> ...aconite get it dat cheap.
One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me. <+++++> Have you got that in writing?
Look closer. <+++++> ... A falcon?
With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!! ! <+++++> Nick... NICK!!! It's the only chance we've got!
It's okay. <+++++> Stick around, please?
Never heard of it. <+++++> Oh, you would have done great.
Well, did you find me? <+++++> Not yet. Say, where is this boat headed for?
Am I running away? <+++++> The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.
I haven't been invited. <+++++> Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started. <+++++> That's thirty percent.
Jesus Christ, Rob. Is that really what's bothering you? <+++++> Of course it is.
Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here. <+++++> Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
Blake, I can handle that transplant! <+++++> We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
That's when you need to cement, and define define define. <+++++> Exactly. And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
Did you always want to be a lawyer? <+++++> No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
I cannot stop the sand. <+++++> You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
Why? <+++++> Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning. <+++++> Hey, you know. I was thinking...
Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here. <+++++> Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
It's just possible she didn't... <+++++> Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-! Karen, let me tell you about Eve.
What am I going to do now? <+++++> Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
I felt you...looking through me... <+++++> We walked all night...
Naawww. <+++++> Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
What does he see? <+++++> 
No, no, no, no, no. <+++++> If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business? ! <+++++> His wife has diabetes!
That's none of your business. <+++++> You're wrong.
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you -- <+++++> Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
What happened to Kurtzweil? <+++++> As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
No, that's not it. Nothing like it. <+++++> But you said grey, sir.
There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque? <+++++> 27156789/074328/K.
How could I forget? <+++++> Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog. <+++++> I had to. Didn't I?
I hereby acknowledge that... <+++++> And now I have "dociled" you, have I not? By forcing your obedience.
Where's Rob? <+++++> The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite. Do you have an appointment?
I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile. <+++++> I hope so. Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
 <+++++> Yes, sir...
You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating? <+++++> I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams.
Deputy... good evening. <+++++> What brings you out to these parts?
Proceed! <+++++> Three hundred pounds!
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while. <+++++> We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
 <+++++> 
You're never getting that much. <+++++> I think I am.
How did you see me? <+++++> We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
No. <+++++> What do you want, then?
No, Jeff--please--! <+++++> I say it's *your* parade, sir! You've *got* to come!
What are you doing here? <+++++> I was lost.
No... How? <+++++> The Telegraph office.
You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city. <+++++> That was never mentioned. Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
What happened? <+++++> You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
...That's not true. <+++++> What?
Why do people think anything? <+++++> I don't know! Tell me!
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh! <+++++> You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
A... A  sweaty-toothed madman. <+++++> Now there's the poet speaking! Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see. NOW!
I can't believe this. <+++++> And there are some towns in Missouri where James and his men can walk openly, as heroes.
I know you do, Sidney. <+++++> Don't judge a situation where you don't know what's involved...
I'll be totally wiped out! <+++++> I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
...Well, it didn't make him happy... <+++++> But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
Listen, it sure didn't like this flamethrower. <+++++> 
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help? <+++++> Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown... <+++++> You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination. <+++++> No?
Oklahoma City. Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then... <+++++> You talked to him?! Is he mad? Did you tell him?
No you weren't. <+++++> I was, you bastard.
A pneumoencephelogram, I would think, pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal. <+++++> Oh, Christ.
Light in those passages ain't so good. <+++++> I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
You're hearing about somebody else. <+++++> How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
What for? I haven't done anything. <+++++> We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station. Have you made any purchases here today?
I love your smell. <+++++> -- I guess you haven't.
Give it here, Bernard. <+++++> Whoa, check it out.
Cactus--shooting a man in the back is not very noble. <+++++> That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
But why? <+++++> Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been? <+++++> I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission. <+++++> I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
It's an order. Get everyone out now. <+++++> I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping.
What's your take? <+++++> What's the point? It's going down.
What's that, like a P.O. box. <+++++> Something like that, yeah.
Well, you're half right. Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me. <+++++> About what?
I know... <+++++> Y'see? That's the real point here.
Hello. <+++++> Hi.
I've got the stuff. Come here. <+++++> Aren't we ...
No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ... <+++++> Thank you very much.
I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film! <+++++> There's still a sex-change --
Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man. <+++++> Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
Right next to the one you already had. <+++++> Look, Mr. Brenner...
Thanks for giving me a ride. I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side-- <+++++> Whoa, whoa, whoa. I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.
She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor. <+++++> She did a Harriman.
Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her. <+++++> I wish I did.
Don't try to be a policeman, old man. <+++++> What did you expect me to be - part of your...
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you. <+++++> All of what Dewey? You do know something, don't you?
She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing. A relief, actually. <+++++> God, I hate that time. That pick up stuff time. I just went through that before I came here.
I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry. What is it they call you? Mr. Rock and... <+++++> Don't say it. Orange juice?
You know what I think? <+++++> What's that, Ed?
She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that... <+++++> You should have proved that in a court of law.
Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you. <+++++> LEAVEMEALONE!
Good -- it looks fine. We had quite a ride together... <+++++> It's undamaged?
Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer. <+++++> Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
As if it's that easy. <+++++> It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money.
Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time. <+++++> I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer.
The girls threw them at me in the locker room. <+++++> Okay. That's bad.
Where's my information? <+++++> In here...
If there was one. <+++++> "... wait for help." Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
Oh shit. Harry... what're you doing? <+++++> I'm giving her an assignment. I am offerring you a choice.
Sorry, I'm working now. You see, I have a job... <+++++> Randy, c'mon!
--amazing coincidence! Of all places in the world--to choose Willet Creek for his boys' camp! <+++++> Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair!
It has come to be... The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh! The time of the prophecy is upon us! <+++++> Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan. You know exactly how to turn my crank!
She's tough. <+++++> Is it really four thousand?
Yyyess. <+++++> Yyess.
Go on. <+++++> I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
Oops, I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh? <+++++> No, what does that mean, find the clitoris?
You know him? <+++++> Owns the hardware store.
Oh come on! <+++++> What about keeping an open mind?
It's locked. <+++++> Shit. I'm sorry.
Yeah. <+++++> Weird what you remember.
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by... <+++++> Sister! I'm his sister!
Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip. <+++++> You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
It doesn't seem right, this being down here. It ought to be where people can see it. <+++++> After they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it.
I overheard him with the girl. <+++++> <u>Shit</u>! That <u>fuck</u>! Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!
Do you want me to say I did it? <+++++> I was kinda hoping, yeah.
Where? <+++++> What?
Was she carrying a weapon? <+++++> No, she was crying her eyes out.
Don't do this. <+++++> You bastard.
I buy them flowers. <+++++> How you treat them?
We hang down here and drop. The garbage'll break our fall. <+++++> I think not.
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself? <+++++> What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.
That's what you need! <+++++> No, no, no! I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
We're gonna try. Place needs a lot of work. <+++++> I can only imagine. You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions. <+++++> Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day. <+++++> Who'd you go with? That's not good.
Do you have the material? <+++++> You first, Edvard.
...little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party...City Council...? What's the trouble...? <+++++> Main Street.
Say hi to Zoe. <+++++> I will.
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed. You can't make the jump in this asteroid field. <+++++> Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
Nine? <+++++> Nine!
Doug... <+++++> Now:  the Waterford Merchant's Association, of who I am Council...
Hi. <+++++> I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being. <+++++> I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac. <+++++> This is good work, X, damn fine work.
He was just doing his job. <+++++> So was I.
Nowt. <+++++> Good lad.
See ya, Bandit. <+++++> See ya, Kate.
It's all right, ma...I been watchin'... Only I wish... <+++++> What, Ben?
I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out. And I think I know a way to-- <+++++> <u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down. <+++++> Yes? And?
Why not? <+++++> But this is public property.
They don't bother me. <+++++> Yeah, you weren't in that last one.
I don't know him that well. <+++++> You know he's colored? What else there to know?
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that. No way. I've never killed a man. Never even shot at one... <+++++> Well neither have I, but it's us or him.
Why not? She's an attractive young woman. <+++++> Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time.
I don't know. <+++++> Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
What time did we go to the funeral? <+++++> I think four.
That's where they keep them. You want me to bring the tooth out here? <+++++> Um. No, no. Let's go.
Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today. <+++++> Don't you fucking knock?

Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too. <+++++> You're not crazy.
Name your poison and I'll supply it. <+++++> Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
I don't know, sir. <+++++> Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing? Whatever the price? Isn't that what makes a man?
How 'bout a western? People love westerns. <+++++> But, I don't like horses. Do I have to get on one?
Don't hurt me. Harlan. Please. <+++++> Shut up.
You come out here and talk to me, you fucker! <+++++> Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -
It's very small. <+++++> Big enough.
Under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. This is the notice. <+++++> Do you want to come in?
This Magua led us into it. ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here... <+++++> Thank you. How can I reward you?
Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone? <+++++> I don't know.
Listen, we got young girls here... you could watch your language. <+++++> I speak what I feel.
Very weird. <+++++> Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
David, do you want me to stay here tonight? <+++++> Yeah, I do, but go to work.
Thanks for coming out. <+++++> Neutral ground. What's up?
No? <+++++> No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
How do I know? <+++++> You know when you know. It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
Please stop it. None of that's true. Goddamnit, I love you. I loved you ever since I met you. <+++++> Come on, Paula!
A useless talent. <+++++> Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...
No....I though  I'm afraid. <+++++> You're not cleared for this precinct. Let's cross over first.
Five steeds and a few hackneys... <+++++> As much as for a Lord? What an honor! Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
Because he was scary, that's why. <+++++> Who was scary?
&quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot; <+++++> That's nice Ben.
If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite. <+++++> No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us!
The pause that refreshes --  Care for some? Smells good, doesn't it? Pungent, with just an irrepressible hint of iron. <+++++> Pass.
Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise? <+++++> Did you call me up here to enjoy yourself, Emily, or to let me use your phone? Because we seem to have a slight problem...
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it? <+++++> Don't you think he trusts us together?
What are you getting at! <+++++> I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me. I've exorcised forces from this house. Eliza knew, she was there.
They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints. <+++++> And they went to the stockholders in New York.
Where are your men now? <+++++> Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house? <+++++> Of course not, Joe. It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.
You really want to do business? <+++++> Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money! <+++++> I wanted to, Jeff. Oh!
You might have killed him! <+++++> Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll watch these two.
But do something, Monsieur Cornillon! ...But they are my jewels! There must be some way of getting them back! <+++++> What does he say?
Who with? <+++++> Pauline.
Stop it, Jez. Don't do that. <+++++> Do what? I haven't done a thing.
"I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom." <+++++> Maybe they have to pee.
<u>Yes</u>... <+++++> About <u>conflict</u>...
What's the big deal? <+++++> Well I never did it.
That's true. <+++++> Then there's the other issue.
Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one. <+++++> She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
Okay, what do you give me? <+++++> What do you want?
Yeah--that's right. Diz-- <+++++> What?
AS WE LOOK UP, WE SEE THE PRESIDENT BITING HIS LIP, AND CONTINUING WITH THE SPEECH. <+++++> From whence did it come? Our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents. Of Armed and Violent Dissidents...
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us -- <+++++> Just shut up, okay?
Because I have dreamed of him. Not as the baby they took away, but as a man. <+++++> You have prayed too much. Your mind is weak.
But! He's Mac all over again. Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet. The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth. <+++++> Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it? <+++++> If you want to steal it, that's your business. At least I won't have you around here making noise. It might be worth it.
Got him at an auction in Kentucky. <+++++> How much?
Something's up wi... <+++++> You think I didn't get that?
Stay away! <+++++> Or you'll what? CAN ME?
Good to see you're feeling better. <+++++> Now <i>you're</i> here. Who are your "friends"?
Just terrible? That's better than yesterday at least. <+++++> How long have I been on Gateway station?
Florida license plate. <+++++> He ate a car?
I have. <+++++> Well, I have, too. Would you do it <u>again</u>...? In't that why you're here?
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire. <+++++> Drop her a postcard. Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us. <+++++> Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor. <+++++> Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial.
What have you promised them? <+++++> Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged. <+++++> I gotta stay up, Max.
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination. <+++++> No, I saw a guy shooting from over there. He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
I don't have any time to see you now. I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then -- <+++++> Very well, I'll watch.
Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm celebrating tonight. <+++++> Please, no thanks...
If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before..." <+++++> "Before what?"
Kicker! <+++++> Defense droids. I'm on it.
They wouldn't have changed the security setup. <+++++> When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here.
Why? <+++++> To relax.
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car! <+++++> God willing.
Thank you, sir. <+++++> Dewight McClusky of the California Prison Board. Take a seat please.
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family. <+++++> The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head. <+++++> You didn't say Simon Says.
You don't know that! <+++++> All right...
So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't. <+++++> Then you do think it was Ambrose.
They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you? <+++++> I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation. Now: What happened to him?
Where's Ruby? <+++++> She went.
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK! <+++++> GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
Five times. <+++++> I had it at four.
...but would further cement the relations of our countries. <+++++> Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored... But you see - well - I --
Maybe you'd better ask him. <+++++> What were you and Anna arguing about?... Excuse me for being so indiscreet, but this is serious...
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you. <+++++> Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
How's it going chef? <+++++> Okay.
Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in? I'll be right down. <+++++> Honey, I... I can't... it's the...
Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3 <+++++> Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
Yeah, but aligning with white organizations. I'm not sure now's the time. <+++++> The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, "the moment the match is being put to the fuse."
Awaiting his arrival. <+++++> What about the cat?
These old Victorian houses are great, aren't they? <+++++> It's not Victorian, everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was Victorian. This is gothic, this is English Craftsman, this is Romanesque.
I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you. <+++++> Who else you been to see?
We got a mistrial, you know. Joe -- did you hear what I said...? <+++++> I don't want a mistrial.
That. <+++++> 'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
Yeah, you were saying? <+++++> Excuse me.
It was my decision, not his. <+++++> Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose... <+++++> -- Never mind.
...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join. <+++++> Victor. I love you,
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it. <+++++> If a leopard didn't do it, who did?
I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out.... <+++++> If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up.
Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night. Still alive? <+++++> Yeah. At Bellevue. Still hanging on. But they still don't know if she was pushed.
He knew the penalty for breaking regulations. He ought to pay without sending you to beg. <+++++> You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this. I, too, was at that farm.
I'm afraid you are. <+++++> No, I'm not...
...Huh? <+++++> Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed -Â He'll come up with something. <+++++> You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I? <+++++> You're entitled to your opinion.
Well, Normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time. How are the hands...? <+++++> The guy I told you about - Aaron...? He says I can learn to control them. That I could lose the gloves at some point.
Yes. <+++++> How do we get out of here?
Those yours too? <+++++> My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
Don't be funny. <+++++> You want your tennis stuff?
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'? <+++++> At least once more, Miss Swann. As always.
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today? <+++++> Of course, he's in the lineup. There he goes right there. Hey, Babe...!
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name. <+++++> Oh. "Kyle."
Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it. <+++++> Do...what.
You don't remember that? <+++++> I don't remember much. It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it.
You think the D.A. 's gonna file on Joanne? <+++++> I don't know.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk. <+++++> It's nice to do a lot of things.
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away. <+++++> So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
You would be, two, if you'd gone through what he went through. <+++++> He raped a <u>Nun</u>...
We can't kill it on board. It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body. <+++++> I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry... <+++++> He did what he was supposed to.
A User -- in our world? <+++++> Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
He doesn't gamble. <+++++> I'll watch.
Why not? <+++++> I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell.
I tell you that dame's nuts. <+++++> Right.
Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage. <+++++> Right. See you sometime.
Larry... <+++++> What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
Could that be Camden Market? <+++++> Yeah. Why? YouÂre going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
Have you known this all along? <+++++> Well you can understand why we didn't say anything. If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
Did you hear that? <+++++> I heard that.
You haven't seen it. <+++++> Yes, I have.
No sir... <+++++> It's none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.
Because I don't walk away. <+++++> Why not?
Relax. <+++++> How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus-- <+++++> Dissent?
I'm not an intellectual.... I mean, I read, but... Fund-raising isn't what I... <+++++> Look, if you want to kill Jews on your free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for us?
What's the first commandment? <+++++> Thou shall have no other God before me.
No. <+++++> No!!! ?
You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that. <+++++> Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented. <+++++> And it's bullshit.
Am I what? <+++++> Making it with my mother?
Can I ask you something? <+++++> I'm sure you will.
Where did he say he was going to meet you? <+++++> I thought he said by the monkey house.
Thought you were going to bring her. <+++++> So did I.
Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. It undermines our whole cause. <+++++> I see.
The photo on the left shows the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin, true? <+++++> True.
B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow. <+++++> Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.
What do you have, Danny? <+++++> You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that.
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street. <+++++> I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
You don't look nothin' like me, mister. <+++++> I didn't mean no offense. I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.
So ... ? <+++++> We outgrew each other.
George? You better get yourself a good lawyer this time. We're gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one. <+++++> Oh hey, one more thing?
Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school. <+++++> I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own.
And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'. So buddy... I say we work a trade. <+++++> What do you mean?
Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M. <+++++> Oh, Jesus... how?
Wipe 'em out? <+++++> Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise. <+++++> Think you'll live that long?
Are you kidding? I'm not going down with you for killing a cop. <+++++> What difference does it make? You killed Jake.
Photographer? <+++++> Sent it.
You don't look thirty-five. <+++++> How old do I look?
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up. <+++++> What'd you do?
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead? <+++++> They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
Probably. <+++++> Kind of wish I didn't.
What are you saying? <+++++> Why aren't you understanding?
Bev, you're the greatest... <+++++> Hey, I'm next.
When's your birthday? <+++++> What?
Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl. <+++++> Okay, okay.
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact. <+++++> What for?
Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell. I hate these people. <+++++> They make gypsies look good.
You hate me don't you? <+++++> I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better. <+++++> What about the other night. What about last night? Was that to get to know your character?
Is that all? <+++++> Ah, you should see the swan! His masterpiece. Now, walk along the beach and stoop to pick up the shell.
It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone? <+++++> Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson? <+++++> He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
What "group"? <+++++> Third group.
Gimme your gun, boy! <+++++> No, you gimme your gun, boy!
What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse? You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it? <+++++> A lot's happened since last weekend.
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker... <+++++> She's not ugly.
What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car? <+++++> It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?
That's it. <+++++> Why didn't they say that before you started?
When are you finally going to get your diploma? <+++++> I dunno, but next week is my last class...
We're very unhappy. <+++++> What do you expect? You're dead.
You? Volunteer? I don't think so. <+++++> I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive.
No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry... <+++++> That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
 <+++++> That's exactly why we want to do this play.
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me -- <+++++> Doc, I trust you! You've listened to me better than anybody... maybe ever.
So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them? <+++++> Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.
She's the mother. That means she's within her legal rights. <+++++> John, what if she kidnaps him.
He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar. <+++++> You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do. <+++++> Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
You wanted that child out of the way. <+++++> That's a lie.
Why? <+++++> I've got something for you.
Oh. Yeah, I guess I do. <+++++> Has anyone else every used your phone?
It's been a tremendously transformative year -- maybe a little controversial of course, but we're breaking down the old Unitarian barriers -- <+++++> I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --
Simplify and damn. <+++++> DonÂt you believe in simplicity?
That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys. <+++++> I am one of those guys.
This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean? <+++++> Right now, I care only for the safety of this crew. You don't know anything about these two -
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1. <+++++> So, it's not a winning record.
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all. <+++++> You liked her?
Let's not do this, okay? <+++++> I need to know.
That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart. Would you live that pain again? <+++++> No. What am I to do?

Now what? <+++++> Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape. <+++++> You won't dare to interfere with me here. This is still unoccupied France. Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault.

How ya doin' Miss Evans? <+++++> You missed every one of your career counselling sessions. Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
And he didn't die of old age either. He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered. <+++++> I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.

Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?! Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands. <+++++> I will, Admiral.

My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep. <+++++> Oh, honey.

I beg your pardon? <+++++> Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain.
You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>? <+++++> I'll call that little bluff. How close?
At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back... <+++++> If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent. <+++++> And I actually date you?
You want to know if he's okay. Right? <+++++> Yeah.
Why is this? What is happening? Tell me! <+++++> Reting Rinpoche has been arrested. He tried to overthrow Regent Taktra. Today, he is brought back to Lhasa by government officials.
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind. <+++++> No kidding.
Stop that! <+++++> You'll never get away from me!
What have you got to do with it? <+++++> Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
I don't know, Clarence, "Doctor Zhivago" is a pretty big movie. <+++++> The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film.
All right then. <+++++> What do you drink?
A duty few men are fit for, but you were born for. You'll be working out of Homicide. <+++++> Homicide? A detective?
Bathroom over there? <+++++> Yeah.
Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget. Just keep looking forward. <+++++> But was it a bad decision? At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow. <+++++> Yeah, well, I check out today.
Claire? <+++++> Three o'clock.
You? You went by the book? <+++++> Yeah, problem was, I had the only copy. See ya.
Oh. Yeah. <+++++> You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
Stop busting my hump.... <+++++> Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates. And I've got no time to screw around. <+++++> Will you let me explain!
Ugh. Muchos moscos, man. This is too much. <+++++> Just some flies.
What he talk 'bout? <+++++> Why don't you sit and I'll read you something he said.
Boring. <+++++> Nothing's been boring since you found me.
We had a deal! ! <+++++> I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
I thought you would have some ideas. <+++++> Why should I tell you?
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious? <+++++> Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard. <+++++> How?
No, I don't. <+++++> Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
Are you? <+++++> We'll do it together. I'll clue you in. Timing's got to be right. The old man says it's up to Joe.
 <+++++> Yes. You walking to the subway?
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry. <+++++> What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
He had help getting up there. Two of his fingers are broken. <+++++> We had one thing figured wrong. I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
Why don't you just leave it alone? <+++++> No, I gotta do something. I don't Suppose you'd card-
Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but right now I -- <+++++> Tripp, where the hell...
Hi, Santa Claus, how are you. He's with Sears, I'm with Wal-Mart, twas the season... <+++++> We're all outta gifts, boys and girls, but we got charitable donations!
You don't have two million. Three million - - <+++++> I'll borrow it from you. Four million - -
What do you want -- ? <+++++> Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
Your wife knows that, don't she? <+++++> Sure.
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up -- <+++++> Really?
At what? <+++++> At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance.
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere? <+++++> Telly is at Steven's. There's a bunch of people over there. Come on dance.
Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear. <+++++> Got it.
They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne? <+++++> Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
You want me to stay? <+++++> Yes.
No, but many consider my training valuable. <+++++> 
Summers are short here, Annie. There isn't much of a fall. Before you know it, the roads are closed... the nights get long. <+++++> I don't care! We'd be together.
I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds. <+++++> If she was his wife, she should have all the money. That's only fair. I don't want a penny of it.
I'm going to call the police. <+++++> No, you can't do that--they'll get suspicious--
Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me. <+++++> I am not. And I don't gotta.
Why's that? <+++++> He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything. He made us think it was over and done with.
What is wrong with you? <+++++> I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
No one comes here after dark. <+++++> Hide the car.
Eddie Dowd. <+++++> Roger Baron.
It's true. <+++++> This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
Juarez - Chihuahua City road. <+++++> Don't you want to go to the airport?
By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted - <+++++> But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job.
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about. <+++++> Nothing?
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you. <+++++> That's fine--because you're going to see a lot of me ... for the rest of your life.
Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally-- <+++++> Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
Johana... New York. <+++++> What kind of name is that? To be named after a city?
So what's your angle? <+++++> Sorry. Trade secret.
Seems to me like you ought to show it some respect, you follow me? <+++++> Yes sir..You right about that. That's just what I come over to talk to him about. Just that..
They paid us half. They still owe us half... <+++++> There it is again. That lousy attitude that got us here in the first place.
You mean the whole house? <+++++> Yes.
Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got. <+++++> You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
It's almost nine, I've been so worried! What did you see in there? <+++++> Nothing.
Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it. <+++++> Me? What'd I do?
It was okay? <+++++> It was inspirational.
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say. <+++++> What?
Simpler. <+++++> We.. We lie.
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find Âem. <+++++> Alright, Johnson, thank you. So...what are you wearing?
This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force. A servant of evil it is. Into it you must go. <+++++> What's in there?
You want to come inside? <+++++> Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything.
They'll just keep calling. <+++++> Someone's gonna die someday causa that bum, going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of Mr. Oh.
Instructors typically pull three year assignments. This guy's in and out in one year -- your year. That sound right? <+++++> Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night. <+++++> Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night. Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.
To save the world. <+++++> Where have I heard this song before?
No! I mean... why so soon? <+++++> If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.
So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW. You still seeing him? <+++++> No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . . . . . Your what? <+++++> My baby.
Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night! <+++++> If you're trying to be funny, Homer...
I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing. <+++++> I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
Before or after you killed the child? <+++++> I left it with her and I went for help.
It's a little cut, nothing. <+++++> I've been worried sick.
Fellas. <+++++> Hey, Sam.
You mean that's all you had me come out here for? <+++++> Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
She got anything good? <+++++> Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs. Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?
Excuse me. <+++++> Yes.
So he goes, "Fuck it." He gets in his car and drives home. <+++++> Holy shit.
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled. <+++++> Well, take them off.
Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner. <+++++> You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.
Have some cigars. <+++++> No thanks, I don't smoke.
Charley Wade. <+++++> That badge--
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko -- <+++++> I said say it again. I didn't say repeat it.
That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too... <+++++> With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling... <+++++> That pain is hunger.
Awful? <+++++> Beautiful. Sad. She died!
Yes. <+++++> You don't have that one, do you?
Come on. <+++++> This is some boat. Your father's?
You got any better ideas? <+++++> Mind if I ride along with you?
So don't marry him. <+++++> If only it were that simple.
German, is that you? <+++++> Vincent, come down. I've found him.
That's it... <+++++> Looks simple to operate.
So she had you in jail, in Russia? <+++++> Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
Shh -- don't talk. Hold still. <+++++> I have seen it, but I don't remember this part. Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.
God, you are so hot. <+++++> Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.
Who's in? <+++++> I'm in.
That's what he said, is it? <+++++> Yes. Abbot understands these things.
I've got to talk to you. <+++++> Sorry, I'm way behind.
I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted. <+++++> Where are the tapes?
Remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' I do for a weekend once every ten years. <+++++> I will, and you remind me of the same thing.
Danny?! Danny! <+++++> Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy who came in with me and --
I'm not afraid of the dark. <+++++> I admire your valor, Jack. By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.
Do you think I... <+++++> Danny, please, we don't want to know.
What's going on? Why did he call you Macleod? <+++++> Because it's my name.
And he was ripped limb from limb? <+++++> I'm sure they were exaggerating.
Yeah, air. <+++++> Naw. I bet'cha it's something better than air.
French toast... and mashed potatoes. <+++++> Now we're talking. How about you Merrill?
I... I don't believe this. <+++++> Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
Oh hey, one more thing? <+++++> What's that?
Yes. But Alfred's condition is less severe. Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's. It just doesn't say how. <+++++> I checked the medical database. No one else is even close.
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies. <+++++> Really?
Definitely. <+++++> Ask her out.
Why's that? <+++++> My features. They're Finnish.
And you believe that? <+++++> I have to.
Barks a blue streak. <+++++> What's wrong with him?
Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?! You're always making me feel like a piece of shit. <+++++> Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing. <+++++> Yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you?
And... <+++++> ...the rest of the two million is still there?
No. He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist. It was Peter. <+++++> I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist. Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast. <+++++> Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
Hi, John. <+++++> Where are the tapes, Graham?
I don't know what to say. <+++++> I'm not the police. I don't care about experimentation. She's a kid. I'm worried to death.
The more he thrashes, the better. <+++++> You ready on shore?
The mines, the wires, there's a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them. <+++++> What do I do?
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian. <+++++> He could?
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally. <+++++> Next to your father?
Which I didn't have. <+++++> And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient. So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.
Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia. <+++++> All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes.
Stensland's a disgrace. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. But White is a valuable officer. <+++++> White's a mindless thug.
I don't drink, but you can go out. <+++++> You don't drink?
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context. Know what I mean? <+++++> It made me feel like you could see inside of me. And I don't know how that's possible.
Your cell is more than adequate. <+++++> Right. So what do we do now? Ping- Pong? Row over to the monastery?
At least you and Kendall agree on that. <+++++> What happened next?
No, I just assumed... <+++++> You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right? Are you a racist?
You can't play around with these tent people. <+++++> I'm not playing around. I forgot.
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why? <+++++> Toto, sooner or later there comes a time when talking or keeping quiet is the same thing. So it's better to shut up.
Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz? <+++++> I met him.
You fucking bastard. <+++++> Don't you get it? They had their 2,000 years. Now it's our turn.
It'll cost you five bucks. <+++++> Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it?
No, no, it isn't. It's cool. <+++++> Look at you!
What? <+++++> Did you hear that strange music?
Sorry. <+++++> It's okay.
You sound like Houston Mission Control. What the hell does it mean? <+++++> That we swim.
Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it? ? <+++++> Sir?
I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated. <+++++> A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
Just an hour? You should tell this stud to take more time. <+++++> Will you shutup. I should never have told you about him.
The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise." <+++++> So what stopped her?
Higher. Higher. <+++++> Higher.
Are you crazy? What makes you think you'd survive? <+++++> What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim? <+++++> That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service. <+++++> I actually know how this works.
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia. "[2] <+++++> Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people. I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb.
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here. <+++++> Yeah, let's just get outta here.
I don't have any. <+++++> I can see why.
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well... <+++++> Is that your version of a pep talk?
Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda. <+++++> You might keep this. I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.
Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys! <+++++> Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed! <+++++> Try again.
I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes. <+++++> There are more important things than tits.
I want you to stay and find Wynant. <+++++> I did find him!
Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%. <+++++> You don't understand.
'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.' <+++++> It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.
Who was your primary beneficiary? <+++++> She was.
I'm talking to you. My clothes and things are up in the room. <+++++> Naturally. I brought them myself.
No, I'm just going to head home. <+++++> Okay.
This kind of heat. It's pathetic. <+++++> Well, I guess you pick your poison.
I don't understand. What do you want from me? <+++++> I told you already... I'm here to set you free...
No, no, no.... we'll punch <u>in</u> a kitten. Um... <u>Later</u>. <+++++> ...you're gonna Punch in a Kitten Later.
You woulda? <+++++> Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion. <+++++> Wallace's followers.
I don't know. <+++++> If I ask him to tell me, will you let him answer?
Am I like Such a fellow? <+++++> Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
The ship.... <+++++> Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.
Your soul...? Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle? <+++++> I don't expect you'd understand.
Stay out of it, Carter. You're going back to L.A. <+++++> Fine with me.
Mason. <+++++> Shit! Oh, shit.
Hans, he killed by brother -- <+++++> Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way.
They are in tune. But not with each other. <+++++> Is that important?
Oh? What idiot put you in charge? <+++++> You did. You murdered by Boss. Now... They're looking to me. Personally I'd pass on the jab.
How was I? Tell me honestly. <+++++> You were sublime.
They are coming to see you <u>act</u>. What are you doing this evening...? <+++++> I'm having dinner with W...
He will learn patience. <+++++> Much anger in him, like in his father.
Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you. <+++++> What did they look like?
Nothing was done, and the motorcade went ahead on schedule - and this wasn't even mentioned in the Warren Report! Read it, Al. <+++++> "Threat to assassinate President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, November 22-23.
I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities. <+++++> Do you think they'll go along with us?
Where in the States? <+++++> Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that. <+++++> I come from a big family.
What do you know about obsession? <+++++> Not much.
I'll work it off. <+++++> Not driving Jess, you won't.
Lie...? <+++++> There are things you will not tell him.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him. <+++++> How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
I'm not. <+++++> This is Monica and Ryan. Mac and Clair.
On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS. <+++++> Oh god, oh, god, no, I...
Don't worry. We'll work something out. <+++++> Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D. ?
About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you? <+++++> I might have his number on campus.
What do you think, eightball? <+++++> The police department?
Oh Jeez. <+++++> Will that do? No?
Which one? <+++++> The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
All right, Captain Oveur. Over. <+++++> Poached! Not over! Over!
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake. <+++++> Says you were constantly calling me a slob. It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored.
How'd it go, son? <+++++> She misses me.
No, I think you were. Come on, admit it. <+++++> I was worried about the rig. I've got over four years invested in this project.
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos. What's the name of the place we're staying again? <+++++> It's called... the Gritty Palace.
[Don't lie to me.] <+++++> [The boss did or his brother.]
Caesar, ignore them. <+++++> Ignore that?! The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
How long has it been? <+++++> A goodly length in times past, but lately
I don't know. He made me see the stars ... <+++++> How did he do that? All those kids ... Why do they hate me so much?
That you're a mistake? <+++++> She says my whole body's a mistake.
Yes, but the curtains were drawn. <+++++> 'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know. Sure is a peculiar thing.
Please... forgive me. <+++++> What?
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting. <+++++> I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain. <+++++> All right... elevate me!
...your ducts? <+++++> I fixed it myself.
You wouldn't be in the way. I like having you around. <+++++> Dear, I was thinking. Why don't we go to Paris next year? I've never been.
 <+++++> No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?
What does it mean? <+++++> The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
And why, please tell us, would you think that? <+++++> After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.
Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery? <+++++> Uh-uh.
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him? <+++++> No... But...
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job. <+++++> Don't go.
We'll have to bury him. <+++++> What's that?
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something. <+++++> We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all right? <+++++> Yah, geez, Scotty. I'll go talk to him.
You ever going to bed? <+++++> No.
Slow down, take a breath... <+++++> It doesn't stop, Nick. I paid the bill, I gave 'em their money, but it all started again.
I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live. <+++++> You and the land are one. Drink from the chalice. You will be reborn and the land with you.
No, just a coffee. <+++++> One beer, one coffee, thanks.
And you want these girls to feel your pain? <+++++> Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
Take it back. Till you sell your book. <+++++> Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
James! You have come in here on purpose? ! <+++++> Well...uh...
Why? <+++++> Because he drove Jessica insane -- deliberately -- coldly!
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out. <+++++> Push 'em back.
Hey if you're not doing anything I'd like to buy you a beer after work. Be just like old times. <+++++> What's the occasion?
I just said I didn't fuck around. But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me. <+++++> What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
It was okay. <+++++> You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
Oh, come on! What are you talking about? <+++++> You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff...
Sounds good. But right now I should go. <+++++> You should stay.
Wait. How about this? <+++++> Now you're squinting like you need glasses.
And, Miss MitchellÂI think from now on you'd better work directly with me. <+++++> Yes, sir.
I hope it's not the oven again. <+++++> Yeah.
Got to follow the paper path here. <+++++> Chuck, forget the Xerox. So Russia didn't turn out well?
Where the fuck is that bitch? <+++++> She's with me.
I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it. <+++++> I'm afraid my people haven't. I'm very sorry -- I wish it were otherwise.
It's a little late for matinee heroics, Mason. Just give me the con-... <+++++> ...-tainer!
Home sweet home! <+++++> To you maybe.
She was angry at herself. <+++++> Jackie?
Because this must be stopped. <+++++> How shall I do it?
Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm? <+++++> Should we make a run for it out the back?
Where are you? <+++++> Closer than you think.
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me. <+++++> She would if she heard my voice on the phone.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill. <+++++> I just want to be on my own for a while.
Why? <+++++> He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
Here, try this. I suppose they're still making women the same as back then. <+++++> It's beautiful.
Now what can I do for you? <+++++> I was hoping we could talk.
You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it? <+++++> I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
What do you mean by haul? What are you not telling me here? <+++++> This virus -- it...
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead. <+++++> Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there. <+++++> I can see through walls. I could surprise her.
Blame it on my big brother. He was Spec-Recon. And the stories he used to tell... <+++++> If you got a good one, Wick...
 <+++++> I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit! <+++++> I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
No... <+++++> Tommy, Halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them. It's all make believe.
Oh dear, why is life so complicated? Sometimes I really wish I could be someone else. <+++++> That's a good idea, sire.
Routine. <+++++> Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
It's okay. <+++++> Well, nobody asked me what I thought. They just hung it on me.
Have it your way. The point is-- <+++++> It's your roll--
Kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before? <+++++> Simulated one.
Yeah. <+++++> I used to think about it. I had Margaret. She wanted kids. I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.
He's a boxer. A flyweight. <+++++> Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
Which was his room? <+++++> Number ten.
It's in front of us. <+++++> Do you think it's a dog?
And he used to fuck a Playboy centerfold every night. <+++++> Twice a night, sometimes.
Well... <+++++> No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
Joe, I can't look at you any more. <+++++> Nobody asked you to.
It could. Yes. <+++++> Then I shall make use of this starship.
You think they are confidential? I don't know anything about how this town works, I haven't lived here a year yet. <+++++> We need a sympathetic face.
Wait, don't hang up. <+++++> Okay?
Anderson. Jack W. Donald M.  I'm sorry. No Lisa. <+++++> Did you check all four years?
Anything wrong? <+++++> No. I don't think so.
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers. <+++++> Flowers! What flowers?
Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document? <+++++> Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it!
No chance of that. <+++++> Not much.
It's Skip, for you. <+++++> Yeah, Skip, it's me. Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...
Three days, that's for the bourgeois - I see a midnight elopement, waking up a village person... <+++++> What are you going to wear?
What's the matter with you? <+++++> He's looking right at me.
Three to six hours. <+++++> I'll just boost the doses.
Lose the hardware now. <+++++> We'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish. <+++++> And for you --
I finished that. I'm just messing around. <+++++> Tanks, huh?
Don't I, Norman? YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE. Of a woman you killed! <+++++> I did NOT! I did not kill anyone. Jesus. Claire, listen to me. I walked in and she was lying there dead.
Joey? <+++++> Not quite.
Blank faces here, O'Neil. <+++++> Quick-hit technique used by Capone. Rigged a getaway car with running boards and handles. All his guys had to do was jump on and take a ride.
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot. <+++++> Give me my book.
Keep looking. <+++++> What're we looking for?
You forgot this. <+++++> Thanks.
I still am. <+++++> In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable? <+++++> Unreasonable! Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
 <+++++> I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side. <+++++> I demand action.
Oskar - my friend Lena. <+++++> How do you do? What can I get you, what're you drinking?
Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ... <+++++> Double-meaning intended, right?
Where are you? <+++++> I'm everywhere.
Excuse me? <+++++> Who's been talking to you about what I'm feeling? Who should care about what I'm feeling?
You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news? <+++++> Give me the bad news.
Charm. <+++++> Uh huh. Look, Nero. I'll make you an offer. Take her. Right now.
We can't think of them just as housewives -- but as allies. And we've got to treat them as such. <+++++> Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
What? Really? <+++++> Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
Look. I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry. The price is now the whole amount. We want the entire eighty thousand. <+++++> Oh, for Chrissakes here -
Do you ever regret things you've done? <+++++> Everyone regrets something.
It doesn't mention 'females only' <+++++> I really don't know what to say
What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos? <+++++> He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
Have you been up all night again? <+++++> Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing? <+++++> Oh, nothing much. You know...
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die? <+++++> Oh, sure.
I believe he is probably lying. <+++++> Through his ass.
Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction. <+++++> Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person.
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money... <+++++> If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned. <+++++> But...
You draw very well. <+++++> Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him. <+++++> Why were you given notice?
Âex-tanker who's walking on his heelsÂ ? <+++++> Don't say that!
Ah, your psychotic is here. <+++++> Not today...
What's your name? <+++++> Claudia.
At school. It's Thursday. <+++++> Oh, I forgot.
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything. <+++++> Oh... great!
Your insight is enlightening. <+++++> No wisdom, no insight, no plan.
A rich actress. <+++++> Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
I'm in pain. <+++++> You want to see pain? Swing by First Methodist Tuesday nights. See the guys with testicular cancer. That's pain.
Good. Making progress. <+++++> Honey, can we talk tonight? You know, about stuff?
Yeah? <+++++> They never made it off the planet. The parasites won.
What did you expect? <+++++> Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
You dumb jarhead motherf-- <+++++> Chill out, Lindsey! !
You let me make a fool of myself. <+++++> You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?
Also known as Madman Mundt. <+++++> He's a little funny in the head.
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana? <+++++> Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million! <+++++> Imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou! Think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages!
How wonderful, darling. What does that mean for you? <+++++> I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Why are we here? <+++++> She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her.
GUARD!! ! <+++++> Ash... Ashley...
Dad's disappeared! <+++++> He was there and then he wasn't!
More like deployed in bed asleep. <+++++> I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
Look, Dick, I don't - <+++++> No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all.
So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America. <+++++> What do you mean, "in no time"?
I was just thinking of... the noise. <+++++> I like the noise.
Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian. <+++++> OK, but be careful.
And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament? <+++++> Well, sir, like I said, for the same reasons we do.
Me? <+++++> Absolutely.
Food, moron. <+++++> Thank you, Keeper.
Is this what it's like to love somebody? <+++++> You disappointed?
In a way... <+++++> I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
I am, Commander Riker...  May I touch your hair? <+++++> Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance.
I'll do that. <+++++> We're outta here.
I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out! <+++++> What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
Take this back with you. Deliver it safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal. <+++++> That's crazy. My husband is on trial for smuggling.
Who's asking? <+++++> Where can we talk?
There's a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action... <+++++> Indeed, sir, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good shape as we are, what with the rebellion and all...
I don't know nothin'! <+++++> The summer is young yet, little lad. Pearl?
And he loves you back, doesn't he? <+++++> He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
Straight-A brainiac! <+++++> Could you guys possibly cool that for a - -
Mike, good to see you. Got everything you want? <+++++> Thanks.
--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?-- <+++++> --let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me. <+++++> How about "later?"
They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it. <+++++> What was the money for?
Good-bye Peter. <+++++> No! Wait! !
What? <+++++> You know, Stephen Foster. "Oh, Susanna". "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!
I'm not sorry. <+++++> I'm going to leave you.
...he wants to testify...? <+++++> It looks that way.
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it? <+++++> I hope itÂs not too significant.
I admire them. <+++++> I do, too.
Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital. <+++++> Property.
Hello, Sam. <+++++> Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
So long. <+++++> Hey, wait a minute. You got change comin'.
Why do you do that? <+++++> What?
You're a regular god damn acrobat, aren't you? Bet you feel real good makin' me look like an asshole. <+++++> It was not my intent --
What? <+++++> He's a podiatrist. Pain is your body's way of telling you something is wrong. Your toe is trying to tell you not to do it.
Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe? <+++++> Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong. <+++++> But Richard, no, I, I --
Yeah, uh, just a minute <+++++> Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
Then why are you putting on mascara? <+++++> I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
So who's the Guv? Who we doing this for? <+++++> You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.
Sorry, ma'am. We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle. <+++++> I know Dottie!
Yeah, no shit. <+++++> As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders? <+++++> Yeah.
Yes, what? <+++++> Yes, I'll have dinner with you.
Boyfriend? <+++++> Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend.
What? <+++++> I never knew you, Dad.
Yes. <+++++> Why...?
This is baloney! <+++++> He superimposed your head onto "Scarface."
I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen. <+++++> If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting. <+++++> Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that. Not to worry.
I had a teacher like that once. <+++++> Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving. Now why don't you use that character...
What's going on? Who started this? <+++++> You mean who hit who?
The plane is fine. <+++++> Is it you?
Hey man. <+++++> We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine. <+++++> Baron!
Terry, no, no... . <+++++> Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me. Call the Father.
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this. <+++++> Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit.
Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once. Sold Lady Kenmores--it's nasty, nasty work. <+++++> Even if it's the Carolina League-- this is a chance to play everyday.
He fell. He falls. <+++++> He must have taken quite a fall.
I called your room from downstairs. <+++++> If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
Anything I can do back here? <+++++> No.
I'm not so sure. Look again in three months. <+++++> It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
We're outnumbered twenty to one. <+++++> It's suicide.
You buy this "blurry" business? <+++++> Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?
Okay. <+++++> Manhattans? This time of night?
What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ? <+++++> It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows, Memphis. You know that.
Mojitas...? <+++++> Later! Do you dance?
No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here! <+++++> Oh, let me go, will you!
Here, have a sandwich. <+++++> Fuck you.
I would start with cocktails. <+++++> Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
That's quite a story. <+++++> Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you? The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too.
You sure this will work? <+++++> Not sure at all.
Norman, please! Don't! <+++++> Pull it, damn it!
How do you know? <+++++> I heard it on the radio. We gotta get our asses into Mexico tonight.
You want a Dairy Queen? <+++++> No way. I'm about to blow up.
What did you think? <+++++> Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi. <+++++> Go learn something.
But I insist. <+++++> I have to go.
I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change. <+++++> I bet you did lots of bad things.
Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward. <+++++> No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.
Katrina. Why do you follow? <+++++> I apologize if I worried you.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll-- <+++++> Two-hundred.
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche. <+++++> Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
Hello? <+++++> Do you still want to do something tonight?
Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms? <+++++> Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.
You're fired. <+++++> I know. Do come and meet your guest.
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening! <+++++> Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
NO... For God's sakes, Santos! <+++++> Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room. <+++++> What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
For a while. <+++++> How's she doing?
Are there many windows? <+++++> Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
My ballet recital. <+++++> Dad!
Aye-aye, captain. <+++++> And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them? <+++++> Saw something I didn't like.
Why did you do that, Billy? <+++++> You think that caused the accident, Risa? That it brought bad luck?
Really? Bulimic headcase. <+++++> What a loser she must be. Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do. <+++++> What? He's going to be all right!
I think I'm a werewolf. <+++++> Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf?
What the hell... <+++++> Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
What do you think? <+++++> I think you just like to eat dirt.
 <+++++> What do you mean lied about who you are?
The Gods are asleep, Erik. <+++++> I will go and wake them up!
What ... What must I decide? <+++++> You've got to change occupations, Hacene. Right away!
Oh, is that it! <+++++> Yeah, you know.
Yes. <+++++> Flares?
You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us. <+++++> You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff <+++++> I paid for those guitar cases.
That's no good. I like to work on the outside. I must have something easy. <+++++> Then you don't wanna work hard?
Who are you working for? <+++++> I'm self employed. What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have Â£31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle. <+++++> Oh my God, a mistake!
No. I took a year off to be with you. Of course I care. Don't get angry. What? <+++++> How did you know --
They're inured to it. <+++++> You think so?
I hope so <+++++> You will.
Over this? <+++++> Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right? <+++++> What do you mean?
I didn't give you away the first time. <+++++> And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck.
Or maybe because of what we did to them. It doesn't matter. It's a perfect system now, isn't it? <+++++> I'm not a murderer. I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape. <+++++> That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?
I'll put one on the notice-board too. <+++++> Am I invited?
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing. <+++++> Oh, that's nice.
What do you think happened? <+++++> I don't know! Maybe it was her... boyfriend. I passed out. I don't know. Won't the police be able to Â
Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card. <+++++> You want a drink?
Heh heh. Fire. Heh heh Aaaaeeehhhhg!! ! <+++++> What's your problem Beavis?
She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that? <+++++> She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America. <+++++> Well?
Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this. <+++++> Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB. He's smart, Gregor is.
What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts. <+++++> But, Your Majesty -
He's going to be the pastor? <+++++> Yep. I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
Stan! <+++++> Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband. <+++++> It's late.
Going north? <+++++> You bet your raggedy white ass I am.
I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory. <+++++> And he sent you to me?
Well there....  What's the difference? <+++++> Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
...we're not... <+++++> You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
Surely you've seen a man naked. <+++++> It's only been described to me. In your books.
Yes. <+++++> --And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
Where were you the day he died? <+++++> At a horse show.
WAKE UP! <+++++> Fuck! My money!
No! <+++++> Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
Rose, please go away. <+++++> Lila, I want to help you.
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel. <+++++> Oh, How'd she get back?
Yeah, long time ago. I know you? <+++++> I look familiar?
Is your time so empty? <+++++> Oh, no!
Let's do it. <+++++> I'm your soldier.
Darling... <+++++> Well, if you will excuse me. Madame. What a pleasure.
When can I squeeze one out? <+++++> Not until like... eighth grade.
Can I ask you something? <+++++> Shoot.
If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter. <+++++> He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute.
Get off me! <+++++> Will you calm down?
Hello. <+++++> Chloe?
What are we delivering? <+++++> We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
What do you get if you finish? <+++++> Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing... <+++++> If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
Which... <+++++> "Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
They didn't get my contracts. <+++++> They--excuse me...
So there's one around here. <+++++> Not necessarily. These wounds could've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, or more. None of them are immediately fatal.
What are you doing fooling around in here? <+++++> Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.
Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here. <+++++> Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
Thank you. <+++++> I was really very moved by the way you...
They won't talk to you. <+++++> Are they on the phone still?
What are you thinking? <+++++> Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.
Where you gonna be? <+++++> Right here. Be here all afternoon. You ready for this?
Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today. That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too. <+++++> Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear. You have my sincere word...
Inigo. <+++++> What?
Thank you, Thomas. <+++++> For what?
Yeah. <+++++> What would your girlfriend think of that?
...can we have a white one...? <+++++> Can we have a white one, please...
We don't want any.... <+++++> Hello? Thea who? I know it's Thea Brody. How many grandchildren do I have? I know you can use the phone by yourself.
Then what? That's it. That's all I got. <+++++> Nothing on Hannah?
Dear heart, I love you. <+++++> We had the best organization that black people ever had and niggers ruined it.
Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere? <+++++> They are everywhere!
Splendid! <+++++> Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
I'm shocked. <+++++> Yeah. You know Harry.
"Abuse" the copy machine. There's an image. <+++++> Pretend you're me. You find this. What would you do?
Do you have an agent, Stanley? <+++++> No.
Are you gentlemen all through with me? <+++++> Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you.
Oh, no, no, no. <+++++> You're unbelievable.
Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards? <+++++> You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them? Peace in the family.
No. <+++++> Where were you?
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed. <+++++> Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
How do you mean, start? <+++++> Call him.
Odessa. <+++++> Why would we go to Odessa?
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not. <+++++> And that was all?
You and I may not meet again for months! <+++++> Months?
You need to get outta here, Rapunzel <+++++> That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
Well, good. Good for you. <+++++> Anyway, that's why I came by. I need to fix this button. Do you have a needle and thread?
He heard. <+++++> But I got two hundred and fifty coming. It's my share. Jimmy owes me.
Go in there and lick his attitude. <+++++> The antibiotics weren't working. It's what I believe, George.
Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you? <+++++> I'm just stopping by to say hello.
Take us up. <+++++> Up one kilometer, Jay.
This is Bishop. <+++++> <i>The Bounty Hunters have arrived.
Neo! <+++++> What the hell just happened?
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters? <+++++> No. Not at all. It's nice.
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore. <+++++> ... Oh? Robert, take a look, would you?
Thank you, Bloom. I knew I could con you. <+++++> Oh, it's all right ... wha?
Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment. <+++++> You've got something going?
Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio. <+++++> Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.
No shit. <+++++> None whatsoever.
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice. <+++++> Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG. <+++++> WISH HE WAS MINE. THAT HANDSOME BOY OVER THERE, THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR.
How'd you find me? <+++++> Helen, she sent along your things with a note, and John here, he wrote to the police.
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run. <+++++> But you look like you been in a train wreck, how'd he just drive away?
You know Dmitri? <+++++> 'Fraid so.
I can't. I have to know. <+++++> Please --
I never knew. <+++++> Will never told you that? Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
 <+++++> They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia. The President can bomb anybody he wants.
Could this be that boy? <+++++> Dallas? Could be. He doesn't look like a reefer smoker...
Of course not. Who wants to? WhatÂs the point if we donÂt get caught? WhereÂs the glamour in that? <+++++> The way I see it. WeÂll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal.
I'm going to my desk. <+++++> You're not goin' anywhere! Get on the fuckin' floor!
Yes. <+++++> Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket? Lost everyone on board. In fair weather no less.
Ouch! ! <+++++> Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough? <+++++> No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
Oh, that's nice... <+++++> May I come in?
... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress... <+++++> We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
Nope. <+++++> What do you think's going on?
They beg you to consider the future. What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish! ? <+++++> What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
Did you pick up the car? <+++++> It is waiting for you in the garage.
I... <i>love...</i> Pat Benatar. <+++++> Yeah?! Well... I loved her too.
Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice. <+++++> Yeah Â- sure.
Dewey, you and I would never make it. <+++++> Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
No kiddin'. What's your idea? <+++++> 
The coat? A guy I did a favor once gave it to me. Christ. <+++++> Who'd you ever do a favor for? You just let some poor bastard freeze to death, wouldn't you?
Fuck no. <+++++> I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm !
He's pretty! <+++++> Okay! I wasn't sure
Look, I can be selfish, I know that. I'm not blind to my own failings... <+++++> Noooo, please...
You don't think I had anything to do with it? <+++++> Where were you?
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o. 'd if you don't catch my acting debut. <+++++> Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
If you'll just be patient, I can work things out. <+++++> I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently. <+++++> Nuts. She only cares about the money. She thinks I'll make you cut her out of the w-w-w-w...  will.
Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world. Ooh, hey, I gotta run. <+++++> Look, uh, I was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime.
Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh? <+++++> For starters.
It's hard to describe. <+++++> Try.
That's close enough, Major. <+++++> But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
I can take care of myself. You know that. <+++++> I know...I know.
Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song. <+++++> She sings too?
Who? <+++++> Me.
Yeah, there was apple juice. <+++++> Was there Burger King?
You have a question for Helmuth, David? <+++++> Yes. What was the orchestra's reaction when they asked you to play for Hitler's birthday?
...I don't know. <+++++> You think I'm a freak?
She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it! <+++++> As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I. You'll have to admit she had four husbands. <+++++> Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
The past? <+++++> Sometimes.
My man is deaf. I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY! Neh. <+++++> Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's.
Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you. <+++++> Okay.
What do I do when I'm around someone I know? <+++++> You use your sleeve.
You couldn't? <+++++> Well I'm sort of involved.
I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment. <+++++> Of course it was. Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.
Maybe I died already. Look at my face. <+++++> You need to lighten up.
Hi. <+++++> Hi.
I won't. You interested? <+++++> Maybe.
Come on, man. I almost had this thing open. <+++++> You ever think about it? You ever worry?
"Here," wh-wh-what? <+++++> My jacket. Take it 'cause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it.
Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain. <+++++> Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.
I miss you, Annie. <+++++> I know. We miss you too.
Can you make out any pattern in all that? <+++++> Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive. <+++++> I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
This looks corny. <+++++> Go wash glasses if you don't like it.
You're not the Mayor. <+++++> Things change. Hey, good to meet you. We'll be working hand in glove in Gotham's glorious future.
I thought you were going to the mixer? <+++++> I had to change. Did anyone call?
Where the hell am I going to go? <+++++> John, you have to throw the keys up to me.
Hey, how much are we ahead? <+++++> Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Paper. <+++++> It's a fortune box.
Annie made them. <+++++> Who's Annie?
There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us. <+++++> But that's what happened before.
Except the servicemen. <+++++> Naturally.
You live like a pig. <+++++> Yeah. How long have you been here?
I'm sorry. <+++++> Me too.
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you. <+++++> My pleasure. I'm Orson Welles.
Um, hi? <+++++> Leah just told me you were going with her.
Yes. Is Molly there? <+++++> My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air.
About what? <+++++> You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice. You can run from marriage, but not your parents. <+++++> They forced me to marry!
Anything? <+++++> Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
Thank you Mrs. Franklin. Jackie? This has been very valuable for us. And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight. <+++++> It's Wednesday night. She's at my house. I'll talk to her.
Is this for real? Like for real, for real? <+++++> Unfortunately, yes.
I don't know what you're talking about. <+++++> I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
The hospital? <+++++> Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in.
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey. <+++++> Go.
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then? <+++++> Five.
Can't say that I have. Can't say I've heard of a lot of people though. <+++++> If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie. See if his name's on it. How about it, Harry?
You meet those friends of yours in jail too? <+++++> Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.
What are you doing? <+++++> I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
Not yet. I had a phlemless morning. I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer. <+++++> This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
Georgia. <+++++> Hi....what....what's up....?
I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men. <+++++> Ned is wrong for it.
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess. <+++++> What about relatives?
What are you doing? <+++++> I was thinking about killing myself.
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince. <+++++> What was that?
Why did you come here? <+++++> So that others would know about this place?
You're the Indian FBI. <+++++> That's right. Turn around.
Why don't you run on home while the evening's young. <+++++> Home. Jesus. I'm like this. Home!
Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the... Oh, stay back! <+++++> All I'm askin' is...
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up. <+++++> No. She really liked you.
Maybe he did. <+++++> We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
Almost three. <+++++> Is this it?
Half watch dog? <+++++> Yeh, he's only got one eye.
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet. <+++++> The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
Your guests, ma'am? <+++++> Yes, in a way. I'm the Doctor's social secretary. I handle his correspondence, send out the invitations, you know.
Judge must have money riding on the championship. <+++++> Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the mound. All I know is when this season's over Camp 8's gonna have pork chops.
At the party. <+++++> Toward the end. You remember?
Henry, the pen -- <+++++> What?
Mary Clarence, are you with us? <+++++> Um, I don't really know this one...
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I <+++++> Craig is one syllable
No, no, not tonight. Don't let her in here. I have too much to do. <+++++> Yes, sir. I'll talk to Helms, and, uh ... what's our press position on this Watergate thing?
We'll have to make the first drop at 7. As soon as they pick up the money, we've got Âem. <+++++> And Mr. Lee? Where is he?
There's no one here. <+++++> Just listen. You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan--
...Is that not true? <+++++> Who's writing this guy's lines?
Are you ready in there, feature attraction? <+++++> Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me. <+++++> Why are you so anxious?
Such the flirt. <+++++> U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing. <+++++> You asshole.
He came in through the cupboard. <+++++> You little liar! Get out of here!
I have come to commission work from you. <+++++> What work?
Any particular reason? <+++++> We can't stay here.
Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married. <+++++> Oh. When did you move back?
English. <+++++> I spend a lot of time on e-Bay.
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go. We are having a guest for breakfast. <+++++> I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem. <+++++> Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush. <+++++> Happy to see you looking so good.
Oh, what?... your servant, sir. <+++++> And I am his.
When? <+++++> At seven-thirty?
I love you, Adam. <+++++> Yes, you told me.
What's your name? <+++++> Alexander.
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here. <+++++> No porters here! !
Calm down, Clay. Just calm down. We'll watch it. <+++++> Good. Fine.
You pitch, baby; I'll ketch. <+++++> The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere.
Can't do it with both hands? <+++++> No, Sir.
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone. <+++++> Ah. Italian?
We ain't taking him to a hospital. <+++++> If we don't, he'll die.
Are you okay? <+++++> I think so. I was just taking a shower.
Andy? <+++++> Hi George!
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over. <+++++> Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
OK, we forget the blackmail. *You* killed him. How come? <+++++> He and Doris... were having an affair.
The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia -- <+++++> He didn't mess up. There it is ...
You don't understand anything. <+++++> I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine.
Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money. <+++++> That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.
My instinct was to not get electrocuted. <+++++> How old are you, son?
I feel fine. <+++++> Do me a favour.
Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up. <+++++> Who's in command?
Next waterhole's Black Draw. We Could be there by mid-morning. <+++++> They're wise by now. Which is Next, Iron Springs? Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs.
Uh-uh. <+++++> S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
 <+++++> Oh, that's so interesting!
But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless. It went beyond that... <+++++> Okay. Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing...
Nonsense. You're a fey creature with mad ideas. But you have a wildness that holds me to you, lass. <+++++> No great lady will ever take my place?
It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth. <+++++> Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un hmmm.
This is stupid. <+++++> It's better than doing nothing.
...who say...? <+++++> The government says. Mama has lost her job, so she can't be your foster mother. The police found a marijuana cigarette in your home.
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones. <+++++> Only in your bones?
Mr. Doyle. <+++++> Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea. <+++++> Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
All right. One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey. <+++++> I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.
That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg. But that's where you come in. <+++++> You want me to front for you.
What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh? <+++++> Get outta here.
I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit? <+++++> Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time.
Is that right? <+++++> It's been known to happen.
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else. <+++++> We_re not all running away
This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here-- <+++++> I don't know what it's called.
What's his rent? <+++++> Thirty a month.
Murder, uh? <+++++> Hanging an innocent man to win an election!
Till they kill you. Yeah. <+++++> Then why bother curing me?
You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset. <+++++> Upset? Why should I be upset?
What have you got there, Lenny? <+++++> We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach.
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and -- <+++++> Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it. <+++++> I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes? <+++++> How did you know? !
I think I'm mixed up in something. <+++++> <i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free? <+++++> That's the deal.
I hate her! <+++++> We all do. Now let's go.
I meant Sally. <+++++> I meant Sally.
November, I thought. <+++++> Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
You better take off. <+++++> Ain't you coming with us, sweet thing?
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out. <+++++> You did, huh? Good for you.
Braddock -- Braddock? <+++++> Yes, but I'm afraid --
I'm okay. It's going well! <+++++> 'Have a look?
Medford rum! Ah, a breath of the Promised Land! To the champion of the Iron Horseshoe, Jabez Stone! <+++++> Thanks, Mr. Webster! To the champion of the whole United States -- Dan'l Webster!
Look -  This pose is all wrong! <+++++> I'll pose any way you want.
And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable. <+++++> I'm sure you'll figure it out.
The thing is...it really can't wait. <+++++> My name's Neil. Maybe I can help you.
We'll worry about that when we get there. <+++++> I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
I've tried to warn you. Scientists are always pawns of the military -- <+++++> Starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years, I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event.
Properly arranged, yes. <+++++> These are odds of 8 to 1.
How? <+++++> With a knife. I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes.
A car. <+++++> Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him? <+++++> Too kinky.
I can't.... <+++++> Yes you can....
Beer okay? <+++++> Yeah, thanks.
I remember that dress. <+++++> Rosalie Testa!
That's all right, really, thank you. <+++++> All right, hell, you trying to work and me carrying on in there. Look, the liquor's good, wuddya say?
Gallon or two? <+++++> Well, looks like we done it this time awright!
Caitlin Bree. Yeah? <+++++> I'm her sister.
I'm starting to forget her. <+++++> I know. But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you. And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
My bed. <+++++> What else?
You like this house, Max? <+++++> M'hm.
This is totally irrelevant. <+++++> Oh, but it's not.
Gun shot. <+++++> Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
...What? <+++++> There's something I have to tell you...
Will she pick me up after school? <+++++> No. If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
Still playing by the rules. You're a damn good kiler. <+++++> How's the pain?
Sure! Comedy! Make jokes about the traffic. Do impressions. Maybe a little blue material... <+++++> I don't swear. I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
Why not? <+++++> I'm in love with you!
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not? <+++++> Oh, no, no, no.
Who used to say that? <+++++> In school.
What in the hell do you think you're doing? Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace. <+++++> You think you're going to catch him on a trace? Everything he does is planned out well in advance.
You bitch! You were in on it froom the start! <+++++> Shut up! The both of you. Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.
Why are you taking that? <+++++> I'm stealing it.
Henry Hill. <+++++> *Henry Hill? * That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
How? <+++++> It'll be something hokey.
Shut down accelerators. <+++++> Accelerators down.
Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy? <+++++> Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
Who use to own it? <+++++> Russia.
Yes? <+++++> Benjamin Braddock.
No. I think it's fucked. <+++++> 
I know where the money is. <+++++> If you knew, you would have it with you.
Did you tell her that you loved her? <+++++> Like. Like. Never love. Love is for low-level virgin seduction guys.
Please ... don't do this ... <+++++> Answer the fucking question!
Please. It won't happen again. <+++++> No, thank you. I'll walk.
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right? <+++++> No, not exactly.
Thank you so much. <+++++> Is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? Have you no human consideration?
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off... <+++++> Picking up magnetic interference.
So what the hell's Mutt been up to? <+++++> Actually I don't really know Mutt.
The what? <+++++> Hunter Killers. Patrol machines. Build in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up, put in camps...for orderly disposal.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or -- <+++++> What in the world would give me that idea?
Where the Christ do you think you're going? <+++++> I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
I've seen a lot, Max. <+++++> So've I. Too much.
Oh, that's tasty. <+++++> 100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
By who? <+++++> His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself.
We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse. <+++++> A nurse? Well, sure, a nurse is great. A nurse? Great.
Rough day? <+++++> Rough life, Jack.
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you? <+++++> No.
So talk to me tomorrow. After the gig. <+++++> We don't get a gig.
Guilt? <+++++> If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
Where are you going? <+++++> Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom.
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills. <+++++> And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Except Mark of course. <+++++> What's that supposed to mean?
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again. <+++++> You get her those Vitamin E right away.
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you. <+++++> Peter I love you too but...
What's your new book called? <+++++> I don't have a title yet.
Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous... <+++++> I'm not-
What happens when a man climbs through his own portal? <+++++> How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
What happened? <+++++> Workin' a saw mill. Here's to.
And that's where you met Oswald for the first time? <+++++> Yeah, strange guy. Dave introduced him as...
Can you locate them? <+++++> The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. You see -- <+++++> Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
Samhain. <+++++> And I'm its deliverer. Its calling card, if you will. I follow it. Protect it. Act as its guardian.
Where's Sean? <+++++> He's got piano lessons.
Keep your voice down. <+++++> Even if you don't, Her Security men will.
Shit. Here we go again. <+++++> Didn't you see her this morning?
And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program? <+++++> Paul said he'd call the school. And your father thinks he's convinced the guard not to press charges as long as you get help.
It's gone now. <+++++> Where are we?
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is? <+++++> That's like a stag film.
Not enough. We're out numbered and out gunned. They'd cut us to shreds. <+++++> So good bye, Shi'ites. Thanks for playing. We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem. <+++++> What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!
Face it, Z, we're lost! We must have walked halfway across the world by now! How did I get into this mess... <+++++> Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar. The night we danced.
I told you, I just got change. <+++++> Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough? <+++++> I didn't mean to --
Well, a ball player. <+++++> No, I know. But, what if you don't make it?
This isn't doctor's orders. It's mine. I'm saying you can't come. <+++++> Why not?
Caught him off Cape Hatteras. <+++++> What is it?
Got a job for me? <+++++> Yeah, we'll find something for you. Shoveling shark shit or something.
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you... <+++++> Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
I'm afraid you're blocking my view. <+++++> Sorry. Which view would you like?
I might understand that. <+++++> Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
To feel it, to know it, is to be in touch with the will of every living thing. <+++++> I do not think I like the sound of that.
Hey, I'm Sooze. <+++++> Yeah, right, publicist.
He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up. <+++++> Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
They have less power over you if you look into my eyes. <+++++> Huh?
That's thirty percent. <+++++> For two lonely nights.
Hear what? <+++++> Get away from me!
It gets done now or not at all. Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them. <+++++> Forgive my intrusion into your affairs, but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job, his agent, if you will.
A dog pissed on me!! I'm gonna sue you for this! You violated my civil rights! <+++++> Your civil rights?! You tried to rob me! I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.
... I'm not sleeping well... <+++++> ... Doctor Crusher has something that'll take care of that...
I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor. <+++++> Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home. I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
Get them back -- <+++++> I'm trying, goddammit --
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here -- <+++++> I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
You don't have to say that. <+++++> I never say anything I have to.
Morning! Who's that little old man? <+++++> It's Paul's grandfather.
Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very much. <+++++> I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here! <+++++> Judy, you've got to do this for me! Please!
Did you play ARCADE last night? <+++++> Actually, no. I was just telling Nick, here, that my t.v. 's busted...
Mm - Hmmm... <+++++> Tell you what. How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
You know... a couple of queers. <+++++> Do you believe this fucking girl?
* Thank you. * <+++++> Fuck you; I gave you a reason to live and		   * you were more than happy to help. You lie		   * to yourself!
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you! <+++++> They'll have me. Teach them. Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning.
You're going to live. <+++++> I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future.
I don't under-- <+++++> The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
It was? <+++++> Yes! This was how I could be put out of the Senate and out of the way! They even *promised* me that if I--
You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er...  ... scent. <+++++> Of course.
You don't? <+++++> No. What is happening?
You're using your son's name. <+++++> No. Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to. When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it.
LaMagra -- <+++++> That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind.
See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise.... <+++++> You want me to move?
I can't, Andy. <+++++> Then, why don't you just die. I'm going.
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up! <+++++> You killed him...
I don't think so. <+++++> Are you okay? ?
That never would of -- <+++++> Let's cut the bullshit.
She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class. <+++++> I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act.
I wouldn't miss this boat for a million. <+++++> She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful.
Play? <+++++> Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
Hello! It's Anchorage! Gotcha! <+++++> Sorry, that's the largest city.
Ellis, what have you told them? <+++++> I told them we're old friends and you were my guest at the party.
She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it. <+++++> I made that table for you and Annette, for your wedding. I put a lot of love into it.
How'd you people happen to pop in? <+++++> 
He who is not with us is against us. <+++++> Those are the words of a broken spirit. My spirit is whole.
-- which is a hack. <+++++> The man we know and love.
And what do you tell yourself now? <+++++> Nothing. It's over.
I can explain-- <+++++> Sure! You're never at a loss for words.
Wouldn't miss it. <+++++> How are we doing?
So you'll get married in a new dress. <+++++> It's a sign.
 <+++++> INT. TUNNEL/AIR VENT - DAY.
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground. <+++++> And because the dead walked.
I think it's too late for changes, Michael. I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it. <+++++> Why too late?
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party? <+++++> Will do.
See my nipples? <+++++> Yes.
Something you probably wouldn't understand. When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege. <+++++> You were taken for a buggy ride?
What the hell was all that about? <+++++> What the hell do you think it was about? There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
I know you do. <+++++> And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
Oh, let Henslowe wait. <+++++> Mr. Henslowe?
I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud. <+++++> Sure.
Nix, the law! <+++++> Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled <u>against</u> an object. Rather than the reverse, yes? <+++++> Obviously.
How did you come to that conclusion? <+++++> My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman. He's seen it 13 times...
Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying. There's too much heat on Carl. <+++++> Please. Tell me who Carl sells to.
Whose word? <+++++> His Word.
I am. I'm here. <+++++> YOU HAVE TO!
It's over! <+++++> What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls. <+++++> I'm from a small town too, you know.
I see. And where did you drive? <+++++> We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
That's a freakin' fact. Least of all us. <+++++> Just drive. He'll get out of our way.
 <+++++> You may not <u>win</u> them.
Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before. <+++++> Yes. He's a very careful driver.
It's alright for a man to cry once in awhile. Just don't make a habit of it. <+++++> Hey, Willie, what was Claude's plan, anyway?
They changed Franklin's portrait. <+++++> You think it's a conspiracy?
Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade. <+++++> Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.
If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him. <+++++> We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families.
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that. <+++++> Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk? <+++++> Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
What do you want? <+++++> I want romance.
Yes, Mikey? <+++++> Do you have any brothers or sisters?
Guess so. <+++++> So why don't you take a deep breath, Jake, and I'll count to ten. One. Two. Three...
Satisfied? <+++++> You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
Just relax.... <+++++> Honest, I feel fine. You better be married.
Sure. <+++++> But... You may not be well enough.
Where's Shane? <+++++> Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
Sure you did. So come on. Say what you think. <+++++> Waitress! Four beers!
Damn diesel injections are flood-... <+++++> Excuse me...
It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not? ! <+++++> BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!
When I was with Webb. And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living? How can you delude yours... <+++++> I've got the check...
Jade Fox must die at its edge. Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl? <+++++> My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone. I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
I though you said we didn't have a drop. <+++++> I found a doner.
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me. <+++++> I don't understand.
Blast it, I'm already awake! <+++++> I know. That was for the smell.
Yes. We lost five. <+++++> You were lucky. I lost thirty there.
Thanks. <+++++> Welcome, Howard.
No. Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy. <+++++> Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes-- <+++++> What does he see?
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever. <+++++> Fine.
I'm tired of praying. <+++++> That's enough, Brother Earl.
You cannot do this. I am a man of God! <+++++> Climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find, Father. That is the closest you ever come to God.
Don't annoy me, Travis. <+++++> No, Sir.
I say it because it's descriptive. <+++++> Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals? <+++++> I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way. <+++++> Fenster and Hockney?
The number. <+++++> What?
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time? <+++++> She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet. Oh, I adored her. I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.
Sure--  You know something? I have a feeling we're going to stay here. <+++++> And listen--watch out about the pals you choose--Know what I mean? Don't let them choose you--
It's you who count, but don't get me wrong - I don't intend to let you break your neck again! <+++++> J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time. <+++++> You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs. <+++++> How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose?
Mr. Parker. <+++++> Hi, Professor. What's up?
Shall I wash these out? <+++++> Yeah, we'd better keep them for now, I'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night.
He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet. <+++++> Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing! Something is happening . . .. <+++++> Yes. To all of us.
What are you going to do about it? <+++++> What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
How're you doing? Looking lovely as always. <+++++> You ready?
Mm. <+++++> And you just want to ask me a few questions?
Kate. Thank God you're there. I need help. <+++++> Uh huh... Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
I heard it too. <+++++> Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
Thank you very much. <+++++> When one is invited to tea, one must look one's best.
Does that bother you, Bill? I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight. <+++++> He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
It was a mutual decision. <+++++> You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
What else? <+++++> He... I'm trying to think... Nothing, really... He... He said he liked Jack Oakie pictures.
For what... to set me up? She loved me she wouldn't frame me. <+++++> Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere! I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things. <+++++> Lay back, Mack.
I said... France is your enemy. Not ours. <+++++> Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?
Usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't. Anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous. <+++++> Nervous?
You sure? <+++++> I'm fine.
You sure you're down with this? <+++++> Little nervous. Wanna puke.
Hello, Karen. I'm just working. <+++++> Yeah but what are you doing?
Or a tunnel or a bridge... <+++++> Suspicions... nothing but suspicions!... That's the trouble with you!
What about the princess? <+++++> You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help. I must try to find the Crystal.
So now you're saying my mother trapped you? <+++++> I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man.
Will you explain what's going on? <+++++> Patience, lad.
My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here. <+++++> Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
Hit your jets, sir ! <+++++> I can't My legs are gone... Get on the boat...
Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose? <+++++> I cut myself shaving.
The doctor said you were having sex. <+++++> To you? In front of him? With the...
I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out. I was trying to protect you. <+++++> From what?
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know. <+++++> Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth. <+++++> Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching. Y'know. Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.
You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you! <+++++> They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
Quite a spell, I reckon. <+++++> Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things.
Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden. <+++++> But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
Not true. <+++++> Or get eaten alive.
We goin' huntin' again, Daddy ! ? <+++++> You bet we is!
Good night. <+++++> Sleep tight.
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong. <+++++> Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony? <+++++> God, yes. Like silk.
I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it? <+++++> I can't even remember what day it is, man.
Free! <+++++> Free!
That would be difficult to explain. <+++++> I'd like you to try.
No. <+++++> They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
Oh, 'scuse me. <+++++> It's all right. He stays with me all the time.
Shot himself. What for ? <+++++> Beats me -- the sun was too much for him, or the mud. Who knows ?
Pardon me? <+++++> Your desert island top-five.
I feel The Force. <+++++> But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, Luke. You are now most susceptible to the temptations of the dark side.
 <+++++> Really?
No. <+++++> Did you talk to Corey?
Look, snap out of it, will ya? <+++++> Kiss me.
Aye and fond of fresh meat and all. <+++++> No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
What? <+++++> I just had a phone call.
When we find him, he is mine. <+++++> Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
He just wants me to be someone I'm not. <+++++> Who?
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that. <+++++> What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her... <+++++> Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
Thank you. <+++++> I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people.
That will never happen. <+++++> Never say never you always say that. I'll bet daddy's mad at me now.
Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here. <+++++> You do it.
With Salvy, eh? <+++++> I went with Sandy and Vera. Salvy was there. Stop it. I just had a drink, that's all.
No. <+++++> No.
Is that Mrs. Preysing. <+++++> Definitely off.
They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger. What am I going to do about that? <+++++> You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization. That it's all theoretical.
Your 'out.' This came for you. <+++++> My father! He's not - ?
Yes, I wrote it. <+++++> You wrote it.
You fool, what have you done? <+++++> What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me.
Don't ask, baby - huh! How much money you got with you? <+++++> About ten dollars.
They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy. Mama Rose was mindless. I was at the Houmfort when the Houngan brought her mind back. <+++++> You mean Mama Rose was like Mrs. Holland?
Come on in. How about a gin and tonic? <+++++> Tonic will be fine.
Yeah, it's just a coincidence. <+++++> That's right.
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere. War is not a woman's problem. <+++++> It is every woman's problem. Who supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- the husbands? Who...
Queens, New York. <+++++> Whatta ya know. Bayside, born and raised.
To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency. <+++++> So that was it.
No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble. <+++++> He's dead?
I asked for metal, you gave me glass. <+++++> This is not my problem.
Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times. I also found a record of your restraining order. <+++++> That was two years ago. John was still in love with me. He wouldn't leave me alone.
We're going to die. <+++++> Will you shut up already?
Yeah. So you can call me if you need help. <+++++> I got a half a tank. You?
You mean tonight? <+++++> Yeah.
You think that I've put you through an ordeal. My scars run so much deeper than yours. <+++++> What scars?
How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners? <+++++> Quite a while.
What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures? <+++++> New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
A charming term. Now, <u>why him</u>? <+++++> Excuse me?
There's so much I want to say to her, it's all jumbled up in my mind, and I don't want her to misunderstand -- <+++++> Well, you'll just have to <u>make</u> her understand.
Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school. <+++++> Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
Just what is the lowdown on Williams? <+++++> It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.
They are English. They don't understand. <+++++> I wish dawdie was with us.
Very good, sir. <+++++> Yes. Well -- goodnight.
When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is. <+++++> Okay.
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things. <+++++> What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh... <+++++> 
You're impressed with her, aren't you? <+++++> She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
You sure? <+++++> I'm sure.
I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up good this time. Should have never started with this fuckin' broad. <+++++> Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
Who do you see? <+++++> I see my sister.
You serious? <+++++> Sure am.
Meda. Meda. <+++++> What?
Twenty. <+++++> Okay, ten dollars.
Is he on his own? <+++++> Just carrying a bag.
The winds are picking up. <+++++> On my way. Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?
How was that? <+++++> Pretty boring, I guess.
"Love me love me love me... put me on t.v." That's the iconography of rascism, man! <+++++> Rod, I'm not a rascist.
I thought this was practically a done deal -- <+++++> Well now it's undone, okay? Forget Bontecou! Scrub him! I'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer.
No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there! <+++++> Why?
Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do I do if he smells the trap. <+++++> I don't think he'll smell anything - just make sure he takes the check. I've been through this a hundred times.
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years. <+++++> Well, it certainly says you.
Can I have one of your cigarettes? <+++++> You haven't smoked in two years.
Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye. <+++++> All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
Wh-wh-wh-wh... <+++++> Shhh...
I give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. Get you to the kitchen. You need the bathroom, it'll reach. <+++++> What do you want?
You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman. <+++++> Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it.
You've been having strange sex...! <+++++> No, Brett, I...
What's that? What are you up to? Nickie - what is this? <+++++> Looks like a hold-up!
Yes sir! <+++++> Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
Talk to your new girlfriend. <+++++> I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
You've killed your fair share of men. <+++++> If I could go back to farming --
Relax, Wally. He had the shoe and the shoe checks out. <+++++> Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
I met you at my fatherÂs funeral. <+++++> Yes.
Where's Timmy and Buck? <+++++> Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
Why don't you try sitting up? <+++++> Or you could try lying down.
And how much are these? <+++++> Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah. <+++++> I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school.
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime? <+++++> Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
What!? ! <+++++> Try to pay attention.
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card. <+++++> Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
What? You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything? <+++++> Just not my type, I guess.
Why? <+++++> Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
 <+++++> I think we should say some words over the grave.
Yes? <+++++> The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here. <+++++> I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
But no one actually saw him die. <+++++> No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
He didn't leave us. <+++++> You are a resilient man, Mr.
Ordell pick up his bond? <+++++> Same as you. Ten thousand.
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve? <+++++> Well, I have things to do --
I just wanted to call before you left. I'm takin' all these job interviews. So I won't just be a construction worker. <+++++> I never cared about that.
What do they want? <+++++> They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.
Like...? <+++++> Like "three thousand a ki?" That's nice.
God, I hate that bitch. <+++++> Yeah, well you never should have married her then.
Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them. <+++++> They are boys. -- And they're Indian.
Dil! <+++++> Get that thing off me, Fergus --
Yeah? <+++++> When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
Octavius wasn't the murderer type. <+++++> But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
And that is? <+++++> A tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and, thus, influence your perception.
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon. <+++++> I'm not going to strike you. I am going to be as gentle as pie--as lemon meringue pie. You mustn't run away now.
I'm glad Bill's back. <+++++> They'd die without each other.
It's an idea. <+++++> Beth --
And all prints washed off by the river. That's great. This is turning out to be a walk in the park, do you know that? <+++++> Come back?
Yes. It's very good, Eve. <+++++> ... But I've never done...  ... You mean...? When... When... When I do it? ... When I touch myself...?
Nick, we can't just -- <+++++> I said let's go, Charlie.
Why not? <+++++> One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--
Those are priceless sculptures. <+++++> I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house! If it's worth something then sell it!
Fucking great. I invested some money in them. <+++++> You win some, you loose some.
This is Persian, if I'm not mistaken. <+++++> Very good. It's sixth century B.C. Do you like the period?
He's not home, I tell you! <+++++> I wanna see that guy!
What you're asking is impossible! <+++++> I offer you the perfect revolution.
You were in insurance before the war. <+++++> Right. Claims assessor.
Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written. What are you -- a book critic? <+++++> How did they die? Was there an investigation?
Sure am. <+++++> Coming with us? Overman's buying.
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know? <+++++> I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out. <+++++> I'd say you turned out just fine.
He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better. <+++++> How long have you been married?
This is ridiculous! <+++++> Tim!
Got used to my bed. Ain't gonna feel to home out here. <+++++> Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna miss. I'm...  Hell, Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children. The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it. <+++++> There will be more to the prize than that. Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it! I can't just -- "let it go away"! ! <+++++> Claire...
The whole area's being evacuated. <+++++> Well, thank you for your help.
How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car? <+++++> Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
I have rehearsal. <+++++> I have to watch rehearsal.
Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day. <+++++> Maybe I like it where I am.
You like ... left me a card? At the club? <+++++> Right. Right!
What? <+++++> Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
What's the problem? <+++++> Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her. <+++++> Did she have tits like that?
She didn't even know you. . <+++++> I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot. And what if I wanted to see her again?
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives. <+++++> Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call. <+++++> No.... I don't...
We got it together, Jake.... <+++++> Okay...we got it together....
You had me scared on the phone. What's wrong with the baby? <+++++> I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
I bet. What about me? Am I how you imagined? <+++++> Yes.
No... <+++++> You can tell me.
Hi Walter. <+++++> Carla...
How you sound? <+++++> I won't do it anymore.
Happen to know where there's one for sale. <+++++> Well ain't you amazing.
I could take some time off.... <+++++> You're always taking time off....
Time's up. Thank you for the interview. <+++++> So you sat it out, that's what you did?
Harry. <+++++> I'm sorry.
That's not what I mean. Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system. <+++++> She's right.
No, you don't! <+++++> He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.
Didn't I tell ya not to worry? Vic was worried. <+++++> Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again. <+++++> Good, good. I, I hope he does.
Sophie. <+++++> Yes, Mr. Gittes.
Not if you be chaste. Tis an awesome test of virginity. <+++++> I've no fear of failure. Your implications are most unbecoming.
Can I steal you for a minute? <+++++> Only if you promise not to return me.
Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all. <+++++> Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --
This man -- did you see him? <+++++> No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast. <+++++> Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
I hope you're comfortable. <+++++> Yes. I am.
Who is it? <+++++> Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you. <+++++> What?
I don't want you to come anyway. <+++++> What?
Well if there was an article about it I'm sure she did. She was always reading. <+++++> Yes I know, it runs in the family. New book?
So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of "Freaks" and put 'em in this other one, "Mr. Loverboy". <+++++> I can't do it.
Objection. The question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness. <+++++> Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months. I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.
No, not at all. <+++++> Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
The number's unlisted... <+++++> Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
Thank you for this honor, my dear. <+++++> You've been shadowing the family for thirty years. It's only fitting you give one af us away.
Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace. <+++++> We're gonna operate together.
Uh, last night... <+++++> Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason. <+++++> But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
Oh, you're right, I know. It's... well, I was just - <+++++> What? What?
Kinda early for Christmas, Bugs. <+++++> A Jew's gotta let his heart tell him when ta give his presents.
A story. <+++++> Like the one about the frog?
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove? <+++++> Jesus. I'm sorry.
I don't know why--! <+++++> Go on--don't give me that. Someone giving you hard looks?
Is that how you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else? <+++++> Most of them.
We gotta break it open. <+++++> I ain't got a warrant.
What I say is, no. We don't do partners. <+++++> For Christ's sake, why not?
That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit. <+++++> It should work -- theoretically. If it doesn't, the mission's off. The craft's nuclear-powered. Except for your wireless.
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute. <+++++> You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . . <+++++> Just get us to the ship!
Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again. <+++++> I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.

I mean it, Pete... Like THAT! ! <+++++> Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house. <+++++> That's a chance we have to take.
Aren't you going to tell me who you are? <+++++> Oh, Faith. My name's Faith.
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight. <+++++> Okay--I'll be here at eight.
I suppose you're right. <+++++> Of course I am. Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
I have the permit. <+++++> After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then? <+++++> Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
Looks like a lot of cactus to me. <+++++> Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is. <+++++> Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
I--I started walking toward it--and there was a bus outside-- and--well--I--I just naturally got aboard-- <+++++> Most natural thing in the world!
<i>He killed two children.</i> <+++++> Fella takes out two kids and has the audacity to not show up for trial.
I feel like I got you into this. <+++++> Forget it.
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see. <+++++> Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
The hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable... <+++++> So?
How do I know you were gonna show us one? <+++++> You're such a baby.
WAIT A MINUTE! ! <+++++> Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
Why not? I need to get in there! <+++++> I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
WALKED RIGHT INTO IT. <+++++> NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR WINGMAN. NICE GOING.
Why not? <+++++> Because I know what it says.
I... suddenly felt such a fool. <+++++> I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
So what if he was? It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all. <+++++> Maybe.
I know, no--  I know. <+++++> I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--

Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure. <+++++> Ray.
Anyone at home? <+++++> I live there. Alone.
Dorothy Vallens? <+++++> Yes.

What'd this guy look like anyways? <+++++> Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore. <+++++> Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder? <+++++> Because everything that man's done has been suspicious.
With the paper to prove it. <+++++> I'm going to have a home. Not just a house I'm afraid to stay in... and a man to go with it.
He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work. <+++++> It doesn't matter...
What is it really? <+++++> A glorified office block.

I knew you'd come. <+++++> You knew?
No, you weren't <+++++> Then why'd you ask?
No, thank you. <+++++> How about Marvin's sixty-fifth birthday party?
Hildy, darling! <+++++> Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit. And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...' <+++++> Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit! witches!
Speaking of the Vacant Post. <+++++> Dottore Fanelli...
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you. <+++++> True enough.
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body. <+++++> That thing's dead. What the hell are we waiting for?
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions. <+++++> I know what you mean.
You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds. <+++++> Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face.
We can't. <+++++> I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the airport and get on a plane.
Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival. <+++++> I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either.
The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know? <+++++> Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
You're back. <+++++> Yeah.
Charlie, this is business. <+++++> 'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
About what? <+++++> The FAA announcement.
I've been humming it. <+++++> I heard.
Stop it. <+++++> Okay, "mom."
It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong. <+++++> They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
You take her to the station house. Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left. <+++++> Hey. I'm a professional.
Right. Yes. Of course. <+++++> It's very bad this. Terrible sad. Such a young man.
Higher. <+++++> Right, right. Good.
It's my job to keep my job. And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard. Good ole Tribuus has been retired. <+++++> Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
There's a lot you don't know about me. <+++++> You're right.
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick. <+++++> No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thingÂs been done. <+++++> ..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
... That's what you told us to say. <+++++> Give me that phone. Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?
That's all right. I'll attend to this. <+++++> Wait a minute--let's match for it.
Impressive. <+++++> Wanna hear something more impressive? My first twenty fights were stumblebums handpicked by my manager.
I don't think you'll grow careless. <+++++> Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
I'm sending you the files. <+++++> Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
That's not going to happen! <+++++> But it could happen.
Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired. <+++++> I'M WHAT? !
I'm a Tom? I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think? <+++++> That's exactly what I think. I want you to create something that people want to see.

Where did you go to school? <+++++> I was at Beadles.
You cut that up fer lunch, Luke. <+++++> Yes, Boss.

What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called? <+++++> Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
Federal Express for 'Zavitz'. <+++++> Federal Express?
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here-- <+++++> Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
How long do I have? <+++++> Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed.
Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you? <+++++> I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years.
Uhhh... I have no idea what you just said. <+++++> SPEAK ENGLISH! JESUS CHRIST WE'RE ON TELEVISION HERE!
So now you'll have a mother. <+++++> I don't like her.
Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out? <+++++> Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
Should protect you a little, from the compression. If that thing gets ahold of you. <+++++> Thank you.
You'd recognize it if you tasted it. <+++++> I doubt it, darling.
Friends and <u>colleagues</u>. <+++++> You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble. Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...
Thanks, Joe. <+++++> Shee-it, you know, I got this thing all figured out, Ratso. I mean Rico.
Why? <+++++> 
You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and -- <+++++> Quiet!
We can't leave now. We have to do something. <+++++> Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said.
Hiya, Norm. How ya doin', Margie? How's the fricassee? <+++++> Pretty darn good, ya want some?
We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that! <+++++> You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
Sit down, Gino! <+++++> No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
Asking about you. I must say you have friends in influential places. <+++++> I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt? <+++++> NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
Sonny was hot for my deal, right? You know it's the smart thing to do, too. I want you to talk Sonny into it. <+++++> Sonny will come after you with everything he's got.
What? <+++++> You're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother.
Look great, don't I? <+++++> Got a job for me?
You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back. <+++++> Someone should be with you.
I said I was sorry. <+++++> Don't be sorry. Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras? <+++++> Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you? <+++++> I called her up.
No. <+++++> Oh.
Joanne? <+++++> You know her?
...maybe... <+++++> ...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough... <+++++> It's probably just a strained muscle.
Yeah... She's okay, though. <+++++> I guess.
No gas. <+++++> This car runs on gas.
How are you holding up? <+++++> I'm swell.
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball! <+++++> What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!! !
Tell me what you know, I'll tell you what I know -- <+++++> No Can Do.
My father's guilty. He lied to me, he lied to everybody. I just left home... I need you. <+++++> You do?
I have always been here... <+++++> Are there any other humans?
All right! What do you want? <+++++> We want ... a shrubbery!
Uh-huh. <+++++> Well, you know what that would do to me.
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'. <+++++> Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
Unka unka unka unka unka. <+++++> Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way.
What about me? <+++++> Oh, your case was preordained.
What did you think? <+++++> I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already  -- <+++++> And stop interrupting. his is the big scene. Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge, baby! And you lost.
Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous. <+++++> And then...
Announcing what? <+++++> There are seven deadly sins. Gluttony, wrath, greed...
Why do my eyes hurt? <+++++> You've never used them before.
My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose. <+++++> What was that all about?
What happens if they don't do that? <+++++> I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine? Ninety-six thousand dollars. John? For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets... <+++++> Murray said...
I wish I could have been a normal man like you. I wish I could have a simple life. <+++++> What the fuck is going on here? !
Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything. <+++++> You're a great kid. Don't you forget it.
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly. <+++++> I have a schedule...
No English. She has terrible pain in her belly. <+++++> Pregnant.
 <+++++> Almost right.
Who's that? <+++++> Curtis.
That's what we were working on. <+++++> Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn. <+++++> You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
You--a friend to me? <+++++> Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house? <+++++> That's the plan.
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood. <+++++> I want him!
I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you. <+++++> Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
Figured what out? <+++++> Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
I can't believe your grandparents never come down here. <+++++> You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs.
All right, I'm on fire! Black Seven, seven stickin' spades. Let's go! <+++++> I'm your man...  You win again. Well played, sir. You are on fire.
How did it go with your father last night? <+++++> Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight... I mean... he misses you, Mom...
Bullshit. <+++++> I mean it.
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business. <+++++> You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep. <+++++> Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
What's this: "I'm declining this case?" It don't work that way. <+++++> This can't be my last duty here. It will go on and on.
You want to go talk? <+++++> Not really.
I'm sorry, Kelly. I'm sorry it had to happen like this. She was losing it... <+++++> There was no way. That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...
A few years older, perhaps. <+++++> How's your arm?
I am. <+++++> WHAT?
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord... <+++++> George...
What kind? <+++++> Nash.
Why's it so goddamn hot out here? <+++++> ...Fred...
At 29.83 at 9. I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards. <+++++> I just want her to be happy.
What's up? <+++++> I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...
It's not family. It's business. <+++++> So talk to me tomorrow. After the gig.
Jody he was lying. <+++++> What if he was? Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
I mean, why do you do it? What purpose does it serve? <+++++> It has no purpose. It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
Endorse me and you will be free. Think of it. What would you do with your freedom? <+++++> If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you.
Did you got through my pants? <+++++> I might have a solution.
I did. Boy. <+++++> Three kids. What's she going to do?
Yeah. <+++++> Me too.
And it had diamonds in the back. <+++++> Yes.
How so? <+++++> By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city.
About twenty minutes. <+++++> Is he on his own?
Yes. Nick! <+++++> You his wife?
Believe it. <+++++> They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
Nice piece of work. <+++++> Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time.
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond. <+++++> You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
All in all, quite a canoe... <+++++> Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
Anything's better than Mark. <+++++> My shrink says he's not so bad.
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy? Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens. <+++++> I don't know, George...
Everything green on my boards, Skipper. <+++++> Start the countdown.
Take it easy now. Don't rush it. <+++++> How long... how long I been out?
Out of the way, John! <+++++> No! Don't kill him!
Do it. If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it. Have enough guts to do it. <+++++> Don't talk to me about courage. I know death, what it's like to kill.
But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo. <+++++> What class sub does your nephew run?
What do you mean? You've never been there. <+++++> I've been there every day for the last four years.
Hi, Mark. <+++++> Hi, Stacy. How are you?
Hello. <+++++> Hi.
Rowan... Think of what's in that book. Think of last night! <+++++> I am! And so are you. You thought you'd found yourself a nice, sensible doctor. pause)  Michael, if you don't want -

How long 'till we can eject? <+++++> We're going to have to reconfigure.
What? <+++++> Don't you hear it?
I know. I taped it. <+++++> It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
What now, sir? <+++++> We put out the word. We'll start along the south side of the Santee...
I'm not going in Doug. I'll wait for you here. <+++++> Okay, whatever. Come on Chris!
I'll leave you to your business. <+++++> Excuse me... I should apologize. I, um... I... have no great love of...
We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two. <+++++> I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it.
I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday? <+++++> Of course, the only problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract more.
Sure...it's not that...I mean... <+++++> It's all right.
Better ask Paul D. <+++++> Can't locate him.
You were there? At the play - last night? <+++++> A happy coincidence.
Listen, forget the shoes. I'll just take a cab... Uh... <+++++> Parry.
He's not what I expected, Sir. <+++++> What did you expect, Lieutenant?
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list. <+++++> I committed no war crimes.
You know? <+++++> Yes.
Why? <+++++> To bring you... your birthright.
And because he's my friend. <+++++> Friends don't help other friends cheat.
Sorry. Got held up. What are you doing here? <+++++> Delivering gossip and goodwill. It seems we'll both be doing Brighton. Perhaps you should come too.
Nick, listen. From Clyde Wynant! "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay". <+++++> Let's see. Where's it from?
Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are. <+++++> Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you. <+++++> You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?
He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you. <+++++> Who wouldn't.
First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day - <+++++> Twenty-four.
Did you /hear/ that, Oliver. <+++++> Yes, Betty. But the false promise of a new dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset.
Don't say that. <+++++> Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day.
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court. <+++++> When?
Why did she do it? <+++++> You... she said I didn't love her.
Peoples China Bank. <+++++> Where the money is.
CTU? Jesus. You don't think -- <+++++> Don't know. Ask around. I'll be back.
You've got no jurisdiction. <+++++> You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
No, I haven't heard. <+++++> There was a second.
When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head? <+++++> On my life, I promise you I will.
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week. Is there a problem at home? <+++++> Certainly not!
...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." <+++++> I...see. I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
What? <+++++> Yes, it's true.
And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax. <+++++> I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations. <+++++> Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.
Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva? <+++++> You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off. <+++++> How long does it take a man to land?
Katarina Stratford. My, my. You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again. <+++++> Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Piggyback ride. <+++++> I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.
Llewelyn. <+++++> Yeah.
We surprised a band of smugglers. <+++++> Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
Where? <+++++> Down there. That little one there.
Just take it easy, this isn't my fault. <+++++> Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing!
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry. What do you think? <+++++> What I think is ... they're cowards. Their opposition represents the cowardice of the Eastern Establishment.
I've never seen him before. <+++++> He must have known Charles pretty well.
I figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet? <+++++> No way, man, you'd rob me blind!
Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive. <+++++> Oh...
1500 meters. We're getting too close... <+++++> Where is it?
Hm-mm. Oh, yeah. I met Phil. <+++++> Mmm?
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her. <+++++> Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it? <+++++> Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . .
It was my fault we lost the Power Source. <+++++> Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? But she stiffed me. A real skunk. <+++++> A real skunk.
What? <+++++> I think it's about that time, Letty.
No, no! I'll stay and help you find your friend. <+++++> I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
Shall we close up, then? <+++++> Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
I'll call you right back. <+++++> Right back.
They're true! Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason! <+++++> Charlie!
Let me get that for you. <+++++> Oh please. I can't have you do that.
But you don't realize.... <+++++> Goodbye, Aud...
Screenwriter? <+++++> Eh - Ian Fleming?
What am I? The fall guy? <+++++> I hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner. Nice food, isn't it?
Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent! <+++++> Lafayette is a child!
Where is it? <+++++> Upper West Side.
Does it hurt? <+++++> Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down! <+++++> No woman would!
No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture. <+++++> Great idea, Maxie! Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us. Build them a dormitory in the woods.
Very generous of you all. How much? <+++++> 10,000 gold crowns.
Oh my God...! <+++++> What happened?
Will he wish to know the details of this night? <+++++> He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
You are weird. Let's just go. <+++++> Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here.
Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant. <+++++> Oh, I'm much more than that.
What's the idea? <+++++> No, no, no. Now that's too much!
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory. <+++++> He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
Yeah. <+++++> I hear you're a good thief.
A thousand times good night! Exit, above <+++++> A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
Somebody told her. <+++++> Who?
TERMINATED!? Shit! Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now! <+++++> Negative. She is not a mission priority.
Say what you want and you'll see -- <+++++> Wanna kiss me, Jim?
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things! <+++++> Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide. <+++++> Do you have any particular reason to say that?
How are you feeling today? <+++++> I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
Can we get to him? <+++++> No, I had to seal off a whole section. We'd lose too much of our remaining air if we opened the connecting door.
Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white. <+++++> Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office.
--otherwise we may have to-- <+++++> Otherwise you may have to what?
Years? There are going to be lots of... opportunities. <+++++> Gale... you're a very nice person. I wouldn't want to hurt you... in any way...
People still need values, beliefs.... <+++++> No, they don't. Not the smart ones. Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status....
Soon. <+++++> I have to ask- why do you need me?
Yes. <+++++> For what he made me go through.
With anything? <+++++> Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?
Pretty rough so far. <+++++> The swearing, Paul. There, I said it.
Hey, I don't believe it. <+++++> Hiya, kid.
My God, Rose, how can you be so selfish? <+++++> It's so unfair.
Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway? <+++++> What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out. <+++++> I knew this was going to happen.
They're liars and cowards. <+++++> I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
No, no, no, no. <+++++> On the contrary -- this is tremendous.
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky? <+++++> Who?
I moved payroll onto the computer. It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night. <+++++> Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
See? Nothing. <+++++> Nothing at all?
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he? <+++++> Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one. <+++++> What'd you feel when you kissed him?
What'd you do, take the scenic route? <+++++> Sshhh. No time for that. Come on.
I think you have the wrong number. <+++++> I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
Like what? <+++++> Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'. <+++++> Arlo, nobody's gonna believe us.
Do you know who her doctors were? <+++++> I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
You're welcome. <+++++> I'm going to bed now.
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have. <+++++> You realize, of course, that thousands of swords have been collected. How do you expect me to find yours?
Yeah. <+++++> I thought I was going to die.
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything. <+++++> I don't believe you.
Should I call you later? <+++++> I'll just see you when you get back here.
What kind of truck? <+++++> I don't know. Big. Dark.
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from? <+++++> My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.
Yes. <+++++> She's not in the gaming business is she?
I don't "want" it, if you catch my drift. <+++++> I'm giving you three leads. You...
How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma? <+++++> I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
They come here. They all come here. How do they find me? <+++++> Mr. Bialystock ...
Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later. <+++++> Well, there's something missing in there. There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
You're really into God, right? <+++++> In ten words or less?
Don't worry about it. <+++++> We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?
I vouched for him and he'll come through. I promise. I'll talk to him and straighten him out. Don't worry, OK? <+++++> OK.
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are. If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead. <+++++> What do you know?
He's just exhausted. <+++++> That man is your father?! ?
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else? <+++++> Mr. Leland sent back that check.
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up! <+++++> But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
Nope. Somebody's thinking about this one. <+++++> Amazing there's someone within two hundred miles actually dumb enough to still do that.
They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it? <+++++> Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.
It's what I deserve. <+++++> Whad'ya talkin  about ?
Split? I wouldn't get ten... <+++++> ...miles.
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us. <+++++> Yeah.
Oh, I've got to get some matches. My cigarette. <+++++> I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
Jim was old enough... <+++++> He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
Animal! When the war's over, remember I told you I'd fix you up with Betty Grable! <+++++> Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
Yeah, one of my favorites. <+++++> You made the front page.
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before? <+++++> Sure, in the war. Pull those cables--
I don't know what we're talking about. <+++++> We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged. <+++++> Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif... <+++++> The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway. She couldn't have lived with it. I know that now.
Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear. <+++++> Damn. Let's go.
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring. <+++++> Oh, you've noticed it, too?
But he was singularly the most brilliant student I ever had in a classroom. He created programs so beautiful, so lyrical, they were almost like symphonies... <+++++> Can you tell us what's on the disc?
Blade. We've got six Reapers. They're all dead. <+++++> Fry 'em.
Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface! <+++++> That inspires confidence, that does.
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table. <+++++> Hey--I went to Northwestern! Once. To use the bathroom.
Yeah. Ricky Slade. <+++++> You see a Ricky Slade?
In my pocket. <+++++> We got him! Dad you got him!
I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon. <+++++> That's okay. Live a little, learn a little.
Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive. <+++++> Are they hitting you up for donations? Asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee?
I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night. I have a confession to make? <+++++> You're married.
It's a mess. <+++++> So?
Oh, my gosh. <+++++> Now we'll both call him.
Hey -- you let him... <+++++> You like sad stories -- you want mine.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EACH OTHER <+++++> SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR THEIR LOVERS
That's a strange combination. <+++++> So were my parents.
Useless distractions. <+++++> It's like the Stone Age. The room time forgot. What about a phone?
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam. <+++++> Rose.
Why? <+++++> I feel sorry for him.
Stifler, you're such an asshole. <+++++> Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway? You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you?
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room. <+++++> Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
Jim! <+++++> Who's that!
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh? <+++++> Uh-huh.
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did. <+++++> "...did." Well, okay.
Who's a busy man? Me? I'm Chairman of the Board. I got nothing but time ...  What do you want to know? <+++++> Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop-- <+++++> When Jeff gets through with Taylor--  Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!
Yeah, you still got it, Betty. Who's Mr. Jocularity? <+++++> That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
Where did you go last night? What did you do? <+++++> I don't... I... I can't remember...
He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here. <+++++> What did he want?
No. It goes way back. Or so my Momma says. <+++++> What else does she say?
Well, it's enough for me. <+++++> You don't have to say that.
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out. <+++++> Only one young boy ever drowned in that lake, and that was before you were even born. His name was Jason Voorhees.
What? <+++++> Look.
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke. <+++++> I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
Please don't shout. <+++++> I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
I don't understand. <+++++> Something came up in autopsy tonight. Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
No! You take another step, I'll shoot! They're trying to kill me... <+++++> You're wrong. You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.
Where does she live? <+++++> A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with. <+++++> I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis. He wrote it.
Two of them are still missing! <+++++> There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up. Are they all shark victims?
It's me. <+++++> Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes. <+++++> What mistakes? Look, I think it's no big deal but if you want to find out why this ship sank have Maritime run a check.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead? <+++++> With some milk jugs I just happened to pick up on the way home.
I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much. <+++++> What are you gonna do? Fight with him? He wants his money.
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on- <+++++> What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
I'm getting a strange meta-physical buzz. Shit. I'm, uh, dead, aren't I? <+++++> Sort of...
How long does this go on? <+++++> I don't know. I'm sorry, Kay...
And he sent you to me? <+++++> He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
...I prefer apartments... Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends? <+++++> Friends? You're crazy!
I don't know, I don't know, I just know it. <+++++> Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts --
Yes sir. <+++++> I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures.
Like Custer huh? <+++++> These guys think the West is just MTV and Hollywood movies. We've got to show them there's more to it.
We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump. What are you giving up? <+++++> I don't know. My friends...
No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take. <+++++> How many times do I have to hit her? I hit her enough.
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...? <+++++> Mother?
Not that I can see. <+++++> Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts.
Of course you do. Who was it? <+++++> I hate him for what he did to me.
Tomorrow night. Can you come? <+++++> I don't know. It wouldn't be very smart.
So you're saying she moved out. <+++++> This morning.
To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center. Maybe you know him. Richard Long. <+++++> We're worried...
Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville. <+++++> Granville?
What did you do after that? <+++++> I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there.
Water? <+++++> Waves...  A beach. A woman whispering. That's all. I need to stay awake. Do you have any pills?
Should we take a walk? Or maybe some food sent up, or something... <+++++> I just want to be alone. Is that okay?
Can you think of a better one? <+++++> Not me. I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.
Sonny, your wife's on the way ... We reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got. <+++++> Well, what were you doin' back there?
So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear. <+++++> Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
He got away. I had him. He got away. <+++++> Do you think he singled you out?
Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job. <+++++> You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone.
Sleep well? <+++++> Yeah, you?
More or less. <+++++> Not this twig, friend. I got plans.
Yes, I did. We were city champs. <+++++> Objection. Irrelevant and immaterial.
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate. <+++++> How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft. <+++++> I could teach you a thing or two now.
At the field office. <+++++> Let's take a look at it. Drop off my stuff at the hotel after you're done here.
To calm your anxiety. <+++++> To calm my anxiety.
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could -- <+++++> Um --
Where is the film crew from the British Museum? <+++++> They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
You could've made me lose my call. <+++++> So what? What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told. <+++++> You heard?
Repoed this morning. <+++++> I'll provide you with transportation.
Dlagon not like that. Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness. <+++++> Then you'll understand my quest. An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.
Romeo <+++++> I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
Would you bribe me to leave you be? <+++++> I would make you rich.
I can't believe his mother let him come over here. <+++++> Right. Well, she didn't, exactly...
I think it's gonna be a waste of time. <+++++> The police used him as a witness in this case.
Yes. I just got busy. <+++++> That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
Did it occur to you that Graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy? <+++++> What do you mean? I don't understand.
It's nothing to be ashamed of -- <+++++> Wait a minute!
It'll be ready in a minute. <+++++> Never mind that.
Anybody you think is evil? <+++++> Yes.
That's great, guy, thanks a bunch. When do you think you'll need me for real work? <+++++> Well, it's kinda a strange time right now. Things are kinda -
I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense. <+++++> Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
You really think I should forget her? <+++++> You have another choice.
I feel fine. <+++++> Not nervous? Relaxed?
How about if I buy your car for ten grand? <+++++> You serious?
How much do you usually get paid? <+++++> Uh -- I don't know. Sometimes it's just like a barter thing...  Is this legal?
He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ... <+++++> It's best not to ... It's good pizza, huh?
Something like that. You? <+++++> I lost a bet.
The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it. <+++++> And you've never seen anything like that?
And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned. <+++++> You knew it was me all along?
You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets? <+++++> He was on his way to Venice, right?
What about you? <+++++> A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures. The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
No. Absolutely not. <+++++> All right. All right. We'll see.
I'm sorry Mom canned you. <+++++> It's really... not anything, Lainey. It's just --
There's Dave. He knew too. <+++++> Stop it, Jimmy.
Right on. <+++++> G-d, I'm stoned. I'm stoned. I'm really...
How do you -- the two of you -- get by? <+++++> Materially or spiritually?
Is that an insult? Are you insulting me. <+++++> Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Eve! My understudy... <+++++> Didn't you know?
Is there any chance? <+++++> I guess there's always a chance.
It's not that long. <+++++> Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white! Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota.
 <+++++> Excuse me...
You told him you liked him. <+++++> That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight. And the tide rushes in. <+++++> You really love me, don't you?
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times' <+++++> You got it.
Nothing further, your Honor... <+++++> Mr. Concannon...?
What they call you? <+++++> Red, and I ain't no punk.
No. You lost your way. <+++++> Well, you're probably right. I guess that's all that hubris is.
You just move in here? <+++++> About two years ago.
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it. <+++++> Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
Ah - - they're here. <+++++> Who?
What do you mean? <+++++> I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now... I'm not kidding.
Now you just turn this way and go right straight down. <+++++> That way, huh?
Not far from it... <+++++> Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
And above all, not hurting the object of your love. <+++++> So that's what love is?
Fred Astaire and whatÂs her face! <+++++> ItÂs not me. I swear. ItÂs her. SheÂs magic.
Paris - <+++++> Leave me alone! He's going to kill me! !
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny. <+++++> What do you have to buy?
So what? <+++++> So shut up and keep painting..
I understand. <+++++> I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
Bail jumper's name is Cookie Kincaid. Nineteen years old. His mommie posted bail when he was arrested for allegedly partaking in a drive-by shooting in Hawthorne. <+++++> <i>He killed two children.</i>
It's not the icebergs. But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this. <+++++> You're flattering me.
Every young man should at least once...Go on, Laurie! Read! <+++++> A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW!
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody? <+++++> Because it ain't natural, young man.
You're being ridiculous. <+++++> Industrial espionage is not ridiculous. Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
It is not! <+++++> It is too! Now you passed it!
Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me. <+++++> Insolent -- Berlin manners.
I want to talk to General Ripper. <+++++> But we can't communicate with the base.
No? <+++++> Should we close down any eruption?
HEY. <+++++> You're marking us, Bill.
Why don't his parents ever take him to Vegas with them? <+++++> You gotta ask <u>that</u>?
All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick. <+++++> What else could I do?
looks startled at the outburst. <+++++> I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence? <+++++> Oh yes.
I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative. <+++++> But I'm not prepared to die.
 <+++++> 
Impossible. <+++++> ...what a world.
What about that? <+++++> How you doing in there, hero?
Don't ever let go. <+++++> I won't.
Come on, get with the facts. <+++++> Hmmmmmmmmm?
You put filth in my child's mouth. <+++++> Aw.
Where do you live? <+++++> Orange, New Jersey.
You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive. <+++++> No, I'm gonna drive.
Well, there's several ways to go . <+++++> Come in, have a drink, we'll talk.
You'd look naked without one. <+++++> Oh, yes! Where's mine? I want to look like you.
Hannah and I are in the last stages. <+++++> Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close. She'd tell me such a thing.
Is that what you would've done? <+++++> You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word? <+++++> Ten years, I think. What I miss?
You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon. <+++++> Gotcha.
Is that what this is about? Material wealth? <+++++> What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home.
I'm gonna throw up, Frank. I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay? <+++++> Susie. It's one more show. One more time. That's all.
You think I'm all talk, Eddie? <+++++> It doesn't matter what I think.
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today. <+++++> Why not?
And you are...? <+++++> I'm Princess Bala.
Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag? <+++++> No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets.
Yes, I'm very hungry. <+++++> 
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean. <+++++> No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines. <+++++> A major!
Ottawa! <+++++> Excuse me...
You're not going to play it again. <+++++> Well, lemme play the other side then.
Hello? <+++++> Hello, mom?
Hey... <+++++> Shut up.
It's got nothin' to do with bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't you? <+++++> Sure I do, Earl.
Oh yeah. They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they? <+++++> They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
What's that noise? <+++++> What?
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God! <+++++> Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not "Taxi Driver." Now listen up cause this next part is crucial.
 <+++++> Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital. I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
No, it's Ok...you came in early. Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything. <+++++> Well...
Yes, Mama. <+++++> I don't want you drinking, Frances.
I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people. <+++++> I don't want folks to be searched, it makes people uncomfortable. If I can't be safe among my own kind, where can I be?
I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they? <+++++> Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything.
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING? <+++++> I don't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time.
Not unless you can fly. <+++++> Come again?
Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you. But they don't want to see me... <+++++> That's not true.
So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before... <+++++> How can I do what I do now? Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please. <+++++> That's amazing.
The Judgment is ours! <+++++> Naturally. But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
You was my brother. You should of looked out for me. Instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money. <+++++> I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
What now? ! <+++++> Wait a minute ...
No, we ain't got no Heineken. We got Miller. <+++++> Genuine Draft?
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that. <+++++> You're not much with girls, are you?
Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married. <+++++> I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way.
It does? <+++++> Did as of last week.
Increases? <+++++> Well yes, what did you think this was all about? Fun and games?
The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now... <+++++> ... How long?
We can't do without you. You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology. You're practically an institution around here. <+++++> That, apparently, is the problem. I'm yesterday's news. Who needs a Curator of Plant Biology in a museum with one exhibit on plants?
Waddaya getting so sore about? <+++++> I looked all over for you last night, you know that?
Unfair? ! <+++++> Yes. Unfair to me.
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye. <+++++> You're going? Well, thanks again. Good to see you, Rachel... Thanks for coming, Mel. I'll get your car back.
Women's room, stall two. Should we stop for ice-cream? <+++++> Yeah!
Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. <+++++> We don't have much of a relationship anymore. I haven't seen her since before she married Rex.
You want to join our gang? <+++++> I don't mind.
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera... <+++++> ...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please. <+++++> 'Love was... '
What can I do about it? <+++++> You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
Off the scale. <+++++> What do we do?
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it. <+++++> Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone. <+++++> No. I just need some space, maybe.
Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur? <+++++> That's fine. But what are we going to do about grandma and Uncle Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two nieces --
Mrs. Straub! <+++++> I've killed my husband!
I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes. Do you think that's why we're meeting. To help us say goodbye to Rafe? <+++++> 
What museum? <+++++> I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me. Help me, Steve.
What?...WHAT! ? <+++++> I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...
Yes, I believe that's right. <+++++> But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away. <+++++> Okay.
He's inherited a fortune. <+++++> You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
Like what? <+++++> Like...
Where are we going ? <+++++> The Brooklyn Bridge.
Isn't "bait" the word you used? <+++++> Hey look, somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat!
C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not? <+++++> D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter. <+++++> Then you don't stand a chance, Mr. Chief Justice, you have a lost cause.
No! I swear I don't know! Please! <+++++> Do you think I'm a fool? That the Commander does not know every bolt, every weld of his ship?
What do you look for? <+++++> We ask questions and measure the answers.
Yes. <+++++> Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world. <+++++> You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her. <+++++> It's definitely your mama.
It's the best collection I've ever seen. <+++++> Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
Why should I come hollering to you at all? <+++++> Because... because... Listen Edie, don't get sore nowÂ but I think we're getting in love with each other.
Make it twenty. <+++++> Twenty-thousand? I don't have that kind of money. I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead.
Man, Day-Day is my people! <+++++> I said shut up! Now who sent you?
You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game. <+++++> Stop acting like you're someone special. You're just like the rest of us.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox? <+++++> Aye --
I have to get to Sugai. <+++++> Goodbye, officer.
I am sorry, Mr. McManus. f implore you to believe me, Mr. Keaton. Mr. Soze is very real and very                             + determined. <+++++> We'll see.
I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard. <+++++> Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one. Sorry.
Then... I guess you have to. <+++++> There's another thing I've been thinking about.
But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right? <+++++> 
Spain. <+++++> Madrid or Barcelona?
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple. <+++++> Really? You've never been inside?
You called the cops on us? <+++++> Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
I mean, you shoulda heard her there. Tellin' her whole story...I believed her. <+++++> How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.
When did you get in? <+++++> Yesterday. Afternoon.
It's upstairs. <+++++> Have you ever been there?
One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding? <+++++> Energy shielding positive function.
Someone should give you a raise. <+++++> Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
Are we allowed to start hating "Wendy" yet..."Gee Wichita, I guess mosquitoes have always liked me." <+++++> You and Wichita go to school together, right? Have you two ever...
Fuck, this happened before. It's this shitty ear. Born with it. The batteries wore out in my aid. I'm sorry. <+++++> It's all right, sir.
So call her up. Tell her don't talk to any Cubans. <+++++> Her phone's probably tapped.
I... but I... <+++++> You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
You know what gets me? <+++++> Let's talk about it some other time.
Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying. <+++++> I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement. <+++++> Are you, General?
I like him, Mom. <+++++> You do?
Had any schooling? <+++++> Yeah, a little.
How do you want us? <+++++> Up there.
Tor! <+++++> Tor. Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it. Stay strong and he can't do shit. <+++++> Man, I wanna smoke a joint.
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation. <+++++> I didn't use Low's name.
 <+++++> Jim, I appreciate what you're saying. I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.
End a story. <+++++> What'd this guy look like anyways?
But why my name, Richard? <+++++> Because you're getting on that plane.
I wanna get out of here. That's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what I'm saying? <+++++> You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
Huh? <+++++> 'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
But we can't kill it. If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space. <+++++> Shit...
And what of the Enterprise? <+++++> I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain.
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred? They're worth five times that. <+++++> Sixty.
-- No! I can't go along with this horseshit! Just tell them they can fry me! <+++++> What? !
Talia, don't go! <+++++> Wha-at? What is it?
I assume Benes knows how to control it. <+++++> That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.
Hello, Ed. <+++++> Ann. Will you come in?
This is why you don't show work in progress. <+++++> Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
You mean, you know who this baby belongs to? <+++++> She belongs to all of us. She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.
Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy. And you see, Godfather... He...my daughter...they... <+++++> You want him to stay in this country.
Read it. <+++++> 'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
Magnificent valor... <+++++> Shoot them! Shoot them!
If Chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that? <+++++> I don't care. I love you, Chris. You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you? <+++++> The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it? <+++++> Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
No difference. <+++++> Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.
You're sure this is gonna work? <+++++> Yes!
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another. <+++++> You figure!
Where? <+++++> Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. <+++++> I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I? <+++++> Let's drop it.
Oh, Peter. <+++++> It's me. Put the gun down. Maya...
I am too old to climb down a rope. <+++++> You won't have to.
You really do believe in destiny? <+++++> Only if I want something bad enough.
I think on account of his nose. <+++++> You're going to have to explain that one.
Shit... <+++++> I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
 <+++++> Yeah.
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me? <+++++> What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
Jim. <+++++> Yes, Spock?
You in? <+++++> Yeh, I think so. I gave the kay- ducer a C-note. You find out the deck?
Rowan Mayfair. Who's calling...? <+++++> I wish to speak to Ellie Mayfair.
Tell me about him. <+++++> No.
This is real, Bananahead! <+++++> So?
His apartment? <+++++> I mean -- her apartment.
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear. <+++++> Cliff--
Of course. Mister McMurphy. <+++++> After you, ma'am.
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed... <+++++> ...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science. <+++++> A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
So you're in? <+++++> Are you kidding? I always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion.
I didn't do that! <+++++> You said you were here all day?
It's just a corpse. <+++++> I know that.
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough. <+++++> Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
It means it's too cold to go swimming. And I don't mean the water. <+++++> I wasn't going to try anything.
I remember him. Got in a car crash or somethin'. <+++++> We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar. I was drivin'.
We ain't married no more. <+++++> He says that to all his wives.
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else. <+++++> Carrie.
Mac? Oh there you are. What are you doing, honey? No more work. Don't you feel breezy. <+++++> I'm in mourning.
A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh? <+++++> It might have.
If there is anything else, don't hesitate -- <+++++> I won't.
Yes. It is unfortunate. <+++++> Well, there's nothing we can do about it. Why get excited?
Talk to me. <+++++> INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY.
Daniel... <+++++> What? No kiss? Not even for old times sake?
That's why you're here. To get in the middle of something? <+++++> Maybe. I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened. I've never...
Yes. My best friend. <+++++> What's he like?
Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula... <+++++> Fuck that shit.
Sigmund Freud? <+++++> 
What the hell are you doing? <+++++> What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat. <+++++> It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say? <+++++> It says 'Dear Terrance, please don't ever tell my son that I licked your hairy balls.'
Nothing yet. <+++++> I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
Ever read any Poe? <+++++> I don't think so, but I love her album.
Oh really? That's great. <+++++> I said we are totally booked.
No, no, sh, sh, sh - - stop! Stop! Stop! Don't let the monsters come over here! <+++++> They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals. And these are herbivores.
Oh yes they do. Look. One is like a tall princess. <+++++> A princess?
I think that's it. <+++++> There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
When I married Myles, we were both maladjusted misfits. We still are. And we've loved every minute of it. <+++++> That's fine, Stella. Now would you make me a sandwich?
Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house... <+++++> And you think it's in there?
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos... <+++++> Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
I believe we've exceeded his expectations. <+++++> I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.
Remembers what? <+++++> The blood transfusion.
Big zippo so far. How about you? <+++++> Patience hotshot. Patience. It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
If you want to go on, I can make it all right. <+++++> Like I said, I was thinkin' of the horses.
And who is she? <+++++> Just a girl.
Can I help you? <+++++> I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?
Specifically, Humpback Whales. <+++++> That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
Right. So why is he dying? He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him? <+++++> Time.
Why should I? <+++++> Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.
Huh? <+++++> He's trying to form words.
Oh no ... I'm fine. <+++++> How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
Yeah! <+++++> How much ya wanna bet?
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room. <+++++> I'm concerned about her health.
What do they want? <+++++> They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please? <+++++> Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
Three oÂclock. <+++++> ÂLe MercuryÂ. Newman street. Ask for Peter.
Spit it out. <+++++> MY girlfriend's pregnant.
Yes, aha. A brass screw. <+++++> Is this leading somewhere?
Maybe he's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that. <+++++> Maybe... why do you ask?
What do you mean, demons? <+++++> He told me he was going to Hell.
No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog. <+++++> Jennifer gave her a make-over.
Is anyone there? <+++++> Look.
Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else. <+++++> Or else what?
A long time. <+++++> Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
 <+++++> Happily married, probably.
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her. Makes me nervous. <+++++> She's a big girl.
You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot. <+++++> I'm staying.
I'm okay ... I'm okay ... <+++++> You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you. Come on ...  ... let's get him out ...
Extraordinary, isn't it? <+++++> It's impossible.
Well, I'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear. <+++++> Really? !
So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it? <+++++> Very simple, Earl.
Ohhh yes. No, no. Just a little, you know...We're fine. <+++++> Well, I'm glad. Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
Baby names? <+++++> I don't know. Nightmare.
My license expired, let's get out of here. <+++++> Sure...
There's only you, Ryan. You know what, Ryan? You're beautiful. I love you so much... You need... <+++++> I don't need a drug.
 <+++++> Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
No, <u>my</u> name. <+++++> I do not know your name.
Do it on your own time, Paddy. <+++++> What?
With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends. <+++++> I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial,
Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be? <+++++> C'mon --
No, I suppose not. <+++++> He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
Stop it! <+++++> It's you, Norman. Your fear of drowning. You have to face it.
They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me! <+++++> They just want you to hire some new help.
Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous? <+++++> No.
I think it's time I came home now. <+++++> That's not a decision for you to make on your own.
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to. <+++++> You can't give up.
What are you going to do? <+++++> I'm going to California.
Guess who just signed up for a tutor? <+++++> You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
Jordan. Might we do this over lunch tomorrow? I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely -- <+++++> Did you set me up? Did you set me up just to see me fail?
Do you like putting makeup on people? <+++++> Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet.
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again? <+++++> Says who?
Why haven't you called? Why don't you answer your phone? <+++++> I don't know. I'm sorry...
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night? <+++++> Yes sir.
What are you talking about? <+++++> You'll figure it out and you'll do good by him.
Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song. <+++++> Uh-huh.
Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all. <+++++> Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
Like you, I'm good at it. But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning. <+++++> You need a vacation.
Her name is Jill. <+++++> What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
When the Queen commands it. <+++++> But at the playhouse. Nurse?
How'd it go? I don't know. Daniel, how would you say it went? <+++++> I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
A Russian exam! <+++++> I cannot believe this. It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison. I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
Oh--a God complex <+++++> Stay away from the cop.
But you're planning to be? <+++++> I don't know. Possibly.
I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has. That I'm happy today. <+++++> What have you been before today?
You're society girls? <+++++> Oh, yes. Quite. You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
Are you kidding? <+++++> No, I distinctly remember: <u>you</u> walked out <u>my</u> door. Ergo...
How's your eye? <+++++> The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings. How's your neck?
It's okay, it's okay.... <+++++> Sean! Listen! Listen to me, Sean.
He's cracked up. <+++++> He is not cracking up.
Well, I'm not on drugs. But I might be crazy. <+++++> I don't think I wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.
Oh, no. <+++++> Who is it?
Hello? <+++++> Hello. Is Claudia here?
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right? <+++++> By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
You stole it? <+++++> I borrowed it.
I donÂt know. HeÂs gone! HeÂs gone. I donÂt fucking know where, I swear... HeÂs gone. On holiday... <+++++> ...On holiday?
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money! <+++++> Drop that fucking money!
You can crash at Stifler's? <+++++> It's all good. Breath check.
Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers? <+++++> Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
Fifteen lousy bucks. <+++++> A man who plans ahead.
Uh-huh. <+++++> I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
I'd like you to have them. <+++++> There's really no need. This is just a scrapbook. I should feel obliged. Thank you.
I loathe bats. <+++++> So did I, once. But I kept coming back, and... I guess I became the thing I feared most.
That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record -- <+++++> Don't be shitty.
Needing. <+++++> To belong to someone.
It's the truth, I swear. <+++++> All right, forget it. Tony, you got anything we can put on his face?
You worry about me really? <+++++> Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.
Where? <+++++> In downtown Sydney for a start.
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed. You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car. <+++++> We split the money?
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony? <+++++> Yes.
A very convenient guy -- this superintendent. Have you checked his bank deposits lately? <+++++> Jeff -- huh?
Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out. <+++++> That's right.
Oh. <+++++> Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.
What the hell are you doing here? <+++++> I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim.
She's a pro. <+++++> What?
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse. <+++++> What happened to it?
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun. <+++++> Maybe we are...
No - funerals. <+++++> Would you mind rejoining the living? Goose it up a little.
Were you born in Havana? <+++++> Angola. My mother was being a surgeon there. She volunteered.
That's a pretty big sin. <+++++> I know.
But I thought you'd hired a private investigator. <+++++> A private investigator?
Bastard!! ! <+++++> This is all a mistake. Jack, please take that mask off.
She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right. You're going to have a fantastic time. <+++++> Stop saying fantastic. Where are you going?
What okay? <+++++> What!
Don't tell anybody. <+++++> Why not? If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ! The record's
Bam Bam. <+++++> What'd they call her in college?
Oh, well... It came from the heart. <+++++> Well then keep it coming. Alright, people, good work! Keep it up and we'll do great at the state competition.
There. <+++++> Check it out.
Claude Banks. How could I forget that? You've got to remember me. Ray Gibson. We went to high school together. <+++++> You went to Monroe?
Oh. Bigfoot gets his out of a can. <+++++> How do you know?
Should we be doing this, dude? <+++++> Metaphysical question, man.
You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody. <+++++> Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us.
Who's this? <+++++> It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
He lost it on the way up. <+++++> What kind of a shark did you say it was?
Only at the very end. <+++++> How do you feel after a shooting.
I don't need a plant. <+++++> Everyone needs a plant. This ivy is one tough baby. It's a cutting from one of mine.
Get back from the shore. We know how fast he can leap out. <+++++> We shouldn't even really be doing this.
No. Most of them are in transit by now. I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security. <+++++> Okay, then. I leave it in your able hands.
You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering -- <+++++> I wouldn't know anything about that.
Fuckin, Zookerman -- <+++++> THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN! THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN!
Did you know I was an alcoholic? <+++++> What?
What's the matter... <+++++> Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child. <+++++> Exactly! What is it Johana? You're so crazy about him, you don't see the truth? !
Maybe we should do some exercise. <+++++> This is all the exercise I need...
What's happened? <+++++> It's serious. That's all I can				* say. Just meet on K Street under				* the Key Bridge. At eight sharp. *
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers -- <+++++> Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
Yeah, but they never made a movie here. <+++++> I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
Sorry. <+++++> Eh, there's only three of them.
If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this. It's all your fault. <+++++> ...And I thought you loved me.
Yessir. <+++++> Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
You hungry? <+++++> No.
I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan. <+++++> Who are you?
Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs. <+++++> Yes, sir.
Gin, really. <+++++> Tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow. Or forget the Mask.
Don't worry, we've got everything. <+++++> Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
And? <+++++> Can I get some help over here?
She showed me a drawing. <+++++> You	fool! That symbol is us -- us. She was asking about us.
You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think -- <+++++> Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be.
Will you take a check, Bert? <+++++> Cash.
I can't do it. I'll get hit. <+++++> Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong! <+++++> We have to get off this beam!
Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am? <+++++> Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.
Lauren? <+++++> Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?
How long has it been since you've seen John? <+++++> Nine years.
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy. And jumping in... <+++++> You didn't jump in.
And would this storage facility be located on these premises? <+++++> Yes, it would.
That's right, fellas. Catch any cab heading uptown. All the drivers know Ray's Boom-Boom Room. <+++++> Hey, Ray...
 <+++++> Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
What is it? <+++++> It didn't get washed down. It's figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of.
Who? <+++++> A nigger.
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you. <+++++> I know. I know.
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman? <+++++> I know her. I knew her.
And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him. <+++++> What do you do when he comes home?
Max. <+++++> McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast. Carter's here, though.
Calm, Dishonorable, Vile Submission! Thou art my souls hate! Tybalt! You ratcatcher, will you walk? <+++++> What wouldst thou have with me?
Then who the fuck are you? <+++++> Your fear. Do you remember the Goliath, Miller?
I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission. <+++++> With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship.
You like it? Take a look. <+++++> Don't rush me.
No, it was a complete waste of time. <+++++> This is so embarrassing, it's never happened before. Well, maybe a couple of times, but I was alone.
What? What do you remember about that -- dumper? <+++++> Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know.
It's been a while. <+++++> I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
Or you could try lying down. <+++++> You're in quite a mood today.
I mean, I've done what I came to do. It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass... <+++++> Right. You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
Then what do you need me for? <+++++> She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."
I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement. <+++++> Don't even think about it. 007. They're my granddaughters.
What about your wife? <+++++> What about her? Let's c ut up the money, I want to get North.
The hell you didn't! <+++++> The hell I did!
Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out? <+++++> I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
Thanks for coming back for me. <+++++> I love you.
Cuervo...? <+++++> You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
Would you care to go topside? <+++++> Very much.
Yeah? <+++++> Drafted by the Red Sox.
Isn't it like, obvious? <+++++> Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
Right! <+++++> We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
Like you, I find it difficult. <+++++> But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished? You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
I CAN'T PUT A COMPUTER IN A MOVIE SHOT IN 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm gonna' do that? <+++++> Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
Saddle up, Roughnecks ! <+++++> You heard the Lieutenant ! On the bounce, troopers !
Yes. I know. <+++++> Good.
Zane Grey. <+++++> Oh, that is Mr. Martins' little joke, of course...
What's his name? <+++++> Brill.
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me? <+++++> Of course.
Yeah, yeah, I know. I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him. <+++++> You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out. <+++++> Oh?
That was a pair bond! A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound! <+++++> I want to see the nesting ground!
What do you think? <+++++> Gripping. It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
Sloan, I got it like 'dat. <+++++> Oh you do, huh?
Why did you phrase it like that? <+++++> Like what?
I don't know, I think... <+++++> Look, would you argue with your doctor?
A night in the hole? <+++++> Better make it a week.
That's all, Miss Bennett. <+++++> It isn't all! I'd like to explainÂ
If I believe you, it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night. <+++++> And if you didn't believe me?
I actually know this one. <+++++> You do?
But honey ... <+++++> Or why don't you just put a sign outside? "No dogs or women allowed!"
Y'all never use it? <+++++> Never... But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though.
I don't want to go. <+++++> Go where?
Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves. <+++++> I like him. He can stay.
Yes, sir. But so do we. <+++++> But we mean it because we are a peace- loving country. Are they a peace-loving country, Major.
Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job? <+++++> I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
That's too bad. <+++++> I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
Do you have another tie? Something more conservative? <+++++> Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me. It's at home.
Yes... <+++++> Do you think if you saved Catherine, you could make them stop...?
Can't locate him. <+++++> He's sleeping in the church.
I guess I'll head back... <+++++> Stick around... Larry, one of my "gang" -- Bud Fox.
Give her to me. Catch up with us quickly. <+++++> What do I do?
Yes, Mister Harding? <+++++> Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem.
You do remember that, don't you? <+++++> Bulishit! You're fucking with my head!
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself? <+++++> If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
Ask the priest, miss. <+++++> That's enough. Go join the others, and don't come back here. And you'll have to control your temper.
What facts are those? <+++++> I understand how it could happen. I know why any guy would love her. And I can't blame you that it happened.
Excuse me, Counselor Wendy, I need assistance in finding that important...thingie in the storage room. <+++++> Oh my gosh, why didn't you say something earlier...
You mean it has hyperdrive? <+++++> Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
Why did we not know about this sooner? <+++++> Sir?
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive. <+++++> Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
We went to Code Blue... <+++++> `Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months -- that's his only reward. Let him take a few teeth... <+++++> A few teeth... that's the price of his life?
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it. <+++++> Finish what?
Now you're going to do just what I tell you to. No discussion. No hesitation. <+++++> Yes sir.
That-a-boy. Hospital. <+++++> I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
You won't have to. <+++++> Well... you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper...
He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car. <+++++> You can't fix this car, Spicoli.
She left me. <+++++> Why?
Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it? ! <+++++> I have no idea what you're talking about.
Unsolved mystery. She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something. <+++++> That's a shame.
What? ! <+++++> B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block... But you, I mean, I know how...
-- we can't now. <+++++> -- why not?
I should've danced with you. <+++++> Okay. Good-bye.
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial? <+++++> I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.
Of sorts. <+++++> I do hope she enjoys a good show.
We are awesome monster-bashers! <+++++> The meanest!
Fucking crow. <+++++> Sign of the dead come back to life.
Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please? <+++++> Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
A vulgar pop term, but yes. Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin. That was our goal. <+++++> Ask what you can do for your country. That kind of thing.
Thank you for calling the white House... <+++++> No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything. I definitely didn't expect this. <+++++> I know. My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again. <+++++> That's right ...
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that? <+++++> Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
I don't carry it with me. <+++++> You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do? <+++++> He's a plumber.
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places. <+++++> You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena.
I see you've been out visiting the folks. <+++++> It's Hunt. What do you need for a pinpoint? Been watching a little T.V., have you?
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without... <+++++> ...twenty years in order to find nothin' on me -
He lost all the weight... there. <+++++> That's impossible. A guy can't --
Federal Express? Hm? By the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard. <+++++> Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
...time to time, yeah. <+++++> Not tonight...
Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal? <+++++> These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season. <+++++> Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
No. <+++++> It's there.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!? ! <+++++> I said -
Who the hell's that? That's not what's his name...the grad student? <+++++> Nah, it's September. Must be the new one.
Yeah. Take it. <+++++> Thank you very much, sir.
What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim? <+++++> Not likely. There must be tracks of twenty different wagons. Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...
Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him. <+++++> That comedian?
Just easy on the words you're putting in my face, Sergeant .. <+++++> Whass going on here?
Christ almighty. <+++++> ... and then he, uh... took the other one.
And you told your nephew about it? <+++++> I figured he had a right to know.
There's that weird dude again. <+++++> Man if this place doesn't cool out I'm gonna hang out somewhere else...
Ready for what? What are you supposed to be doing? <+++++> I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
One chip? <+++++> The most important one. Can you help me find him?
You needn't be so frank with me about your work. <+++++> Why not. I trust you.
Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe! <+++++> May I have your ticket, please?
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick! <+++++> Yes, you are. You're very sick.
Big family... small? <+++++> One brother, one sister.
Incredible. Unbelievable! For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now? 'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>? <+++++> We couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but...
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of. <+++++> Aaarrrgggaahh.
We get Adler and we beat this thing. <+++++> How much do I pay him?
A spring trap! <+++++> 
We got jobs, man; we're working. Why even take the chance? <+++++> Because if you don't take the chance, you're already dead.
Pouring myself into my work. <+++++> I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
I thought I'd find you here. <+++++> I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!' George paused. You really think I should swear? <+++++> Yes, definitely, god dammit George, swear.
It turned out Phil Green, Mr Integrity, had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the Tangiers... <+++++> Why are you doing this to me?
And? <+++++> No sign of them yet; but they're still on the Estate.
Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you -- <+++++> Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists? <+++++> My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
My wife's going to have a baby. <+++++> How about that.
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing? <+++++> I got pretty close.
Good shooting, Rafe! <+++++> Land of the free...
Baseball batsÂ that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar. <+++++> And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
I'm looking at you. <+++++> I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation... <+++++> You and your pep talks.
As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her. <+++++> Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally. My friends... I can't ask you to go any further.
Every day. <+++++> Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
Why are you asking me all this? <+++++> Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
What the fuck's that got to do with it? <+++++> They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns.
I saw Desert Sun, I wanna tell you... <+++++> No, I was, I was, I was just <u>learning</u> on, it's a...
Thank you, sir. Your kindness is greatly appreciated, but if it's at all possible, Artoo and I would like to remain in your service. <+++++> I'd consider it an honor.
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here. <+++++> I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry. <+++++> Keep trying.
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer. <+++++> Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
I'm your son. And Laureen's son. <+++++> Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead.
I think it is. <+++++> I thought so. Come on, I'm in a hurry.
I told you this was gonna happen. <+++++> Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
Who gives a shit, Walter? What about that poor woman? What do we tell-- <+++++> C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back--
He is the only one unaccounted for. <+++++> Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
He was the best I ever trained, you know. <+++++> Ricky Tan?
Please-- <+++++> He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
She didn't know anything about...I wouldn't have wanted her to. <+++++> Lucky girl.
I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back. <+++++> You are the younger of two...
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey? <+++++> No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals...
My pleasure .. Who's Popeye? <+++++> Your predecessor. He did- n't like to get outta bed. Catch you later, Freddy T ..
Hi, Laurie, what's up? <+++++> Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
Can I call you at the office? <+++++> What do you want to call me at the office for?
Not on my own beat, no. <+++++> No? Well, where were you when that happened?
My secret? <+++++> Yeah. Ten months we've been fishin' this river together. We use the same equipment, more or less...
Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now. <+++++> Oh.
Toast? No...just the butter. <+++++> Right away.
I was worried about you, Suzie. I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up. <+++++> Are you mad at me?
I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes. <+++++> How?
How? How were we the same people? <+++++> Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.
You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong? <+++++> 
Were you attracted to me right away? <+++++> No.
What department store did they go to? <+++++> McIntire's.
You want some <u>advice</u>. <+++++> Yes.
I'm going to open it! <+++++> No you're not!
Is that a promise, then? <+++++> Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good. <+++++> Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you. So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh.
And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in. <+++++> I don't like cake.
Sorry, no. I just got one. <+++++> Excuse me, sir. I have an actual fact for you.
 <+++++> 
 <+++++> You always said I was a bum. WellÂ  Ânot anymore. I'm going down to the dock.
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it? <+++++> Awfully.
. . . . . Maybe you think the same thing about me. That's why you keep avoiding me. <+++++> I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . I like you . . . I really do.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that. <+++++> That's because most of it never happened.
So you made a generous contribution. <+++++> What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
Yeah? <+++++> You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you? !
It was eight. Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game. <+++++> Eight.
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?' <+++++> Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
Rosato, where's your brother? <+++++> Sitting right behind you.
I like them french-fried potaters. <+++++> Yeah, me too.
Serving with you has been an honor. <+++++> The honor was mine. Captain Riker.
I mean if you knew it were stolen. <+++++> Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
They'll recognize it's not your husband. <+++++> Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
I'll come to the wedding. <+++++> I'm telling you you can't.
Let's go. <+++++> No sauntering down the aisle. Just make time. Let's just get there.
No, I'm not, but -- <+++++> What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
Don't say anything. <+++++> Where are we going?
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win. <+++++> Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business. <+++++> You didn't take it.
And they got Penny! Look! <+++++> Don't shoot!
on staircase; from Gaston's point of view. He stops. <+++++> Yes, M'sieu Laval?
How? <+++++> Use the gifts that Allah has given you.
End my career? <+++++> How are you going to fight this?
Door to the right. Get up and run. <+++++> I can't see a thing.
You're worried about your college applications. <+++++> I'm not applying to college.
But if she's cloaked... <+++++> Then all we've got is a neutron radiation surge - and by the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes...
Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie - always a subtle joy. <+++++> Thanks, David. Always a pleasure.
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings. <+++++> That's what I thought. If you don't mind, I'm rather interested in the Treasurer's report. I'd like to hear it.
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers! <+++++> That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!
It was the lovely Samuel Johnson who also spoke of a fella "Who was not only dull but a cause of dullness in others." <+++++> "The" cause of dullness in others --
Noooo... <+++++> Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
I beg your pardon? <+++++> This is 1952....?
I don't mean Fernando. <+++++> Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails."
But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper. <+++++> That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard. <+++++> I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up. <+++++> He hasn't.
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet. <+++++> 
Um...who's that? <+++++> Don't know. Did you check everywhere? Maybe it was hidden in something. Maybe there was someone else--
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid. <+++++> What?
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better. <+++++> When you do, let me in on it.
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense. <+++++> What doesn't?
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money... <+++++> Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
Actually. They'll want Annabelle's mother. <+++++> Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it -- <+++++> Mom!
You'll be all right? <+++++> Yes.
Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand? <+++++> Yes, Ma.
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me? <+++++> I've got a theory.
William, you're not making sense. <+++++> [Beat] They're at Church. And I bet that's where Becker is.
I think you'd better stop the car and let me out. <+++++> Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend.
I can promise you nothing. Nothing but a moment. Maybe two. But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime? <+++++> Yes.
Oh, okay. can I call? <+++++> Okay. yeah, call.
 <+++++> I see.
That's okay. You alright down here by yourself? <+++++> Oh, sure. Don't worry about it.
Yeah, right... <+++++> "Yeah, right"... well why not? What's so wrong with me?
I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things. <+++++> Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here. <+++++> One-twenty.
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and - <+++++> Come on. I know better than that -
So -- you've laid the ghost. <+++++> I believe I have.
Well. What kinda job is it? <+++++> Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
Who? <+++++> I don't know.
Let's see the money. <+++++> First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
And Mom says anger never, never <u>solves</u> anything. It makes every- thing <u>worse</u>. <+++++> That's because your mother is a fine person, finer than I will ever be. Now, just this once...
Pull out. <+++++> I'm ignoring you.
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest. <+++++> Whatever.
May I offer you a drink? <+++++> Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...! <+++++> Shove it up your ass you faggot!
You want to get married...? <+++++> You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
Well, we could borrow a couple from Mrs. Simpson. You know, she went to Niagara Falls last year. <+++++> I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though.
No! They're still on their way. <+++++> That doesn't make any sense.
Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble. <+++++> Better keep a lookout.
Do you know that for sure? <+++++> It's mine.
"Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase." They print any kind of shit in these papers. <+++++> They certainly do. Two fifty-five.
Is that what you call it? "<i>Real</i>"? <+++++> At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
Prescription. For my condition. <+++++> What condition?
Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons-- <+++++> We don't have time.
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed. <+++++> I've done nothing and for that I am ashamed.
So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet? <+++++> Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.

Do it? <+++++> You know...take the pictures?
Oh. But, if you please -- what are Munchkins? <+++++> The little people who live in this land -- it's Munchkinland, and you are their national heroine, my dear.
Vivian, life's not a fairy tale. <+++++> I know. Hey, don't mind me. I'm being stupid. I'll think about it, okay?
Get out of my way. <+++++> Not once have I ever asked anything for myself. I ask now. Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.
 <+++++> He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse. <+++++> No sir, I don't, but I know Plank Road. 'Bout a mile up thataway.
Your existence will cease within moments. No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come. <+++++> If I could get my hands on you...
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again. You don't know what it means to know that you want me. <+++++> Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
Oh. <+++++> Are you going to deny it?
A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film. <+++++> It was hot!
What are you doing? <+++++> I know you're not calling Jimmy.

I contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back. <+++++> That's news to me. So it's over at Jesse's office?
Ain't no sense in it, neither. I figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night. <+++++> How?
HOW MUCH? ! <+++++> My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
Take the boss loading, kid. For God's sake. I don't want to hurt you. <+++++> Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .

Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick! <+++++> You want to know what I think?
What about bowling? <+++++> Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
What is it, Betty? <+++++> Look at that. Get a gander.
Yes. <+++++> Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
Yes. <+++++> Was looking at FurtwÃ¤ngler like that?
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression. <+++++> People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.
Not very well. <+++++> 
Hi. <+++++> Hi.
Is he still working here ? <+++++> The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that.
We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes... <+++++> Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act. <+++++> You think so?
Where'd you get that horse? <+++++> Beauty, ain't he?
C'mon, just do it. <+++++> C'mon Lloyd.
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student. He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip. <+++++> It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
Stop calling me Max. <+++++> Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it. <+++++> ...Then go.
We can't let him run around. He knows too much. <+++++> Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly. <+++++> What's stopping you?
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . . <+++++> Hold on bollocks, no one but card players in here tonight sonny, and I do mean no one.
I like him. I think he's a sweet guy. <+++++> Yeah.
Can you believe the songs they been playin'? <+++++> No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family.
Answer yes or no. <+++++> I... No.
But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew. <+++++> I don't
 <+++++> Oh, great. I'll talk to you later, bye.
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend -- <+++++> You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by.
Yeah, right. That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara -- <+++++> Puppy love. This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.
And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped. <+++++> This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere. Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
Are you staying at the hotel? <+++++> Not at all.
'Cause I didn't ask him. <+++++> Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am! <+++++> Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
...-to a simple thing like... <+++++> ...fishin'.
Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes? <+++++> Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know? <+++++> Of course.
I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse. <+++++> And you're worried about him.
CÂmon, Evelyn ThompsonÂs got no class. She doesnÂt marry Dr. Steve, the womanÂs living in a trailer. <+++++> Hey, is that really necessary?
That was for Christmas. <+++++> I was missing you.
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow. <+++++> I think so too.
I said something. <+++++> I know you did!
Two? <+++++> Who said there were four?
Everything... I don't have children. <+++++> Agnes...
Thanks, Jerry. Tell me something. <+++++> What.
So I says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.' <+++++> Ya got that right.
You are too gracious. These things have some merit, I suspect ... but this--  ... I am convinced, is fine. <+++++> Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time? <+++++> No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- God, it was hot. The wood on the sundeck, everything.
Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business. <+++++> Don't make it less true.
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that. No way. I've never killed a man. Never even shot at one. <+++++> Well neither have I, but it's us or him.
Where are you? <+++++> I'm in my bedroom.
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket. <+++++> Oh! Go away.
...they did it for a lark. <+++++> Oh, Good. The ornithological leitmotif...
Show me. <+++++> Show you?
We're slowing down. This must be it. <+++++> End of the line.
How's the pain? <+++++> How's yours?
You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive. <+++++> So you're going into the Army?
Well, I owe you one, don't I? <+++++> You most certainly do.
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison. <+++++> So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
I don't know. <+++++> Are we gonna split up?
Well taken, Concorde! <+++++> Thank you, sir, most kind ...
And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard. <+++++> Do you believe that?
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova... <+++++> Let's forget that we ever met.
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him. <+++++> That must have been pretty special.
Rodgers... this is no good... <+++++> Cut the crap, you've been taking the man's money for years. Now it's time you earned it.
Unless what? <+++++> Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday.
Michael? <+++++> No. No. No. I don't believe it.
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera? <+++++> Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
How'd you do that?! You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state... <+++++> Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination.
And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book. <+++++> Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that. Would he?
Go back to bed. <+++++> Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word.
Your beneficence. <+++++> I'm serious. Whatever it was - it's still there inside me, isn't it - change and all...?
We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart. <+++++> I'm trembling with excitement.
I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void. <+++++> That's so romantic.
Was it <u>every</u> day or just semi- weekly you got your ass kicked as a kid? <+++++> <u>Now</u> you can bring the vehicle to a stop: there on the left.
What is it you want? <+++++> Before I ask you to be honest with me, perhaps I should be completely honest with you--
 <+++++> Now wait a minute. There are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding.
You're all part of Satan's army now! <+++++> What the hell is going on? !
You have many friends ... and admirers ... <+++++> Do you ever pray? You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away? <+++++> Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
That was my card, pop! My card! You hit for my card! <+++++> I... sorry, Mister...
We had an argument. He's being silly. <+++++> I swear, I don't know this girl.
They're still looking for him. <+++++> Who's got the contract?
You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts... <+++++> What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
Did you get it? <+++++> I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
 <+++++> And give a deposition to the jUdge.
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid. <+++++> I bet. Going into people's homes.
Who is it? <+++++> It's me, Ed.
Don't wanna miss this. <+++++> Lookit. Lookit!
Peculiar? You mean, like back then? <+++++> Yes, something was...
I don't know. <+++++> George!
You must be rich. <+++++> It keeps ya busy.
Who? <+++++> The other guests?
What time is it? <+++++> Almost two a.m.
This? <+++++> That's good thinking, Baxter.
You don't know anything! Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back! <+++++> And then what? Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
If he comes here, I'll handle him. Remember -- I've always protected you. Haven't I? Do you need money? <+++++> No. I just wanted you to --
Three people. In Brainerd. <+++++> Oh, geez.
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do. <+++++> I'm glad I killed them... I'm glad...
You're very perceptive. <+++++> Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening.
They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for? <+++++> Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
You're wrong. Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore. <+++++> Holes? I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh. Sorry. <+++++> Don't be. I'm not. It's good money. 'Side, he's worth it.
Suit me? <+++++> Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
Too easy? <+++++> He's gotta know why.
Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar? <+++++> I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it. <+++++> No, no. I don't want to be idle.
I'm not a field agent, all right? So cut me a break. <+++++> An F.B.I. Man asking me for a break. How droll.
It was only an accident that we discovered them. <+++++> I know, but...
It's twenty after one. <+++++> I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
How about in the forum. Right in front of the Senate. <+++++> If I may be so bold...
Stifler's mom got it in the divorce. <+++++> It reminds me of this one time --  Hey, can I ask you a question? How come you don't have any stories?
You were father's secretary -Â I never thought - - <+++++> Didn't you? But now -- what are you thinking now?
It's Tommy! They got Tommy! <+++++> Oh my God!
But that's what happened before. <+++++> Not this time.
What? ! <+++++> Don't lie to me!
No, sire... I was asleep. <+++++> I wanted to kiss her, but she didn't want to kiss me... She slipped away, the moment I wanted to take her in my arms.
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter. <+++++> Otis, were you up to your old tricks?
Don't worry. I'll talk to him. <+++++> Don't.
And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful. <+++++> Look, I think I'm going to have to go to the john again. You go on through, I'll catch up.
Me? Sing? <+++++> Yes -- quickly, dear!
You sure this is...medically advisable? <+++++> Got a doctor on duty.
When? <+++++> Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
I don't know. <+++++> When's your show?
I'll never get my washing done. <+++++> That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook. <+++++> He's in it with Willis?
You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring! Let me buy you a drink. <+++++> Least you can do.
Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'? <+++++> Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that.
He's not! <+++++> He is!
Who knows. <+++++> Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer.
The Republicans? <+++++> No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.
Mr. Robinson? <+++++> Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
Yes. <+++++> I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
The numbers simply don't mean anything <+++++> Oh yes they do. Look. One is like a tall princess.
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it. <+++++> So he could have decided to go on a trip...
I'll see you later. All right? <+++++> You'll come by?
Diseases. <+++++> Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
I have five-hundred dollars. <+++++> Can you show me? Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!
Do you think she'll be all right? <+++++> She knows how to take care of herself.
You hurt, Daddy! ? <+++++> No, no, I'm all right, son... This damn leg just won't act right no more!
Yes...<i>yes</i>... <+++++> You're angry--
Holy shit. <+++++> He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
Thank you. <+++++> Now Rex.
God protect me. <+++++> Not from me, surely...
Yes? <+++++> You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he? <+++++> He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school.
That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma. <+++++> Land sakes, I don't mind. I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture.
Dad says you're late again, you butthole! <+++++> Leave me alone.
Is it real love? <+++++> Well --
Ya know, I was. <+++++> Really?
Blow where? <+++++> You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say. <+++++> That's right.
I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old. <+++++> What happened when you were twelve?
He's gone. <+++++> Uh-huh.
You look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it! <+++++> Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing startedÂ
Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds... <+++++> Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company... <+++++> A Carpet Cleaning Company?
Mmm-hmm. <+++++> But there were more of you?
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike. <+++++> We were supposed to play golf.
Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone? <+++++> I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course.
I hear you... Partner. And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em. <+++++> I'm ahead of you...partner.
 <+++++> Please...
Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick. <+++++> It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
Sit down, woman, sit down. You like me, don't you? <+++++> 
Oh. Eh, I like it. <+++++> No, you have to touch it. You have to run your hands over it, get close to it, really reach out and feel.
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone? <+++++> I don't think so. Of course I was terribly upset... I hardly knew what I was doing.
Promise. <+++++> Promises mean nothing.
How do you know what I experience? <+++++> I know you!
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk. <+++++> Who, Grady? Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us? <+++++> I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'
I know... <+++++> We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all
 <+++++> Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
Turn! <+++++> Stop it ... damn you!
Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells. <+++++> How many?
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet. <+++++> Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with.
You like it? <+++++> I always did.
Well, you know, that happens, on the street. <+++++> What is that supposed to mean...?
Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant. <+++++> Put me on the hailing frequency.
What's your opinion? <+++++> It's hard to say for certain, these things are--
Peter Webber! Right. Quite the spotlight on that guy. <+++++> I did tell you, didn't I? That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
Oh, it's stupid, isn't it. <+++++> Is that your driver?
There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it? <+++++> Eh --
Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ? <+++++> No. I see them.
You can't? <+++++> I looked everywhere. I even went to his house. It's locked up.
Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is. <+++++> Why she got a chain on her?
I told you i'll get in trouble. <+++++> Pacifist!
I have excellent long-term memory. <+++++> Yes.
Where does the river lead? <+++++> It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey? <+++++> Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment. Oh no.
Whatever you say, darling. <+++++> I heard about your stunt. That's swell, King. Just think of itÂthe groom lands on the lawn with a plane.
Now you get up! And you get in my house! <+++++> Or what?
I must go where I can be of use. <+++++> But -- there's so much more to do right here. And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
This is crazy. This is the left- field thing of all time. What do I do? What do I tell my family? <+++++> Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill. You'll ruin the good start we had last night.
Don't work too hard. Oh, before I forget. I talked your neighbor out of pressing charges. <+++++> What?
Cal, stop! It was an accident. <+++++> An accident? !
From my father. He was the tribe's Shaman. <+++++> A medicine man?
 <+++++> We can use all the support we can get. I think these might interest you.
Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you. <+++++> The point I'm trying to make is that this is a blessing.
The Head Man's writing a Bill. <+++++> A Bill! Not *him*!
Exactly. And he got good. <+++++> No kidding.
I knew. <+++++> You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
Many have perished in that maze. <+++++> No maze to me, my fried. It is where we take refuge when they hunt us.
Oh, that's too bad. Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too? <+++++> I don't see why not. Why don't you come along with us? We're on our way to see the Wizard now.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it. <+++++> Go home now.
No, he's working on another book. <+++++> Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques? <+++++> No. Jacques is a creature of the sea. He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done. <+++++> Do you, indeed. I'll bet you do. Fine. Fine. We'll save the court the time.
Beg pardon? <+++++> Doc. You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills? <+++++> Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
October 31st! Halloween! Don't you get it? Orson Welles! <+++++> You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
What? <+++++> Or the vitamins? Or the...?
We ended in F Major? <+++++> Yes.
Give me the bat. <+++++> Jack, stay away from me!
Yes. Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you? <+++++> This is my second commercial flight. I used to run satellite freighters but that got old fast.
What the hell is that? <+++++> My gift to you.
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting. <+++++> Come with me. And stay in the room.
Henry's got our orders! We're going home! <+++++> When?
No. She's dead! <+++++> I'm sorry to hear about that, sir. His face contorted in rage.
What's this? <+++++> My non-denial denial.
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares. <+++++> So I've been told. Practically an obsession of your.
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money? <+++++> Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl? <+++++> Nothing.
What happened?!! ! <+++++> Ahm.... .
Whatta you got, telescopic vision? <+++++> Still don't see it--
Did you sleep well? <+++++> Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no. <+++++> She shot you down.
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward. <+++++> Come on, children!
I didn't ask any question. <+++++> I believe you did.
Why do I always have to answer the phone? <+++++> Because you're the closest.
Watch out! ! <+++++> Keep firing!
Sure I can't twist your arm? <+++++> Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
South Dakota - north? <+++++> South Dakota - but on the top.
I'm not going back there. I don't even know who you're talking about. <+++++> Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
I was in the basement fixing the pipes. Would you believe that? <+++++> What pipes?
Will you go with me? <+++++> Where are we going?
I don't want to hurt you, Sam. <+++++> I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time? <+++++> One. Here, in front of my ear.
Real McCoy. <+++++> You're a preacher?
I will. <+++++> You will what?
What does that mean? <+++++> Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together... <+++++> Our minds?
Respect your elders and your betters! <+++++> And no elbows on the table!
What's up, sugar? <+++++> Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory? <+++++> It was neither a valid concept nor a valid fact. Suspect Zero came to represent every killer Dick Low had not caught.
 <+++++> Yeah, they told me.
Take a few days -- <+++++> I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
Thank you. <+++++> I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
Help! <+++++> If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea. <+++++> If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out.
Actually, yeah-- <+++++> Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky. <+++++> I'd better go report this...
Why she got a chain on her? <+++++> That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes. <+++++> What?
What the hell... <+++++> Anacott Steel. Buy it.
No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on. <+++++> Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please. M'mrnm.
Two more. <+++++> Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
Holy stinkers, what were you thinking? <+++++> We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
You think that's the place she's buried? <+++++> If they actually bothered to bury her.
No. It's not right. <+++++> Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.
Not yet. What do you know about it? <+++++> I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
What's she doing in California? <+++++> It's for that piece she's doing on women and competition. She's off to the Women's Western Golf Classic.
That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course. <+++++> Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
Oh, yeah? <+++++> Mm-mm.
Mind if I look around? <+++++> Help yourself. Oh, Tom, show this gentleman...
I have the power to build a time machine. <+++++> How is that possible?
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet. <+++++> That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
Valentin? <+++++> Good. There. Yes?
I do not! <+++++> Try and control this ...
I thought he was with you. <+++++> No.
I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior. <+++++> Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays.
Good night. <+++++> Good night.
See? And what does this guy she's with do? <+++++> He drives a carriage.
Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing. <+++++> The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what I mean? <+++++> Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
Maybe I was hiding. For years, I never told Ben the one important thing. <+++++> He knew.
Oh, it's nothing. <+++++> No really, I love knowing what people read.
It's gonna be different living over here. Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit. Understand? <+++++> Hey, Pops, I'm grown. Can't nobody get me in trouble no more.
You felt sad. What's your name? <+++++> Jessica.
Yeah, that's right. <+++++> Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either.
When'd you get here? <+++++> Just a few minutes ago.
She should go home. <+++++> I'd take her, but then who would stay here?
When did it all start? <+++++> You mean my problem?
The last I looked, we were just talking things over. <+++++> But the setup's there. It's there now.
So you're sure she's dead. <+++++> Pretty sure.
Anybody hungry? <+++++> What'd you get?
Morning, Coogan. <+++++> How's it goin', Coog?
But you... you're different. <+++++> I am?
Oh! <+++++> Now do you believe me!
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty? <+++++> Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at. <+++++> What variables?
No. <+++++> What are you doing?
Right. <+++++> And be right back.
Alice... <+++++> Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
Is this 509-9027? <+++++> Yeah. You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
Yes. <+++++> Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births.

When do we talk? <+++++> After dinner.
Mitchell knew then. <+++++> Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens?
So he popped the pane? <+++++> Bingo.
I'm afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my friend. What was in your mind? <+++++> I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline. Let her know --
This is General Ripper speaking. <+++++> Yes, sir.
Frank. Come in. <+++++> Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally? <+++++> For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
Like tonight. <+++++> For sure?
The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- ! <+++++> Your Honor, I know as much about these gangs as anyone; I'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked...
And if you ditch us we get zilch. <+++++> Sure, I end up with some cash. And a lot of bonds I don't know how to dispose of.
Don't worry about Jaeger. He uses his personality as a form of birth control. <+++++> Blow me. Have I said that to you guys recently? Blow me.
I'm no threat without a gun. <+++++> No, you're not.
It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you? <+++++> I'm glad you do.
Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it. <+++++> I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.
Come to Daddy. <+++++> This isn't happening.
Oh, you see an analyst? <+++++> Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Your older brother. <+++++> You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin. <+++++> I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
Why, honey -- <+++++> Come on.
So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow. <+++++> And...?
Doc. Nice to meet you. <+++++> Sorry I'm late... traffic was a motherfucker. Have another drink, I'll be back in five.
Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second. <+++++> Sure.
This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen. <+++++> I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.
You're being really immature. <+++++> What?
Maybe I can turn it into a bit. I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged. Demand a recount... <+++++> Andy! You don't get it! They don't want you back.
What was I supposed to do with him? I can't take him away anywhere. And nobody wants to take him for me. Do you? <+++++> He no!
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models. <+++++> All of us are typing and clicking, George. Whether we want to, or not.
I'll bet you can. <+++++> You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you, Doc? If I was caught, wouldn't you?
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that! <+++++> Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
Where are you from most recently? <+++++> California. San Francisco.
I quit the movie. <+++++> Why did you quit?
If I told you once...I told you a thousand times... <+++++> I know...I know...if the cash is there we don't care...  Finnegan this is as mean a pile of shit as we ever carried...
In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her? <+++++> No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
Now, remember -- keep it simple. <+++++> Don't worry.
When you threw it in, what did you see? <+++++> ...I saw nothing.
Come on, Jack -- don't. <+++++> Pretend I'm somebody else.
You shit. Who do you think you are? <+++++> I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
I just gave him my card. <+++++> He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
Twombley involved? <+++++> No.
Catch a movie? Miniature Golf? <+++++> I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
Oh? Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here. <+++++> Are you a deist? Is that it? A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you. <+++++> That's perfectly clear.
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex. <+++++> You sneaked a peek at the Rolodex. Nice.
But he's never said a word- <+++++> You know Alfred. He'd never say Anything. But I can tell. Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me. <+++++> But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
You tell me. <+++++> I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
She's my mother. <+++++> What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
Then what happened? <+++++> I realized he wasn't serious. He was seeing other women -- asking other nurses at the hospital out, so I ended it.
If you'd only seen her, Miss Connell. She looked so pretty. <+++++> She must have been beautiful. What happened to her, Alma?
I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up. <+++++> Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me. Listen, you fuckin' cunt.
Mr. Soze will be most - <+++++> Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle. <+++++> Ripley? You mean the wall street guy?
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you. <+++++> I never thought he'd do it.
We're not coming out. We're not letting you in. Get out of my house. <+++++> Say fuck.
How do you know? <+++++> Voice stress analyzer.
You should have known better than to write, Romeo. I found that out a long time ago. <+++++> I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run? <+++++> We never had a problem with that before.
You said they was only going to talk to him. <+++++> That was the idea.
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us? <+++++> Fuck you.
Violet Bick! <+++++> I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind.
You remember your dreams, Grady? <+++++> Only the wet ones.
You made this, and the drawings? <+++++> Yes, but listen. The illusion is easily explained. The eye retains each image, till they combine.
I don't know what to say except I'm sorry. I just don't have rabbits on my mind. <+++++> I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family! All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"
Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back. <+++++> Don't even start.
I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety. <+++++> I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time. But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you. <+++++> What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman. <+++++> You're not going, are you?
Well Â the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you. You ask Edward to go with you. <+++++> I got my wish anyway.
Did you see it? <+++++> No.
She needs an exorcist. This isn't love. This is sport-fucking. <+++++> She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way. <+++++> I don't want to hear about it, okay? That's three jobs for the night. It's over.
Spock... the booster rockets. <+++++> If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
Uh, what are those boxes? <+++++> I'm going to the store. You need anything?
You say we go? <+++++> Do not inhale.
I'm not really hungry. <+++++> C'mon. I insist.
You don't "have to." <+++++> I just want you to like me.
Pure politics! <+++++> An attempt to ruin us!
Really? <+++++> It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
'It's up to Joe', huh? <+++++> Yeah, that's what he said.
Okay. <+++++> Will you?
What? <+++++> I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie.
I'm twenty-seven. <+++++> I know.
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true? <+++++> Your vision?
And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right? <+++++> I knew he slept in a toolshed.
No... let's walk through the city. <+++++> All right...
Thoreau with a lawnmower. <+++++> I like that. But take care, Mr. Boone. Freedom is a drug, much like any other. Too much can be a very bad thing.
We've almost got your husband and your daughter out. So don't get any ideas. <+++++> They tortured us. And you're going to let them have all that money?
Walk away, Jack. <+++++> Walking away, yes, sir. Here we are walking away.
Yeah. <+++++> It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
"Liebestraum." <+++++> Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
You like? <+++++> Me like.
And your grandmother knows why. <+++++> Because God loves a winner.
She is. <+++++> But why?
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them. <+++++> Do you tell lies?
It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any. These men, they just want money, see. <+++++> What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
How do I know if this is love ? <+++++> It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?-- <+++++> --it was fine the way it was--
I ain't about to argue with you. What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies? <+++++> That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it. <+++++> Are you really that brave?
 <+++++> It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up. He's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us.
But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it. <+++++> How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
I told you I'd come back. <+++++> You did?
Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid. I know there's a problem. <+++++> I'll say there is!
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering. <+++++> You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.
But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies? <+++++> It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man. <+++++> I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me?
New York? You're not the Company President by any chance? <+++++> No ...
It's getting better and better. Keep going. <+++++> Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much. He gets right to the point.
I'm not ... <+++++> Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
He always has to make the big entrance. <+++++> By Grabthar's Hammer, this is true. 159	NT. LIVING ROOM - SOMEWHERE - NIGHT	159
Who's dead? <+++++> My mother-in-law. Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now! <+++++> Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child.
Claude. <+++++> Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The." But I could be wrong. <+++++> You can be and are wrong.
Probably just some exec ducking an ex-wife. <+++++> Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral. The father looked just like Richard. Even had a mark on his cheek.
And it's proving quite effective... <+++++> Does it make the cars any better?
It's John Bonham's birthday. <+++++> John Bonham?
She must be some girl. <+++++> I love her so bad. She just... wrecks me. I would die for her.
Of course. As soon as possible. <+++++> No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
You don't have to help me. <+++++> I know that. I do what I want.
What? <+++++> A wolf.
We've been waiting fifteen minutesÂ <+++++> You know what you can do with that! Come on, take a look at this!
This is a complicated case, your Honor... <+++++> I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.
-- what? <+++++> I don't know what gets into me.
No. I never was. <+++++> Could've fooled me. Go away.
Hold on, Ray! Half-price! Have you gone crazy? <+++++> I guess so, Pete, because that's not all. Tell them what else we've got, Egon.
Maybe I should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what it's like to sleep with you. <+++++> They wouldn't know.
I tell you -- he didn't do it. <+++++> They'll want more than your word for that.
No, my beloved, my child. <+++++> If you say so. You are innocent.
Tell me. <+++++> We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
What did he say? <+++++> He says so many fiancÃ©es.
So we'll...radiate some more? <+++++> At first. Then, after awhile, some chemo.
It that mother real? <+++++> Of course he's not real. You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?
Got yourself up? <+++++> Yeah. I'm goin' out.
Yeah, that's my pen. Why? <+++++> I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours.
NIGHT NIGHT <+++++> IT'S TIME FOR BYE-BYES IT'S BEEN A GREAT DAY THANKS A HEAP NOW IT'S TIME FOR EVERYONE TO GO TO SLEEP
So you're just packing it up just like that? <+++++> Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently.
Hunting. <+++++> When?
Have I ever told you the world is beautiful... I'd really like to play Nintendo with you, or something... <+++++> Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God. But you're a close second, tough guy. What is that smile?
Because you tell Mom everything. <+++++> No I don't. She worries about you.
It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home. <+++++> You wouldn't.
Nice! Nice little balance to it. <+++++> Ja, ja.
Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages? <+++++> I know.
Is something the matter? <+++++> Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.
No. <+++++> Are you scared?
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet. <+++++> What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care.
Have a good sleep. <+++++> Bye.
The dagger is used to free those possessed if stabbed directly into the heart, according to ancient beliefs - <+++++> By killing them?
With pleasure. <+++++> Well, that's different.
He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it. One girlfriend wasn't enough for him. <+++++> So you're a one-girl guy?
Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us... <+++++> She haven't even called you?
You can call me Simon. You're very brave to do this...  You opened it. <+++++> I just glances inside.
I have not read you your rights. <+++++> Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow! <+++++> Thanks for nothing, you bum.
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself. <+++++> I don't --  Do that stuff.
What a honeymoon. <+++++> Honeymoon temporarily canceled. The boy should still go out and exercise. I have the impression he never gets any exercise.
Merrill! <+++++> Got it!
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course! <+++++> There IS no one.
Really. With the porch swing and everything... <+++++> Surest thing you know.
And you cannot love me... <+++++> The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
Just thought I'd stop by. <+++++> Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there. <+++++> Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff. <+++++> Stay away from the Garden District. Serious crime.
Where I'm going you cannot follow. <+++++> Why are you doing this?
Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake -- <+++++> I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
I'm not really, uh. <+++++> Please! Please!
Didn't seem worried about them. <+++++> Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
... and also to bring medicine. <+++++> Chief says...
Go ahead. <+++++> I had a dream about this place.
Wasn't that hard. <+++++> Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
I didn't ask you to come away with me-- <+++++> Oh--a hundred times--
I'm sorry... you said it hurt? Why? <+++++> Because... it was the biggest I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot on their way through Jack's Fish Camp.
How long ago? <+++++> More than 800,000 years.
Why are you talking like that? <+++++> Listen to me carefully. First of all, Carl isn't here.
That's okay. I -- <+++++> I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart. <+++++> Goodbye, Daddy.
Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive. <+++++> Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
How d'ya like your room! <+++++> ...Who is this?
You don't really believe what the district attorney is saying about Miss Lawson, do you? <+++++> I don't know. It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.
You didn't, did you? You didn't bring it, did you? <+++++> Well, uh...
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street. <+++++> Finding something abnormal on the street shouldn't be too hard.
What? <+++++> When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
Thanks. <+++++> You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
To be awake is to be alive. <+++++> Hey, this is great.
He's your client, huh? <+++++> Yes, he is.
And if I go to New York, the natives there will carry me? I don't think so. <+++++> I don't think so either.
I mean the performance. Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around... <+++++> Well, teacher's away and actors will be actors...
Mama, I'm hangin' up this phone now. <+++++> No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money?
No. <+++++> Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side.
 <+++++> But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
And it's playing like gangbusters. Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph. <+++++> Shit, the press doesn't care about the facts. Cronkite's sticking it to me. It's their first big hit on Richard Nixon.
I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ... <+++++> How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money? !
Ten years ago, I sat there in that same hotel window, sweat pouring off of me waiting -- <+++++> For Nicholai?
Yes. <+++++> Yes well...  You are a credit card holder, are you not?
Big on the musical comedy, huh? <+++++> Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.
You. What do you do and what should we call you? <+++++> These days they they call me Gregor -- and I'm a tech. I do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs.
Continue. <+++++> I dove back into work, everything was fine. Until the lesions started...
 <+++++> I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go.
Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake? <+++++> Ah'm on my knees, brother, ah'm on my knees.
Well, what are we waiting for? <+++++> Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.
We want her burned as a witch! <+++++> But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...
I'm not sure what you mean. <+++++> You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
Nice threads Dad. <+++++> Yeah, I think so.
You're sure? <+++++> Yeah, I'm sure.
What's her story? <+++++> It was her coke I got busted with.
Sure. <+++++> And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?
You own a home there? <+++++> Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
Yes. He's a very careful driver. <+++++> ... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now. <+++++> What shall we do?
Rich. Reclusive. Bankrolls half a dozen charities. <+++++> Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
I'm glad you did. <+++++> So am I.
Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis. Without his country's financial aid -- <+++++> What is money? Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
SorryÂI didn't mean toÂ <+++++> Get out!
Unless the gun was slanted up. <+++++> So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
This is my wedding. <+++++> Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
Huh? <+++++> You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
I know you... Do I not? <+++++> Yes. And I know you.
.... I'm afraid there's not much left. <+++++> What was it?
I was quite enjoying that. <+++++> Good. I'm glad
I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix. <+++++> Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
I need you on this, Scully -- <+++++> You don't Mulder -- you've never needed me. I've only held you back. I've got to go.
Stop it, Sam. Stop it right now! <+++++> But, Mom...
Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be? <+++++> Stay as long as you like.
I'm in the movie business. <+++++> You're an investor, is that it?
D.A.M.O.U.R. D'Amour. Harry D'Amour. <+++++> D'Amour.
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER - <+++++> Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
Warp two... three... <+++++> Steady as she goes...
I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me. I play it back in my mind everyday. <+++++> Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
I do it all the time! <+++++> Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
I won't punish you if you get the answer wrong. I can teach and tell you: Samuel Johnson. <+++++> Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --
That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up. <+++++> That would have been quite a coincidence.
You ever given an injection before. <+++++> Thirty years ago. In residency. I passed out. You?
Can you get it a little closer? <+++++> That's what I'm going to do.
Yes. <+++++> Please... please thank the governing committee for me. I will do my utmost to merit their kindness.
They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something. <+++++> What about me?
No, sir ... <+++++> 
Petty good. <+++++> How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with- <+++++> It doesn't have eyes.
Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you. <+++++> You're going.
What's all over? <+++++> The audition.
It's the truth. Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy. We can't open -- can't make a profit without them. <+++++> We can hardly make a profit with them. Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine.
You don't know. You don't.... <+++++> If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
You can't be serious. <+++++> Can't I?
Orthopedics? <+++++> I'm just an M.D.
I can't. <+++++> She's dead isn't she?
He's on my phone. He just called me. <+++++> They can't do that to me!
Chief, don't you understand what this means? <+++++> You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
I'm engaged. I'm supposed to be married in two days. <+++++> Except possibly that.
Yes? <+++++> 
Welcome to our show! <+++++> Hack the Planet!
Fuck off. <+++++> And you were obviously getting nowhere with her. I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
Why do you need that much? <+++++> Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan... <+++++> Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it. <+++++> Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man? <+++++> Johnny Cammareri.
We're going awfully far. <+++++> I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad. <+++++> Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
I'm gonna spew. <+++++> That ought'a help the situation.
The guy is fucking insane. <+++++> I warned you, Dignan.
Is there anything in there that can blow? We have to be ready for any contingency-- <+++++> Mister Myers it is a chemical plant! There are a number of volatile compounds-- but they are safely stored away...
Nobody stole anything. They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration... <+++++> No...
I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant. <+++++> How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage. <+++++> He'll say that?
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred -- <+++++> -- You know his name is Frank.
Pete... You okay? <+++++> Yeah.
I say we head out. <+++++> Agreed--let's move it.
-- a speed manufacturer -- <+++++> So go take your job on Wall Street.
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you? <+++++> Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car.
But Corrado... If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so? <+++++> He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.
Mother! <+++++> If your father were here...
Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him-- <+++++> His mixture got screwed up. He panicked and pranged his regulator.
Out of the question. <+++++> Please let me try. I'm begging you.
No thanks. <+++++> No thanks? What does that mean? Means you ate before you came down here? All full. Is that it?
Then you'll die. <+++++> I want every second I can get with you.
You are. <+++++> I know, but that's what you like about me.
Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck. <+++++> This could all be a coincidence, but, you know something, I don't believe in coincidences. That's why I came back.
Ricky's not wearing one. <+++++> Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?
What? You mean you've got ... <+++++> Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
Left you...? Who? Emily? <+++++> This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve... <+++++> What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
Stake you? <+++++> I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand.
And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble. <+++++> Yeah I guess so. You're a neat girl.
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica? <+++++> What, they're looking for her?
Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle! <+++++> I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
You okay? <+++++> Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..." <+++++> How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby. <+++++> Why not?
What is it? I'm busy. <+++++> Just follow me.
Is that correct, Mister Harding? <+++++> Yes, that's perfectly correct.
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself. <+++++> The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like thatÂ he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury. It softens 'em up.
What are you giving me with the rabbit? <+++++> Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
Two weeks. <+++++> Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together. <+++++> What are the other reasons?
The <u>mob</u>, Bobby! <+++++> All right, look--
Yes. <+++++> Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
Dreadful. <+++++> Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
What good is this? <+++++> To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you? <+++++> Yes. I've missed it.
That's the chance we have to take. <+++++> No, we don't.
Why don't you start with that? <+++++> Yes, sir.
You didn't volunteer, Jackson. <+++++> I most likely would have, sir, had I been given the opportunity.
This is where the auditions were. <+++++> What do you mean?
You just want to ask me questions? <+++++> I just want to ask you questions.
Do you think Miss Channing would approve? <+++++> I think she would cheer.
They're coming. <+++++> Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet. Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
Any particular brand? <+++++> Well, it's for a woman.
You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in. <+++++> No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you.
How do you feel, DeJesus? <+++++> Okay.
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends... <+++++> What are you talking about? Who?
Dignan. <+++++> Anthony. Bad news.
No...! <+++++> How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops. <+++++> A situation?
It's nothing. My men take great delight in routing the enemy. Don't trouble yourself, beauty. <+++++> It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
Je...sus Christ! <+++++> I warned you!
Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth. <+++++> I'll just be a second. So what happened tonight at the office?
The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there? <+++++> Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline. Override the airlock sensors and hurry!
I think so. I was just taking a shower. <+++++> Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
Was it you? <+++++> I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
Then what do you think he was trying to do. <+++++> Let the blow drive the boat down wind. Neutralize our canvas.
Sixty pounds. <+++++> What? You sure?
You must chill! You must chill! I have hidden your keys. CHILL! <+++++> I love you man.
I want you to settle on their terms. <+++++> Mike, I don't understand. Don't ask me to do that.
You wouldn't be going in with the troops. I can guarantee your safety. <+++++> These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
I was afraid you'd say that. Hey, is there a bus station around here? <+++++> Suit yourself, Gus. Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?
You can have one. <+++++> I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
Coffee? <+++++> Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
I now the Captain meant no person- al insult. <+++++> I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species. You can assure him that's true, can't you?
They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did. <+++++> Al Capone!
They're not happy, sir. <+++++> I'm not happy.
Yes, Gaston? <+++++> What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
Soon. <+++++> Good. Our first request is that you allow us to build a road. You have no roads in Tibet. We can discuss the plans in Lhasa.
Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the way. <+++++> No way in the way! I'm talkin' back up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need you, baby.
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule? <+++++> Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
OhÂMaryÂ <+++++> Yes, sir?
Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess. <+++++> How?
Just the basics... get away from windows, don't look at it... yeah-- <+++++> Here they come.
I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy. <+++++> I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --
I think she broke the skin. <+++++> What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
-- it's just him? -- <+++++> -- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes. <+++++> Excuse me.
Sell it to him. You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride. I got a job, nice apartment. I do okay. <+++++> They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
...and I'm going to get bounced and you're... <+++++> ...let me...are you listening to me...?
I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top. <+++++> Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
You're fired. You're outta the department. <+++++> There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley.
How is it a farce? <+++++> I seen your fucking face.
You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why, it's like hiding behind a mask. <+++++> Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean?
You were afraid of him, weren't you? <+++++> He was afraid of himself. He tried suicide once. He was ill.  Manic depressive. He had wild emotional highs and lows.
Unless I make her one of us... <+++++> NO!! !
How do I offend, my lord? <+++++> By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that. <+++++> Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
--melodramatic? Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City. <+++++> What's the whole thing about--do you know?
...Were you in the service, Ed? <+++++> No, Dave, I wasn't.
What? What've I done? <+++++> Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
I remember you. <+++++> Yes, you do recall, right?
What is with you tonight? <+++++> Don't I usually kiss my wife?
But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts. <+++++> I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right? <+++++> Yeah, I know what you're saying.
This is a dead end. You took us into a dead end! <+++++> I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
We are not a saloon act. We do not take tips from dirty old men. <+++++> I was gonna split it with you guys.
I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her. <+++++> I'll do anything to help.
I would. But my suit -- <+++++> I fixed your suit.
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say? <+++++> No.
No, yes. No, I mean yes please go. Help me to be good. Come back tomorrow. Promise. <+++++> I'm going to Florida.
Stop it, Alvy! <+++++> Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.
They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they? <+++++> Waitin' in the lounge.
You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York. <+++++> He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
I bet he's pissed. <+++++> Just ignore him. You had good reason to think what you did.
is there anything you do? <+++++> Focus on the present. You always want to change the past.
We're fucked. <+++++> Darth Vader reads poetry...
Harmless - how? <+++++> Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you. <+++++> And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
You know who this Terry Malloy is? The kid brother of Charlie the Gent, Johnny Friendly's right hand, a butcher in a camel hair coat. <+++++> Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste. <+++++> Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way. <+++++> Just wait here?
I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean. <+++++> No, no. Never.
Oh, they seem all right to me. <+++++> That's what they want you to think. All coppers are villains.
 <+++++> ... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ...
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan? <+++++> No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all. <+++++> What is this, Emmi?
Captain Alexander Hamilton, sir! <+++++> Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
I took it from my fake husband. <+++++> Why point it at me? I'm the real thing.
Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise. <+++++> Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
...I'm doin' it for a friend. <+++++> Whatta you get outta this?
No, it looks good. I mean, it's cool. <+++++> Thanks.
Well, we'll ask around. Let you know if we hear of anything. <+++++> Thanks. God, I hope they're not screwed up. I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
How can I help you, Mr. Wayne? <+++++> Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.
Michael -- get off the phone. <+++++> Why?
Why, yeah. <+++++> I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby? <+++++> You could give me my gun back.
Leave me alone. <+++++> Benny was right. You guys are all exactly the same.
 <+++++> You just got hit. The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn...
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight. <+++++> Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
No. <+++++> Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
God, I think Josh is too mature for us. <+++++> I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
I'll have to enclose the check first. <+++++> You do and I'll fire you.
He's coming to. <+++++> Let's get his clothes off quick.
Now I remember why I went into theoretical work. Kent. <+++++> Glad to have you, David. How's the new office?
No coke tonight. Right? <+++++> Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
Six rounds. 357. <+++++> That's what it looks like, doesn't it?
Is Tim there? <+++++> He's in the bathroom.
Because if you're uncomfortable with the EPA up your ass, try the IRS ... <+++++> Well, goddamn. Are you threatening me, Dick?
Great. <+++++> From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big.
Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me. <+++++> I would like to marry you. But I have already promised myself... to God.
No. They're just coming to me. <+++++> Well, you're doing great. Keep it up.
Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away. <+++++> Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy. <+++++> What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
You're a bank robber? <+++++> Nope. I've never robbed a bank.
Why do you want to know my name? <+++++> Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
Ready for round two? <+++++> I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him. Let him sweat for a little while.
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos. <+++++> Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
Well, I don't get on so well most places. <+++++> I see. That beer made me dizzy.
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag. <+++++> Melanie must be dyin' to see it. Louis.
Well, no... <+++++> Then that's all you had to say.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone. <+++++> Mister, I'm calling you out.
What? <+++++> It's private.
 <+++++> That's the hair color in his profile?
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again. <+++++> But why destroy a star? Thank you, Guinan.
Hey-Ho... ! Maybe we're not alone in this thing after all. <+++++> Who is that... ?
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one? <+++++> Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower. <+++++> No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
It's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck? <+++++> Yes.
Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him. <+++++> Oh, I wasn't worrying. I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
NEVER! <+++++> Then it must've been love --
What? <+++++> The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P.
This seat taken? <+++++> Thank you.
Hey. <+++++> Sit down a minute.
Cancel that, Dieter. <+++++> What? Why?
Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can. <+++++> If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs? <+++++> Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
My name is Honeycutt and I want to try something different. Can you do this for me? <+++++> Yeah!
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home? <+++++> I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate? ! <+++++> ...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
I'll live. <+++++> Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin.
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten. <+++++> What's her name?
I need some information. Thought you might be able to help. <+++++> Thomas Welles. Nice picture.
What will happen if I do? <+++++> Someone will talk to your daddy. And then he'll stop doing those things... the things you don't like.
Why didn't he? <+++++> Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
Supposing we could get out of this room? Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge? <+++++> It depends on the condition of the ship.
She's in the holding cell, on this floor. <+++++> You're taking us to that holding cell now. All right, Cut!
Shakespeare never said that. <+++++> How do you know?
Yeah ... Sort of ... <+++++> We'll get you fixed up in no time.
You have a job? <+++++> I have several jobs.
Don't interfere. <+++++> You're bleeding, man. You can't make it.
Of course. <+++++> Were you in love with any of them?
Use your influence with Paul. Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table. <+++++> I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
What did you, take a nap in math class? Three people, three shares, one third. Four point six six six repeating. <+++++> I'm just saying, the man is a problem. And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
Twelve have a mission within the week. <+++++> This time I will supervise each test personally.
Good morning, my lord! <+++++> Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!
Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas. <+++++> It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.
What C-4...was Cox talking about? <+++++> 
Why? Why would she? <+++++> The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
What the hell is that? <+++++> That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.
CQ what? <+++++> Close Quarters Combat. Keep one in my own home.
You're late. <+++++> Didn't get much sleep.
Nice to meet you, Fergus. <+++++> My pleasure, Jody
Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days? <+++++> For Ellie's birthday, yes.
Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side? <+++++> Huge.
Don't you think of it, fucker. <+++++> Why not?
'They won't.' <+++++> 'Believe in yourself and they will. Let me ask you, Lizzie. Look in the mirror? Are you pretty --?'
You have grown up very good. <+++++> And you have grown older and your chin has grown balder.
I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more. <+++++> It don't matter. It's my reputation. These guys think they can get off light.
Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl! <+++++> Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?
So what are you thinking for college? <+++++> College. Haven't really thought about it.
Been working on a poem. It's about you. Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em. <+++++> I'd like to read it some time.
Doesn't fit. <+++++> This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?
Y'ever look at yoself in the mirror Junior, youse uglier than a dick on a dog man. <+++++> Yeah, you had a piece of pussy on a plate in front of you, you'd probably kill it.
Hope you get to where you're going. <+++++> Thanks. Hope you do too.
 <+++++> Linda, you're safe. Ok. It's alright. You're my friend.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory. <+++++> It's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better.
And what does that make you? <+++++> The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you...  You're a jealous man Jake.
What? <+++++> That tuba player!
I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head. I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy. <+++++> But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
What an odd pairing. <+++++> It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars! <+++++> I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off! <+++++> Bobo, no, I --
Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble -- <+++++> --- don't. don't. Please. Just... listen to me...honey.... ...I've done...I've cheated on you.
Abso... <+++++> Where have you been, Shelly? Bruce and Harriet Nyborg. Do you want to see the memos...?
You want something? <+++++> Yeah I want something. I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh? <+++++> It's her home! It's where she lives! !
Goddamit, Dodge. <+++++> What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened?
Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her. <+++++> What do you mean?
I do!! ! <+++++> I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
 <+++++> Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
You're happy for me and Victor. <+++++> I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that. <+++++> Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
 <+++++> ...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing:  There's no gold down there.
Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender? <+++++> May<u>be</u>.
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect. <+++++> Yeah... almost. You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
Where have you been hiding? <+++++> Oh--hello! I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
He did? <+++++> Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy. <+++++> I have a cinnamon bar.
Now left and that's it in front of you. <+++++> Good.
It costs. <+++++> I've no money.
Beaumont worked for you. <+++++> That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me?
Yeah, Kay? <+++++> Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
Are you bringing your laundry woman? <+++++> Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin. My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
Did you reach the next girl yet? <+++++> No. Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
Is this yours, Larry? Is this your homework, Larry? <+++++> Is the car out front yours?
And where is that. <+++++> It will be brought to me and placed at my feet.
Hmm... you two in high school together? <+++++> Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten. I'll be right down. <+++++> He's gonna come up with ten thousand, just the way you wanted.
You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing. <+++++> No.
I think so. <+++++> I like him. I think he's a sweet guy.
Will it help to get you out? <+++++> I hope so!
Did you see that shit? Motherfucker. You let in fucking Screech, dude? I'm waiting and you let in Screech? <+++++> He's on the list.
Rowan...? <+++++> Listen. Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
An evil petting zoo? <+++++> You always do that! Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
Yes. <+++++> Come with me.
If you wouldn't mind. <+++++> Thank you.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that? Huh? <+++++> You're ruthless.
You're officer of the watch, George. <+++++> I'm sorry, Skip. It's this damned book. Lawford gave it to me.
C-connection? <+++++> I'm not looking to pinch you! I don't care about you, or the girl.
That ain't me. <+++++> It's not?
Yes. <+++++> You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
You mean that hitch-hiker? Little short fella with a pale face? <+++++> I guess that's what he looked like.
What... ? <+++++> When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia? <+++++> Not held, just slowed down.
If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me. <+++++> He will. But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings. You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.
Yes, actually. <+++++> Use caution.
What are you afraid of? What people think? <+++++> I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons! <+++++> Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
How long you been out here for now, anyway? Three months? <+++++> Four.
What do you want from me? <+++++> I . I don't know.
What's with the fish thing -- ? <+++++> We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
Ask me a question I would normally lie to. <+++++> Are we going to die?
I read you were shot five times in the tabloids. <+++++> That's not true. He never came near my tabloids. That's one thing I always protect... my tabloids.
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions. <+++++> Really?
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs. <+++++> A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
Well, George, who were you? <+++++> I? You all know my history.
Gotta go, Arletta. <+++++> Laugh it up, kid. You'll make out.
 <+++++> She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."
Well, let's see, we've got double A's -- <+++++> Watch yourself! !
The Empire State in fog means something, don't it? Do you know, or don't you? What is your number, cabbie? <+++++> Have you tried the telephone?
All night. <+++++> Well... who are those guys?
Quit screwing around, this is important. <+++++> It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
What you need is some relaxation. <+++++> Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink.
Gay. <+++++> Oh. Well, you're...certainly welcome!
... A cloaking device? <+++++> Red alert, Mr. Scott.
Oh. So... what brings you down here? <+++++> Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.
Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked. <+++++> Why'd you go into business with him?
There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis. <+++++> You're telling me.
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month. <+++++> You think Maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager?
It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be. <+++++> What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
What, um...  What do we do? <+++++> There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain. Marty's a good man, Brian. <+++++> Yeah...
Oh God. <+++++> What's going to happen?
That's it. My client doesn't have to take this crap from you. <+++++> Sit down, Frank.
There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along. <+++++> And the rent is okay?
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded. <+++++> It's a little cut, nothing.
She doesn't even want to leave the house. <+++++> Really?
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again. <+++++> Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
Lock the door. <+++++> No, I wanna say hi.
You've been shadowing the family for thirty years. It's only fitting you give one af us away. <+++++> I've grown very fond of you you and Michael both.
He flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her! <+++++> God, yes!
Very well, Your Majesty. Congratulations, Frank. He picked you. <+++++> No, no, that one.
I see where you're going. <+++++> Think about it.
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden. <+++++> That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
How was your day, today, sir? <+++++> Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
Oh, no. Now what? <+++++> Must be a circuit breaker.
Don't cry, Elizabeth. <+++++> Aren't you?
Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message. <+++++> Of course I'm here. Today is the file clerk's big scene.
Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've found natural locations for the whole story-- <+++++> Hold on a sec. I got news. We finally found somewhere to premiere KANE but--
A little. <+++++> This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
I've got to finish it. <+++++> Finish what?
Sure did. <+++++> Everything went to his head.
I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy. Never a thank you note. He forgets my wife at Christmas time - <+++++> He's got no style, we all know that. So, we should hang him for it?
Why not? There's been a murder. <+++++> First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
What's with Mike? <+++++> He got a little jealous.
Any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming --  How many charter members are there in this little club of yours? <+++++> Just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise.
Fuckin' A. <+++++> I don't think so.
 <+++++> Karma.
Nonsense, it's all of our home. So how's work treating you? <+++++> Frustrating. Form over content. Everything's so retro.
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it. <+++++> But she might be in trouble...
He did more work on the car. He wants fifty bucks extra for it. <+++++> Fifty dollars more. That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from?
All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool. <+++++> I also gotta win.
 <+++++> I can't believe Eve said those things!
Holy shit, I'm a freak. <+++++> You are not Frida, we all have a little hair there. I didn't even notice till you showed me.
That's why I asked you... <+++++> 
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer. <+++++> Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
Occasionally <+++++> How is he these days?
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid! <+++++> Hey. This is my business. Do I tell you your business.
Forget it, Donny. You're out of your element. <+++++> This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone. <+++++> Catch me letting you go alone!
We were married two years before the baby. And then four very difficult years. <+++++> So, you were a failure at the longest, most important relationship in your life.
Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him? <+++++> No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it.
Because she's sick. <+++++> Because she's sick.
This job... Do it if it's what you really want. <+++++> I appreciate that.
Whatta you think, Chill? <+++++> That's not bad. I think you got it down.
He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test. <+++++> So I'm still ...
I was with Max when he got the call. <+++++> And you came all the way down here to see me?
Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again. <+++++> Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.
What are you talking about? <+++++> That's what I want to know.
Certainly... <+++++> By the book...
Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere. <+++++> Whatever... stella.
All the rib eyes? <+++++> Yep.
You'll see those committees when we're finished! <+++++> Yes, Jim.
Patrizia, what are you going to do? <+++++> What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.
Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking. <+++++> Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on.
Louis, you're a life saver. <+++++> I know.
Want to buy a bed? <+++++> Not much.
I'm fine. <+++++> Well, I'll tell you what I think.
What about... <+++++> What about what?
I don't have a girlfriend -- <+++++> -- you said you did.
You seem to have had a reason for every other question. <+++++> No, not for that one.
You want me to pump? <+++++> No, stay in the car. I want you to understand something. If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
Remember how we were? <+++++> Not like this. We were never like this. I want to go over there. After dinner, we can--
Find it? <+++++> Yes, under "U.S. Government." Now we need directions.
For work..... <+++++> I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
When are you going to take off that mask? <+++++> When I am sure I am among friends.
Oh my God...  You're blushing. <+++++> It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room. <+++++> Why didn't you clean it out? *
We got -- I don't know, we got separated <+++++> Before or after the explosion? Mueller --
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds? <+++++> To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
What else? <+++++> A flat-out hit.
My brother died over there last November. Why? What good was his death? <+++++> I know. I know. I've seen a lot of kids die, too, in World War II.
I don't know. <+++++> Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
I see. This is going to be a very polite conversation. What shall we discuss? The weather? Movies? <+++++> Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
But you? You got the killing in you, boy. <+++++> Shut up.
Do you see the kids? <+++++> Probably out in the back yard.
I'm concerned about her health. <+++++> Who was that person Mother? Was it you?
Cabin fever, hon? <+++++> I can't clean anything. The vacuum is out in the garage. I can't leave the house. Why don't they tell us something?
It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine. <+++++> Elsa, don't cross the Seal. The Knight warned us not to take the Grail from here.
Why? <+++++> Because I'm done.
Cavity search...? <+++++> Deep and hard.
Beidermeyer? <+++++> Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.
That's unlikely. <+++++> The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
Huh, right, manifesto? "You may stop me, but you can't stop us all." <+++++> Now that's cool.
When? <+++++> Tomorrow?
Where? <+++++> Ossining Correctional Facility. Sing Sing. Everybody's innocent there, man... Just ask 'em...
Hello. <+++++> Hi, it's me. Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
Of course you do. I can see you're anxious for me to get to the point. Well Dude, here it is. Where's Bunny? <+++++> I thought you might know, man.
You know, this horse smells really bad. <+++++> There's worse things.
Okay, good. I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than -- <+++++> You're not gonna be there.
Yeah! <+++++> But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help. <+++++> And the ten thousand?
Well, I guess I'd better go - <+++++> It's been delightful meeting you both.
Three years. <+++++> I'm telling you, Bob,  it's a gift. When you got a Ferrari you don't leave it in the garage.
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure. <+++++> But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?
Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise? <+++++> I don't think I like the idea of you staying out all night with a girl!
William Harcourt? <+++++> Yes...
I think if you saw a chance to get out from under... you'd unload this place... <+++++> This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there.
Nothing. <+++++> I heard something. A squeal.
MMMMMPHPHPHPHP!!!! ! <+++++> Fallen one... We have such sights to show you!
--yeah, a hand or something-- <+++++> --coming out of the water--
Why you shaking me off? <+++++> I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
That's right, it's Nuwanda. <+++++> And are we just playing around out here or do we mean what we say?
Beautiful night huh? <+++++> Yeah.....Hey they're moving....  Am I doing that?
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping. <+++++> Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Maybe we should give him some water. <+++++> All last night he could have been--
Dahlia, no. <+++++> Now why is that?
No, I mean <+++++> -- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
That's not it. <+++++> Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
Take your time. I wish I had. <+++++> We will.
The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict. <+++++> You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
 <+++++> Was it a nice funeral?
What's that? <+++++> _Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor.
Know what this is? <+++++> Sure. It's a wind-up... thing.
Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea. <+++++> And look what happened to that.
Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out. <+++++> And you've got me all figured out?
Is this a bad time? <+++++> She'll live. If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
Yes...That's Aunt Em. <+++++> Her -- her name is Emily.
Right. <+++++> And you need money?
BREAKING OUT <+++++> BREAKING OUT
Yes. <+++++> Don't shit where you eat.
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed? <+++++> I know--but you--you're going to help.
Him too. <+++++> We've got to get you to a hospital.
With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service. <+++++> I do, sir.
And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you? <+++++> Sure
Who were you talking to? ! <+++++> You're the one talking to the walls!
No goodbye. No fuck you. No 'Are you in love with George?' <+++++> What did he say?
How was I ridiculing you? <+++++> You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
I haven't bothered to ask you any questionsÂIÂ  Isn't all this what you wanted? You haven't changed your mind about King, have you? <+++++> Oh, no.
No. <+++++> You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
Ah. The director of "Glen Or Glenda." <+++++> H-how'd you know? !
Sure thing. <+++++> You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep.
And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry! <+++++> Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me. <+++++> Uh, I'm not. Sam, I wouldn't...
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon. <+++++> You can't visit me here. I want my lawyer.
Well, I saw you and-- <+++++> Yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn't have any problem.
Business to finish. Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara. I might be able to pick up some action there. <+++++> So, what is it you do, Mister...?
Llewelyn! <+++++> What? Quit hollerin'.
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark. <+++++> All right. Stand by.
Well, the studio told me not to. <+++++> Is that why you did it?
Doubt it. <+++++> Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
Get the outside shutters. <+++++> What are we doing?
It's a long walk. <+++++> I got time, Bert.
You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened! <+++++> Something happened. Because your eyes? Are very cold? They're very cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes.
Nothing, really... <+++++> The kid - junior, that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...
Not a very happy poem. <+++++> You didn't look very happy.
Hey, watcha doing with that dog? <+++++> He yours, sir?
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now. <+++++> Scan for vessels in pursuit!
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship? <+++++> Tonight?
Nonsense! <+++++> Anybody here who's interested in what Melvin has to say raise their hands.
Good. Where are we? <+++++> Some committee's got it.
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet. <+++++> Equally incongruous is Oswald becoming chummy with the White Russian community of Dallas - all rabid anti- Communists.
I don't need any help. <+++++> Yes you do. Something's on with you. You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
Talk to us about it... <+++++> It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days. <+++++> What makes her think that?
No, you're tripping. Don't come in Sal's. Alright, read my lips. <+++++> What are you so worked up about?
You ready on shore? <+++++> We're ready.
She started shrieking, you know. <+++++> Jezhush.
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you. <+++++> Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
What exactly is your project, Vaughan? ~ book of crashes? A medical study? A sensational documentary? Global traffic? <+++++> It's something we're all intimately involved in: The reshaping of the human body by modern technology.
 <+++++> Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!
Thirty-seven. Thirty-seven. <+++++> What?
That: in an act of... <+++++> Yes...
Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me...  ...for somethin' I done in the old days. <+++++> I could of... easy.
So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day. <+++++> You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
The guy died. <+++++> What killed him?
I could go for a Whopper. <+++++> Let's hit "Kelly's."
Who else? <+++++> Pass.
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you. <+++++> I bet 235. Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt...
Excellent. <+++++> Your usual table, sir?
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all. <+++++> No, Faith. They came out of somebody's imagination.
Nervous? <+++++> A little.
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you? <+++++> It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
Good. <+++++> The sub-heading is, "Brown & Williamson Has a 500-Page Dossier Attacking Chief Critic."
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men. <+++++> And you believe it?
Ernie. <+++++> ... Ernie.
Where is she going? <+++++> Ask her.
Your honor, may I approach the bench? <+++++> Yes.
What's wrong with how I carry myself. <+++++> Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge? <+++++> Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
Hardapple? <+++++> I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
Okay. And did we know each other? <+++++> Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods. Thanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so that Buzz takes the untainted whip. Theo takes the other glass. <+++++> Thanks.
May I come in? <+++++> What you want?
The napkin will keep. I'd rather not be alone. <+++++> Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
It wasn't your fault, Alex. <+++++> Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now. The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?
What's this guy's problem? <+++++> I have no idea.
Get it? ! <+++++> Seat 74.
River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden. <+++++> I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake. <+++++> What're you talking about? You earned it --
An Oldsmobile Silhouette. <+++++> I reserved a Cadillac.
Thanks, but no thanks. <+++++> Against your code?
Hi. Lloyd Dobler, sir. Pleasure to meet you. <+++++> Hello Lloyd.
Then what did she do? <+++++> Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but since I'm gonna write about it I might as well tell you.
Blow me. <+++++> Call me later.
You have no whiskey? <+++++> No whiskey, no spirits. Your rich cockroaches at the hotel, they will have to do without their scotch.
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest... <+++++> Jimmy Squarefoot no lost.
Look. I'll see you tonight, OK? <+++++> OK.

"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . "How big is it, all told? The estate? <+++++> The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
Slide the shotgun over here, put your hands behind your head, put your forehead on the floor. <+++++> Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
What kind of a deal? <+++++> Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
I thought you liked being on TV. <+++++> I do. How many escapes? This year alone: five!
Yes. <+++++> 
I was flying...my responsibility. <+++++> That's what you get flight pay for.
About what? <+++++> About Cheesy Poofs, dumbass! This whole thing has gone too far!
yeah. <+++++> Ok. So you were married for how long?
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to. <+++++> Oh, Sandro... I want everything you do. But...
You don't understand. You don't know what's going to happen. <+++++> I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING F... <+++++> The disc is still in there.

Who is it? <+++++> It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the San Francisco Police Department.
Look, look. You can't stop her for speeding? I mean, look what the hell she's doing. <+++++> Speeding?
The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears. <+++++> How long will that be?
Insurance! <+++++> You actually sold insurance!
The conductor got so excited he yelled, "There's sabotage in the string section!" <+++++> Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
I'm tired of this. <+++++> Almost through.
Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake. I mean... <+++++> A mistake? To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry?
How can I serve you in this? <+++++> Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is.
What about? <+++++> All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.

Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea. <+++++> What a beautiful thought.
Yes, Mikey? <+++++> I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her. <+++++> Why, why do you think that is?
It was this war. Viet Nam. Doesn't matter. <+++++> Were you in it? In the war?
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to. <+++++> Want to kill yourself? Are you saying that you're drinking as a way to kill yourself?
You have to do it. <+++++> I refuse.
That's great, Harry. So what's the -- <+++++> What she did not say was, 'I just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin' seasick.'
Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone. <+++++> Move on. Right. That's what I'm going to do.

This is the best score yet. <+++++> It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
Didn't we play this scene before? <+++++> Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
Fuck you, Dave... <+++++> "You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"
You seem fine now. <+++++> Great! You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
What'll I do if something comes up? <+++++> Settle it yourself. What have I got a lawyer for?
He'll learn. <+++++> He's too old. Yes. Too old to start the training.
You want to take a walk with me? <+++++> Where to?
Don't bullshit me, Laurant! I know about the Van Gogh. <+++++> I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.

Sir? <+++++> You having hearing problems, mister?

Excuse me? <+++++> I said, I'm not my sister.

There's always a bright side. <+++++> I'm listening, sir.
Maybe we should just leave -- <+++++> Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
You think? <+++++> Mmmm. Yes. I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.
Witch. <+++++> Tramp.
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons. <+++++> You could have them here by daybreak.
Better now than later. We'll still be friends. I'm dying here. <+++++> Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?

Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls. <+++++> You just gonna leave 'em?
You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him. <+++++> There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center.
I know. <+++++> Just one word of advice for next season.
Sure. What do you want to know. <+++++> People say he was a murderer.
No, I - Mike - wyncha sit over there, I'd prefer that. <+++++> Huh? Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man. <+++++> Hey! You don't know me --
Thanks. Steel pipes and baseball bats. <+++++> They play pretty rough.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat. <+++++> You got a good memory, Franky.
I already made you two tapes. <+++++> Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
No. <+++++> The last one, please.
Have you known her long? <+++++> I was married to her sister ..
....Why does he do it...? <+++++> Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog. <+++++> I already have, my dear.
Don't worry about that, that's my department. Now who do we cast? We need a star. Can Whoopi sing or dance? <+++++> I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like? <+++++> I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
I feel like an idiot. You were right. I did fuck you. And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too. <+++++> I heard.
Sure. <+++++> Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here. I mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty.
Great. So what are you guys working on? <+++++> Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
I've got a weak signal over there. <+++++> Split up. Find him.
Why are the shutters closed? <+++++> Someone jammed gum in the locks.

But why? Why here? <+++++> Madeleine died here.
Tell you what. I'm gonna go get Rex for you right now. You know home isn't far from here, right? <+++++> Right 'cross the freeway.
Yes, sir. <+++++> Now Rose, stop behaving as if you're Bo Peep.
What happened?! Jesus, Connie, what did you do? <+++++> Nothin'! I told him he was great.
Yes! God yes! I would tell her that I love her! To not let anyone take away her dreams..! <+++++> You should grab her and shake her                           ] and tell her it's a goddamn war out                         ] there.
Good God. <+++++> They suggested oranges.
All these in the last year? <+++++> You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.
You don't like Eve, do you? <+++++> Do you want an argument or an answer?
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to-- <+++++> Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
What do you mean? What did I do to you... <+++++> Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it. <+++++> Used to what?
You said "of course" you'd need the donkey. Why "of course"? <+++++> We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before.
Are you in love with someone else? <+++++> My God! Wha-what is this? The Gestapo? No.
Gotta go. <+++++> Right.
Does it hurt? <+++++> Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
"Gritty"? Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant? <+++++> I don't know...  Maybe. Think of it as an adventure.
Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you. <+++++> You were supposed to be reading words.
No kidding. NO KIDDING! <+++++> And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street.
And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand? <+++++> Yes.
Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark? <+++++> Aye. Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
A good time! Is that all you care about? ! <+++++> I wouldn't know. I've never had one.
Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm retired. I'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man. <+++++> Editorials?
Whaddyamean 'maybe'? <+++++> That's what he said.
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice? <+++++> Well...
I'll be fine. <+++++> You'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.
Actually, yes. <+++++> Hmmm.
I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating. <+++++> Very well put.
The Joe Boys in 1980...! <+++++> 
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut. <+++++> I had to tell 'em something.
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right? <+++++> I can't discuss another patient. You know that. Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
Why don't you just go now, okay? <+++++> I told you I'm not easily shocked.
Stay with me tonight. Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to. <+++++> I do. I do want to. That's why I'm leaving. That's what you given me, see?
At least we'll have a house to show for it. <+++++> Forget it, really. I'll survive.
She was damaged and unstable. The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became. Finally, she showed up at the new house... <+++++> How did she know where it was?
He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA. <+++++> This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific! He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
And I would pledge to you all that I still own: muscle, bone, blood and the heart that pumps it. <+++++> And a great heart it is. Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion.
Darren, we better turn around. <+++++> Why?
That's too bad. You would have been the first one in the family. <+++++> I know.
We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday. He's gonna hand me 500 bucks. <+++++> What Friday?
Really? You sure? <+++++> Sure I'm sure. What is this?
I don't know what that means. <+++++> Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
Time's be coming, my man, when de black man's gonna throw off that yoke. <+++++> Say I can dig it. Smoke that shit everything kinda gets weird y'know?
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner. <+++++> What?
You. You see how...I... I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any... <+++++> What? You can't do any what?
We could use a little help. <+++++> With the F.B.I. there's no such thing as a little help. They bury you with help.
I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me. <+++++> Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do. <+++++> Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
Are you okay? <+++++> Get away from me!
Okay, I'll take it all. <+++++> Excellent. we accept MasterCard and American Express.
How do you mean? <+++++> How much do you know?
What about it? <+++++> "Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird. <+++++> I-it's all right, Mrs. Brewster. It was just a sea-gull. Er. nothing's happened yet! No, I'm watching.
Have you heard? <+++++> No, I haven't heard.
I. Yes. It is. <+++++> And you wrote that...
Mr. Webster -- you will help him? <+++++> I'll do my best, Mary.
I seen the angel of death Ned, an' I seen the river. He's a snake, he got... snake eyes. <+++++> Who, Bill? Who got snake eyes?
I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough-- <+++++> I have a B average.
Who is this, Metal-lick-a? <+++++> Metallica, Dad. Come on.
Uh...sure...I...what? <+++++> Sushi.
You're welcome. Did you find them? <+++++> Sort of.
That's so typical, isn't it? <+++++> It's just strange. One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
Say what, Manray? <+++++> Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
Yes, I do have something to say. I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you. <+++++> I'm listening.
Too bad I couldn't see this guy first. I'm pretty particular about whom my wife marries. <+++++> Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
Alright we're clear. <+++++> Anything new?
Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire. <+++++> On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down. See what your son did?
I just want to talk. <+++++> We have nothing to say! You are a rotten bastard, that's what!
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler. <+++++> Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
Hey, baby, it's cool. Captain just reassigned me to the Feds. <+++++> The Feds? !
No, I'm not. <+++++> In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
What the hell are you doing there? <+++++> Did you and your sister often take naps together?
No. <+++++> Close it!
-- I don't deserve this. I'm still young, this is not my time -- <+++++> That's what everybody says.
What were they hiding from? <+++++> Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.
Almost married. And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton... <+++++> Excuse me?
Sister Mary Clarence. And you're... young Christians. I guess I should assign you this passage. What's good? What were you talking about? <+++++> We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.
Something he said, just before... <+++++> He spoke to you?
. . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent. <+++++> Gee guys, that's swell of you. But  . . . I've got another idea.
LetÂs go. <+++++> I donÂt know what your problem is, but...
So I'll die without a son. <+++++> Put on your blue suit...
Why can't we wait here for a ride? <+++++> I feel better if I move.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics. <+++++> That's the old Rick!
Where are his pants? <+++++> Who knows?
I can't tell you, Amy. You know I can't. You have to trust me... <+++++> Tom...
You are not my priest, Aramis! You would not be, even if I had one. <+++++> You are bitter, Athos.
I was impressed. <+++++> Oh?
Where'd it come from before that? <+++++> From God.
 <+++++> What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
You drove him to his torment. <+++++> And he drove me to mine.
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth. <+++++> Is Tony the one that tells you things?
Sorry, honey, I... <+++++> That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
ON THE MEN, IN THE ROOM, ARGUING ABOUT THE ILLEGAL ALIEN, SCHUMANN IN THE B.G. <+++++> WHERE'S MY FUCKING <u>PIIIILLLLLLL</u>...?
You kids off to the dance? <+++++> Aren't you coming?
Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up? <+++++> Starting tonight?
Atley Jackson came to see me ... <+++++> Atley Jackson. How is that one? How's the leg... ?
Where were you, Whistler? <+++++> I'll show you.
There they go. Look kinda like preachers. <+++++> Yeah. Or undertakers.
Who are you? <+++++> Now, really -
Not good enough, swear to God. <+++++> I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
Wuddya got for me Â what the hell happened to your face? <+++++> Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
She said they were from her old convent. <+++++> But... she was a showgirl. She didn't have an old convent.
How can one man possibly be so selfish? <+++++> We held a mirror up to the Doctor, and -- apparently -- he didn't like what he saw.
I can't let myself fall in love with you. <+++++> That goes double for me.
Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly... <+++++> What about surface life signs...?
Dammit! <+++++> Sorry, sir.
Henryk, I said nothing bad. <+++++> What's the matter with you all? Have you lost your sense of humour?
I have eighteen more minutes! <+++++> I don't want to hear any more today.
She's right. We should stick together. <+++++> Alright. Come on, you guys.
Can I go with you today? <+++++> You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay?
Three... Rudy got ambitious. <+++++> And you got him...
Now,  let's say the whole country. Was in that car. The entire United States of America. <+++++> In the car?
It's a puzzle box. If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside. <+++++> For real? A treasure?
What the hell did you do, move all the furniture? <+++++> Why didn't you turn on the light?
I just fnished work. I counted the bags. <+++++> We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church.
Where were the flashlights? <+++++> Screw the flashlights. Where the hell were you?
Everywhere. Where is the food? <+++++> It's coming -- I rode on ahead. I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...
Now it seems to me -- <+++++> Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear?
Not for three-fifty. <+++++> How about for five hundred?
Ringo! <+++++> Wake up!
These are beautiful. How's the case coming? <+++++> Okay.
That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat. Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you. <+++++> Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
I'm so glad you're here. <+++++> I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin.
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you? <+++++> Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr.Marx, of course...
Thanks. <+++++> Good argument for gun-control. What are you going after, rhino?
What? <+++++> What? Oh. A film.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk." <+++++> Really.
I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever. <+++++> Oh yeah?
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork. <+++++> You're right. Good.
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear. <+++++> Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley? <+++++> I give up. Who are you?
What did you ask me? <+++++> What?
...Why, this is worthless. <+++++> Huh?! But, buddy --
He works in a military hospital. <+++++> No.
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door. <+++++> Okay?
Exactly. <+++++> Richard, you know something -
What are they for? <+++++> They're paramedics. They wait at 180 feet.
Madison lives two blocks from their present location. <+++++> Why would they be going there?
You're in Kinship? <+++++> Yes. But that's not why I called...
No thanks. <+++++> Ah, come on.
Talia, just because you happen to be Jewish, doesn't mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord's body... <+++++> Yes, it does.
Where is he? <+++++> We're too late. Take a look.
There are only three or four left. <+++++> Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F8-88 Cargo Trawler.
Think we'll get him, Nick? <+++++> We can't lose.
Tired? <+++++> You pay me.
Who's Tony? <+++++> Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it? <+++++> I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight. <+++++> 
Yes. <+++++> What's your name?
Oh, for Chrissakes here - <+++++> Blood has been shed. We've incurred risks, Jerry. I'm coming into town tomorrow. Have the money ready.
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas. <+++++> Merry Christmas.
Okay. Okay. <+++++> 
So? <+++++> Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
He <u>knew</u> about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down -- <+++++> Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
Where are you from? <+++++> Southern California.
It's a perfect Kaufman audience. <+++++> Yeah. They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
Yeah. <+++++> I think about you. I mean, a lot.
Can you feel it, Poppy? The presence of the moment? Can you feel the weight of its significance? <+++++> Oh yes, Icky. I can feel it.
Why not? He has good teeth... <+++++> Because... because you just can't!
If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway? <+++++> I'm not very bright, I guess.
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong. <+++++> I'm not going to report it.
I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere. <+++++> Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it? <+++++> Saunders said--this whole thing was *his* idea to get graft--!
A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank. <+++++> I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
Where have you been the last few weeks? <+++++> Marla?
And the Senate supports you? <+++++> I have dissolved the Senate.
Yes it was all you -- <+++++> Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
Don't you know it! <+++++> BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
You make them work for you. <+++++> Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago. Everything's proceeding exactly as planned. <+++++> You don't know that. There could still be people inside.
Studio B. <+++++> Hi. This is Heather Langenkamp.
What is it? <+++++> It's nothing, Doc. Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
I think he knows that Joey. <+++++> Good! So maybe he also know where the hell am I going to get the parts I need...
Live happily ever after. <+++++> Maybe.
Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves. <+++++> So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
Who are you protecting, then? <+++++> Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by. <+++++> Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
Who? <+++++> She's been out of movies a few years, but she's good. Real good.
By the X. <+++++> Some more make-up wouldn't do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out.
But not you. <+++++> Oh, God! Do you hear a buzzing? Is there a buzzing?
It's not in the river, is it Harry? <+++++> Answer me!
You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back? <+++++> Stop it --
The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back? <+++++> Give it back? Are you nuts?
We have at least three months' work left. We can't write a report...We don't know enough.... <+++++> We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas. There's never been one down here before.
I can track down and deliver these crooks to you... for a small finder's fee of course.</i> <+++++> How much?
Uh, Uncle Ben, I-- <+++++> What, want a glass?
No. <+++++> Can I give you my testimony?
Talking's good, walking's better. <+++++> Sleeping's better.
As a heart attack. <+++++> Thanks -- Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful here...
I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe... <+++++> Here's my number.
I threw up. <+++++> That's okay. Listen, give me your hand.
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson. <+++++> You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff. Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again. <+++++> They blamed my family for everything. They always said Mr. Langston saved Anthony's life.
It's a sign that you're crazy! Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is? <+++++> What's gonna go wrong?! I take your place for the royal inspection.
Back and forth, this one and that one, and, in the meantime, she's gone anyway. Am I right? <+++++> I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God. <+++++> If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
It's not -- what's a 422? <+++++> It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.
Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with? <+++++> Sure, why not. Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch. You heard him, Norman.

No, on the porch. <+++++> Oh yeah, and then what?
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name? <+++++> Steve.
Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far. <+++++> Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
Aren't they great? <+++++> Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
How'm I supposed to turn this thing? <+++++> By hand. Like the pioneers did.
I'll rephrase the question. <+++++> Thank you.
A real live pimp? <+++++> Uh-huh.
Did you get the case for the securities? <+++++> Yes, sir.
I guess it isn't. <+++++> Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
His mixture got screwed up. He panicked and pranged his regulator. <+++++> But what did he see that made him panic?
I guess so. Thank you, Carter. <+++++> You take care of yourself, Lee.
I don't want to discuss it. <+++++> Then why do you keep asking about it?
Six weeks! <+++++> It's a nightmare.
Don't worry, I've got a permit for it. <+++++> Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat. <+++++> You keep a bat under your seat?
The parcelÂs in the post. <+++++> ItÂs heading for the oil terminal.
I didn't forget. <+++++> But, Amy, that was just a story; it wasn't real. That tree's no mailbox.
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault. <+++++> I assume full responsibility.
Yes. <+++++> Sometimes a story is a mask for a covert operation.
Max, the cab driver! <+++++> Max? Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage! Do ve call you hot dogs? Ve call you Yanks not franks! <+++++> All right. Finish the job. Let's get outta here.
That's fabulous Harry. <+++++> Yeah, it was wild.
Yes? <+++++> He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
Can I have your name please? <+++++> Dante Hicks. Why? What is this about?
Any bit in particular? <+++++> Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it.
WillÂWhere is Mercutio? <+++++> Locked safe in here. I leave the scene in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a sonnet to write.
Yeah. Cool. <+++++> "The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
Yes. Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate - <+++++> But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
I don't have much time. <+++++> I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
Yeah. I think I want my money back. <+++++> What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now. <+++++> What'd it say?
The ones in the box of files. The box of files? The one from your office? <+++++> I didn't see any medical records in there.
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli. <+++++> But, you told me yourself...
So when are you authorized to use deadly force? <+++++> Well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot. But our customers need a little more than just that, you understand?
Do you like pink? <+++++> Very much.
He didn't know. Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way. He was very helpful. <+++++> In other words, the whole goddamn world knows you're here! Out! Get out!
Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do... <+++++> It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long.
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment. <+++++> Aye. You have a point there.
Man, this guy is really good. <+++++> He looks like my uncle.
 <+++++> -- Come on, you know F.C.O. regs.
Ah, Cats. Now and Forever. <+++++> Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.
Just take a look at this farmland before I come into Silverado. See what makes a trip this hard worth taking. I'll see you around. <+++++> I'll be around.
Don't touch me. Or so help me -- <+++++> What? What will you do? What CAN you do? There's nothing to be frightened of.
How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it? <+++++> No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
Thanks, though. Bye. <+++++> Dorothy. Ray. A pleasure.
Left jacket pocket? <+++++> Roger that.
No shit! That why they call him Ice? <+++++> Nope. It's the way he flies - Ice cold. No mistakes. Wears you down.
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us... The way they betrayed him... <+++++> I don't see it like that at all.
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings? <+++++> I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
I know. That's why I came back. <+++++> You scared?
I don't remember her as having brown eyes. <+++++> Benjamin?
What do you do? <+++++> I'm between jobs right now. My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.

Don't want to talk toÂdon't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody. <+++++> But it's King Westley on the phone.
Okay... let's say that, for now. <+++++> It's true, believe me.
-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time- <+++++> -oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life.
Excuse me, I need to explain... <+++++> Don't explain. Fuck off. Goodbye.
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome. <+++++> What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up. <+++++> What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
Is that what you used to do? <+++++> My days are not the old days, genius.
In the tar? ? <+++++> It was an accident, I'll get you a new one.
Fuck my life. Fuck fight club. Fuck you and fuck Marla. I'm sick of this. How's that? <+++++> Why do you think I blew up your condo?
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out. <+++++> Yes, sir.
You tried. <+++++> Don't you want to kill me?
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it? <+++++> Convene?
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb. <+++++> I'm glad Bill's back.
Yes. <+++++> Were any of them prettier than I am?
One spotters say you got two with that blast. <+++++> Two? Are you sure?
Ride like hell. Tonight we keep right on going. We'll walk the horses. <+++++> That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it! What the hell are those things?
And you are?... <+++++> Kate.
Is he gon' be gone long? <+++++> Might be...
What street? <+++++> What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive.
Mr. MacDougal. <+++++> You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it.
John -- <+++++> I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it. You've created a world without murder.
Aye sir, coding now. <+++++> Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind. <+++++> But they have to be warned, Sheriff. Jason will return to the area that's familiar.
What's his family background? <+++++> They're from out of state. Father's an engineer at the nuclear power plant. I really don't know much about them.
Don't tell me what to do! <+++++> Shhh!
Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden. <+++++> We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
Oh, yeah? What? <+++++> 
Maybe you went over the bridge. No guard rail there, it's easy to do. It's happened before. <+++++> It's possible. I just don't remember.
At a press conference. <+++++> What?
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight. <+++++> I just came out to say goodbye.
If you spent a little more time training them-- <+++++> Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
No we don't. <+++++> Well how long has this been going on.
I want you to head right home after school. <+++++> I will. Is that all?
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there! <+++++> It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one? <+++++> From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
About a minute...? <+++++> A little longer for me.
This it? <+++++> Yeah. Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.
Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more. <+++++> I guess you didn't kill nobody then.
That's the kid. <+++++> It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?
She seemed to take it pretty well. <+++++> Yeah, well, actually...
I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area... <+++++> I know a good probate lawyer.
Why? What happened? <+++++> Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio.
Please. <+++++> Shit!
Anybody talk to the press? <+++++> No, sir.
Don't! <+++++> Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
Nurse! <+++++> The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe. <+++++> ...I meant your food.
I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating? <+++++> Naturally.
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word. <+++++> I did it.
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousandÂand you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel! <+++++> Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
Are you sure? <+++++> Yes. Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
You do? <+++++> Everything else means nothing to me. If I hurt you again, I'll die.
Can you recommend a restaurant? <+++++> Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded... <+++++> So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne.
How's that? <+++++> Well done, James.
What do you think? <+++++> It's a rip and a hit.
Okay. <+++++> You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
I threw my back, again. <+++++> Aw, no lovin' tonight?
Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do? <+++++> Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
Yes. <+++++> You sound different. Is that really you?
That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex. <+++++> You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you. <+++++> Oh no. Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
The most respected ... <+++++> Whose side are you arguing ...? I thought that you wanted to do something.
And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me. <+++++> I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it "fits just perfect."
How do you know her hair's black? <+++++> Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it? <+++++> How about what?
This isn't a virus. It's a worm! <+++++> What's this one eat?
You're the Tribune man? <+++++> Yeah, hello. How are you?
These are <u>my</u> children. They don't want to <u>be</u> with you. <+++++> Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
I'll see to Pearl. <+++++> I'll make coffee.
You gotta have faith, Dad. <+++++> It's a little late for that.
The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything --- <+++++> I could take care of her.
No. I...listen, I can't make it in today. <+++++> You're kidding, right?
How serious? <+++++> It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
Did you kill my father? ! <+++++> No...! But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA. EX-CATCHER. America works.
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there! <+++++> No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
Do you know them? I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and -- <+++++> I've got to get back to the --
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time. <+++++> She's a jerk.
Oh...that's okay. <+++++> When you do...
Mitchell was too drunk. <+++++> Or just drunk enough. He was with her when she registered. He knew where her room was. You were out most of the evening.
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School. <+++++> I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail! <+++++> Aye, aye, sir!
Eh?... Oh. <+++++> He works the boats as a "come-on" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business.
Korda escaped. <+++++> And you think he'll...
Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it. <+++++> Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
Very nice. <+++++> It's focus. Every opponent has a weak spot. You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
What is it? <+++++> You better get down here.
Oh. <+++++> I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something. I guess you really miss her, huh?
But what? <+++++> I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you? <+++++> What do you mean?
This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again! <+++++> Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
I don't really feel like talking anymore. <+++++> Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
I sure hate to go alone... <+++++> I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
I know. But chances are... <+++++> Chances are there's still a chance.
Jack, you're wrong. <+++++> Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
It's just five minutes. She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves. <+++++> Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
Sheila... Stop... <+++++> FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU! !
Yup. <+++++> Oh my God. Oh my God.
Consigned to flames of woe. <+++++> Do you believe in it?
What were you gonna say? Go ahead. <+++++> I don't -
I'm your Psychiatrist. <+++++> Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
You're a good friend. <+++++> You too, sweetie, the best.
I'm her father! <+++++> With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
I don't know who that is. <+++++> What's going on in Berlin?
Because you're coming home. <+++++> Why don't you just take me back without it?
-- and I'll get 'em. <+++++> You'll always be my hero, Jerry. Always always always.
Hey, you know what I really think? <+++++> Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South. <+++++> Why do people think I'm you?
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight. <+++++> Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried. <+++++> No. Life is too short.
Hey. <+++++> Hey.
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison? This looks like Sheila's. <+++++> It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
I knew it! I told you it was a fake. <+++++> That New-York-Italian-Father- made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch. What was our bet? A million?
What happened on June 17 I don't think the President knew anything about. Some of his men I'm not so sure of. <+++++> Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
That may be. But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here! <+++++> You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
You're from Muncie? ! <+++++> Why yes, do you know it?
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before. <+++++> It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
So... we understand each other Judge? <+++++> Yeah.
I got rid of him. I wanted to see if... I wanted to be the only one. I wanted to be Snow. <+++++> Fuck me. I knew it.
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing. <+++++> Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever. <+++++> Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
Seriously, I think we should get married. <+++++> We been through this before--
But he's never there. <+++++> Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
What? <+++++> And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
Never. <+++++> I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this. Oh, boy...
Right. <+++++> T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from.
Walked. <+++++> You walked. What the hell are you doing here.
 <+++++> Let's take another call. London, England, you're on "Tru Talk."
His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman. <+++++> Boy.
Granted. <+++++> My colors?
You do know me. You helped me once. <+++++> That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles. See, he definitely doesn't know me.
Oh. Yeah. <+++++> You've been coming in early.
OK, I'm fine. <+++++> Good.
The heart pumps it. <+++++> Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
Mm-hmm. Seems & lot longer. <+++++> In the bayou, they have a saying... 'You choose the music for the dance - but fortune picks your partner.'
I don't think you're gonna need it. <+++++> Well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.
Feds are looking for him, too. Real nice business he's got, huh? <+++++> What's that?
I am listening, my son. <+++++> Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men. And I betrayed you.
In the attic. <+++++> Show me.
Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon. <+++++> But all he had was chocolate milk.
Well, it is. It is that, too. <+++++> That's a big comfort to me.
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you? <+++++> Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
That night in the fire while my daddy was dyin'... I saw mama up in her room with Santos... <+++++> ...They was laughin' arm in arm like animals.
No, Chinese food is fine. <+++++> Saturday night's the 'Springtime in Paris' dance. I'm taking Suzy Parker.
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable. <+++++> Sad commentary, huh?
Frank! <+++++> Stay here. That was my son!
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know? <+++++> I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file.
Who the hell is Jimmy? <+++++> He's the only one I told.
That's a lie! ! <+++++> I never saw him before!
Yeah... How do you know it? <+++++> ...I heard he said... That's all... Thanks.
Maybe they have to pee. <+++++> Are you kidding? He might as well say, "Can I date rape you?"
Find them. <+++++> But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
You bet we is! <+++++> I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them. <+++++> Are they nice?
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta. And... <+++++> I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today. Could we interest you in someone else?
When was this? <+++++> I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered... <+++++> I don't even bother with guests registering any more... I mean, little by little, you drop the formalities.
I need her exact name, you see. <+++++> That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there.
Is that your driver? <+++++> It's stupid.
Either you'll be shot with bullets, impaled with a large spike, or nailed like a super model. Basically you're fucked any way you go. <+++++> And that's different than this because...... ?
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you -- <+++++> Stay out of it, Carter. You're going back to L.A.
Wadda you so sore about? <+++++> Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts. <+++++> Grandma?
How much you playin' for? <+++++> A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
I hate that thing. <+++++> Keeps fairies away!
But the NLF has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ... <+++++> And you believe the NLF?
"The Voiiiiices made him do it." <+++++> The Witch's voice.
Asking the wrong person again. <+++++> I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --
Yes. <+++++> We move. Place to place.
I've still kind of got a thing for him. That's what you wanted to know, isn't it? <+++++> Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
Victor, I'm sorry I -- <+++++> Just find him.
You idiot. You almost gave me a massive coronary. <+++++> I didn't mean to scare you like that.
What is that? What are you doing with your hands? Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila. <+++++> Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
How's egghead? <+++++> Like a baby. You?
Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon. <+++++> Yeah, wall, you know, I was just going there... to pick then up.
It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess. <+++++> Tell me all about her.
That's Lily. Your mother, rest her soul. <+++++> Mother. She's beautiful.
Good luck. <+++++> Thanks.
Tell me about it, please! <+++++> 
This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me. <+++++> I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed. <+++++> The bet's off.
Cookie didn't draw it. I did. <+++++> You drew this? !
Nice car. How much did you pay for it? <+++++> Too much. Eighteen hundred.
You better pray, gal. You better pray... <+++++> Don't you lay a CURSE ON ME!
Get away from her. <+++++> Excuse --
What was that, Doolittle? <+++++> Negative effect.
I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him. <+++++> That's a terrific idea.
And failed. These doors are solid steel. <+++++> This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
...the finest people you could ever hope to work with...  You have the new Old Mill pages? <+++++> I can't find the writer.
Amy, just listen. Take Cindy and get out of the house. Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there... <+++++> What's wrong? Are you alright?
Now, now. He's a good boy. <+++++> Shit. We don't know what he is.
No. <+++++> Then what was good about it?
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking. <+++++> Yes, it's coming along very well.
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding. <+++++> Exactly. A dance.
Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile. <+++++> Caution shows wisdom.
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him... <+++++> I can't guarantee that...
Don't you have to be at the office? <+++++> Is there any more rice...?
Is this becoming complicated? <+++++> I'm not sure that I care anymore.
I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out. <+++++> But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help.
You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor. <+++++> I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her. <+++++> It's a very moving experience, trust me.
... the good of the few... <+++++> Or the one.
Walter-- <+++++> YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO! !
You comin' in to hold my hand? <+++++> No...
Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be. Maybe itÂs there with... <+++++> ItÂs not.
God dammit, Stifler! <+++++> Check-out time! Please vacate the room.
Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed. <+++++> Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
How did you know? <+++++> You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you... <+++++> You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth? !
If they don't tell me what I need to know... <+++++> Doesn't it get... Tiring?
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much... <+++++> Right. Who called?
What? <+++++> I'm not telling 'til you straighten up.
Uh, we didn't score yet. <+++++> Sorry to hear that. Me, I took a beating.
She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph. <+++++> Of course. I wish everything were that easy.
No. <+++++> They do, my brother.
I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please. <+++++> Nan, I --
"The Angel of Flight 104!" You're telling me you're the A...? <+++++> "Angel!" I didn't say "angel," that's a little strong.
Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place? Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff? <+++++> Yup.
Three days. <+++++> To...you know.
He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born. <+++++> Does he have the spot?
You made out alright. <+++++> Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be there when I arrived...
My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off. These will be open. <+++++> Wouldn't they normally be locked?
Well, good night, Louis. <+++++> Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
How did you get here? <+++++> We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
From someone who didn't want to have a baby. <+++++> Like you?
But the cuts are not equal. Some, like you and he, have more. Much more. <+++++> And you?
Hey, Brad... how's it going? <+++++> Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
It's outta here! <+++++> Come on man. Let's just talk about it.
Show me. <+++++> Here?
Yeah what? ! <+++++> Derek Mantini!
How long after that was the paralysis complete? <+++++> Nearly a year.
Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper. I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density. <+++++> Thanks.
I can drop them on my way to...  That's funny....  Where are those bonds? <+++++> Bonds, sir?
Tell me. <+++++> I didn't really think anything of it.
No --- how does it go? <+++++> Now cut that out, girls-none of that rough talk. They went to a conservatory.
I suppose. It's very expensive. <+++++> It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
No. <+++++> Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
You, a lady of title! <+++++> I'm staying, Jean.
What are you doing? <+++++> This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother.
It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire... <+++++> How nice.
You didn't cook breakfast? <+++++> Did it yesterday. Franks and beans.
Why would he do that? <+++++> To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
What happened between you and the blonde? <+++++> What?
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness. <+++++> Go away. Let me rot?
There's a big black spider in the bathroom. <+++++> That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then. <+++++> It is the time.
I see. Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other. <+++++> I guess not.
Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job. <+++++> Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
Well? <+++++> Well, we should identify ourselves.
Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial! <+++++> Let us go, miss.
All right, then. <+++++> The bitch.
What'd you have? <+++++> I had a... salad.
It used to be the Old Mill. <+++++> What've you got?
You got some kind of list? <+++++> Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
Something bad happened here, Murphy. <+++++> That much I think we've already established.
He didn't recognize me. <+++++> It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
Oh, a little. But it's not just physical loneliness. It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you. <+++++> I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.
It turned out to be cancer. <+++++> Wow.
Cause you're my baby and I love you. <+++++> What am I going to do with you?
Well... yes, sir, there are. <+++++> These are for my sister... her birthday you see.
While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything? <+++++> Shit! Shit!
All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again. <+++++> You waved to me in the elevator.
Shush, Adele. <+++++> Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be. <+++++> No.
I ain't got nothing but them books. <+++++> You better go get 'em.
Sharks have to keep moving. They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die. <+++++> Is there such a place? A cave or something with such a flow?
England? <+++++> Oh hell.
This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty! <+++++> You're wrong, George.
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur. <+++++> He was the last baby my father delivered, Arthur was.
That makes it worse. <+++++> But I don't understand.
We have an arrangement now. <+++++> What side of the industry did you say you were on?
He didn't say anything? <+++++> Yeah, he was gonna check out "things that go bump in the night."
He musta blew up. I got the hell outta there. I didn't have the nerve to face the kid. <+++++> A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
Okay. <+++++> I'll see you back at the hotel.
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem? <+++++> Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy". <+++++> Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
I'd better be getting back. Bye, love. <+++++> pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
Oh. <+++++> Why don't I--?
Okay, sucker. <+++++> Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!
No-no-no... <+++++> I had lunch with Karen not three hours ago.
I don't suppose I could watch. <+++++> Might be exciting for you.
Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter. <+++++> Do you know it like that? By heart.
He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something! <+++++> Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
We should do it. <+++++> No-I can't take the time off work.
Drop it. <+++++> For now.
Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software! <+++++> Burn!
I don't know how to thank you. <+++++> I enjoyed every minute of it.
What's it to you? ! <+++++> I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Didn't I ever tell you about Phantom Mary? <+++++> No.
What's the point of this? <+++++> Does everything have to have a point?
Me first. <+++++> Huh huh. No way, dude.
I feel the ribbon. <+++++> Then you must get it.
Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort. <+++++> Yes, I will.
Having two pints in the Rock. <+++++> Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
What? <+++++> No one else knows
So she hasn't changed? <+++++> That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
What happened? <+++++> The guidance system's fried. I had to switch to manual. -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
Well, I never had to do it before. <+++++> You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.

Nine seconds. <+++++> Eleven and a half.

Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy. <+++++> Stacy, he's not a guy. He's a little prick!
Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it. These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school... <+++++> That's not right, really, cuz I...
You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous! <+++++> Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
What do you, what do you do? Carry a kilo around in your purse? <+++++> This crowd wouldn't know the difference! They're embalmed!

You went behind my back and you cut me out. <+++++> No, I never. I would not do that, George. Never.
The what? <+++++> The chromium. Well, that's what kicked this whole thing off.

What the hell are those things? How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon? <+++++> <u>Why</u> would they do it?
And PERFECT. CUT! <+++++> "Perfect"? Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production? !
Yes, madame? <+++++> What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night? <+++++> Did you?
I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet. <+++++> Is that what you think?
Flowers incorporate a beauty that I always missed in life. But certainly, you're not here to chat about my hobbies. <+++++> 1976. What happened back then?
It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car. <+++++> No. You gonna stay close to me from now on. So you don't disappear on me.
I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long... <+++++> Not long.
That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged. <+++++> That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her. She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain. <+++++> As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties.

Whatcha got left ... ? <+++++> "Carol." A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ...
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me. <+++++> She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war. <+++++> A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.
You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all. <+++++> Stupid.
Stensland and Meeks. What were they up to? <+++++> Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.

Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty? <+++++> You see someone?

I didn't think I wanted to. <+++++> Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money. <+++++> I think she's pretty, Mommy.
Bob Larson. Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen? <+++++> A violation?
I'll talk to you tomorrow. <+++++> That's what you said before.

Way out. I'm acting correctly here. Not you. Not your gung-ho jungle ace. It's over. Walk away. <+++++> It's not over. You made one mistake.
Um, yes. I haven't fought with them, since I started here. <+++++> Goals are important.
Business to finish. Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara. I might be able to pick up some work there. <+++++> You just travel around, no direction, no steady work. You must like taking chances.
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin. <+++++> Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
Why are you here? <+++++> I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
Can't tell yet. Where'd you go? <+++++> That smell's still fillin' this room good.
I think I would like that drink. I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine. <+++++> At breakfast.
What are you doing in here? <+++++> Having a nervous breakdown.
The poet...something he said... <+++++> Yes?

Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses -- <+++++> -- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.

Please take it. <+++++> Well...
Not "we", Sidney, you! <+++++> Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.
You fellers'll have to figure it out. You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot. <+++++> I'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning.
Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself. <+++++> I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?
Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You live in 605? <+++++> Yeah.
Father, I wasn't disputing you. <+++++> When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please. Until then, you will listen to me.
Toys for... adults? <+++++> C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
Elektra King? Are you insane? This is her pipeline. <+++++> Makes her look even more innocent.
You knew...? <+++++> It went away....
One. <+++++> Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
That's good. That's really good. You have a gift for words. <+++++> It's in your play.
Without peer? <+++++> I -- uh, yeah, I guess, yeah.
Mrs. Dudley. <+++++> So far.
How do you define it? <+++++> I don't.
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath? <+++++> How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad?
Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy. <+++++> Take it off! Take it off! ...S'il vous plait?...
Most of these people don't even know where they are, they're not gonna hurt you. <+++++> In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
Goodbye... <+++++> Goodbye.
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore? <+++++> No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
Don't go. I'm frightened. I can love a coward, I can't love another dead man. <+++++> This is what I do. I do this every day.
What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn. <+++++> Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered.
How do you know him? <+++++> I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.

Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there? <+++++> Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me Â always! <+++++> Who is she?
Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps. <+++++> I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
Hi. <+++++> I've changed my mind. I'll come to Moscow. If you -- are still going --
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't... <+++++> I know, I know. Who can think of worms when your libido's in full swing, right?
He did? <+++++> One of your people told me.

But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me-- <+++++> Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
I think I just got my period. <+++++> Does that mean this whole thing is over?
 <+++++> Have they nothing to fear presently?
 <+++++> You know I'd tell you if I had it.
Two days. <+++++> And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...
Will you come with me, please. <+++++> Hold the fort down, will ya, fellas!
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me. <+++++> Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.

Well... here. <+++++> In my apartment?

I mean drugs. I thought you said he was? <+++++> He wouldn't use around me. I don't like any of it.
All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had. <+++++> Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
Minh... <+++++> Yep...
Run, Daniel! Get out of here! <+++++> I'm not leaving without you, Susan!
He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about! <+++++> Like what?
I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there. <+++++> 'Been up north?
What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons. You gotta give her what she's never had. <+++++> What?
I recommend it. <+++++> Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible. <+++++> All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller. <+++++> What's it to ya?
What do you think? <+++++> Lines up with the map and the photos.

The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens. <+++++> How do you survive?
Zeke. <+++++> What? Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."

Maybe we should've tried to hop it. <+++++> It was going too fast.
Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that. <+++++> Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.
Turn her over to a stalker. <+++++> What?! You're calling me a stalker?
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck. <+++++> So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
I'm sorry. <+++++> Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies. Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out? <+++++> She never will. That is my job. It has been for a long time. You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.
No? Then what? <+++++> I just want to see you as much as I can!
Do you know what you're going to do? <+++++> No.
He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop... <+++++> He was a scumbag!... He wanted <u>me</u>, Bobby. These guys don't let go!

Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions. <+++++> Well, yeah... OK, but you're not listening to me. There are other things that need to be taken into account here.
When were you going to tell me you were not going with us? <+++++> I still have work to do here.
How do you know this shit? <+++++> They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something.
That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know? <+++++> Do you miss it? You seem like you do.
I mean, you broke up with me, right? <+++++> Are you kidding?
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone? <+++++> I didn't say when I want to die -
Yeah. <+++++> Oh, yeah, really? Really? How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy?
I heard that. <+++++> Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process. <+++++> Look -- those are the first metals that came through.
Your... lover? <+++++> Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.

He asked where you were! He wants you with him. <+++++> I don't wanna go.
Mama is keeping score. Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me <+++++> I'm not surprised.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so. <+++++> That'd be something.
Hey, shut up will ya? <+++++> It was a bad dream...
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else. <+++++> It's too late for that.
To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to. <+++++> Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"
The internal monitors read normal. <+++++> Where's Doc? !
Want a beer? Is Pony coming? <+++++> No, thanks. I don't drink. Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did she talk to him?
You don't believe in the Force? <+++++> Sorcery! I believe in myself... I determine my destiny, not some mystical energy field.
Ah -- <+++++> Dorothy next!
She married some English prick. <+++++> He's not that bad of a guy ..?
He's not a loser at all! <+++++> Oh, he's such a loser!
Did the driver really freeze? <+++++> Like a popsicle. They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
He had a pressing engagement. <+++++> Philistine.
Done. <+++++> Holy shit.
Well... What   is   it? <+++++> Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir!
Right. <+++++> It's not your concern. It's... business, that's all.
Where was this? <+++++> At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
Do you know where she is? <+++++> She's out.
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black -- <+++++> -- what? --
You must have been concerned. <+++++> It's happened before. I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it.
Quit? She wants to quit? <+++++> Listen, Gale, I know you're emotionally involved. Don't be emotionally involved, be professional.
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London. <+++++> Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
You didn't hire me. She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her. <+++++> She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain. Enough churning over the past. She wants it all left alone.
You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are. <+++++> Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay?
Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton? <+++++> They were left over from the last shift.
It's getting pretty late. We better go. <+++++> Yeah...
We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well. <+++++> That's not true. I never met anybody named Oswald. Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
Have you tried to ask the God for anything? <+++++> Well... no...
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified. <+++++> I know that.
It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature. <+++++> Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season.
You mean it's dangerous? <+++++> Nah, not dangerous. Not that dangerous. Not during the day.
Maybe we can just watch some TV. <+++++> There's a TV in the basement.
Hi. <+++++> Hello.
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand? <+++++> No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality.
Oh yeah? <+++++> Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me.
God, she's beautiful. <+++++> Victoria? She's okay.

I don't see why not. <+++++> But what if---it wasn't real?
But if she dies... <+++++> It's only mortal death.
I thought they'd talk to him. Try to get him to dummy up. <+++++> Maybe he gave them an argument.
Yes? <+++++> I need to see you, at once. Girls, please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments. Mary Clarence?
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling... <+++++> What?
Open it up. <+++++> Here...
I don't know. <+++++> They told me Becker's in Shelbourne now. I looked him up and he was listed.
Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going. <+++++> You're wasting your time, already been tried.
We've got some margarine too if you'd like to scoop it out of the tub. <+++++> No, I'm fine thanks.
What can he do, he's clean... <+++++> Gimme the black guy...
-- Don't tell me where you're going. <+++++> I won't.
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you? <+++++> It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now? <+++++> Assailing my fragile sense of security, that's what.
Almost as if it were being written especially for us. <+++++> No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
I'm tired. I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance. <+++++> Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay? Be right back.
We used to take baths together. <+++++> Come on. Let's go.
Yes...fine. <+++++> And Zoe? How's Zoe?
Hey. You remember that nut in the hockey mask? With the asthma? What was his name . . . <+++++> Oh yeah. The one that used to confess to everything? Hoping we'd beat him up?
I got him on the knee! <+++++> You missed him!
I don't have a lot to say, Michael. <+++++> We have time.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one. <+++++> I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
I'd be gentle as a lizard -- <+++++> I'd be clever as a gizzard --
She comes in the daytime. She still with me, my Denver. <+++++> You got to get up from here, girl.
Caesar, this is crazy. <+++++> Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. Maybe you dropped the Scotch by accident. Maybe you didn't.
Like a psychiatrist? <+++++> 
Okay. <+++++> Don't do anything stupid.
Some social democrats. Some diligent anti-communists. A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA. <+++++> Nonsense.
Screw off. <+++++> How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
She's been talking about this little editing machine, it's only... <+++++> 
What's that mean? <+++++> I've managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and assorted minions, who will contact my father.
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- ! <+++++> It's only for an hour --
I don't know her. <+++++> Take her picture. C'mere.
Your father has business. <+++++> Why today? And why'd she have to go with him?
I already did. This morning. When you went running. <+++++> Oh. You didn't tell me.
All right, then how about this? <+++++> Hey, you're gonna piss me--  What the hell are you supposed to be...
Attractive... <+++++> Don't ask.
I'm serious here. <+++++> So am I.
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you? <+++++> I have to.
Holy shit. <+++++> Lemme see the map.
Not tomorrow, either. You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away. <+++++> Where to? South America? Oh. That is unexpected.
You come way out here to get into more trouble. You could've stayed at home. <+++++> Willie, shut up. Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
This is Samir. See if you can guess his specialty. <+++++> Oral hygiene?
About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims. <+++++> There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
That was my CD. Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD. <+++++> Did you see the way those girls drove off? I did you a favor.
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank. <+++++> I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.
Maybe. I should call Ben. <+++++> Then it could all come out, sooner or later. Nobody should be in on this. Just you and me. Or, more correctly, I.
What? <+++++> I want to buy a car.
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises. <+++++> There's always a surprise.
Oh good. <+++++> You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
Paris?!? What are you doing here? <+++++> Is that any way to say hello?
I'm John Corrigan. I'm an assistant district attorney, Ms.  Tramell. Can we get you anything? Would you like some coffee? <+++++> No thank you.
I don't believe you. <+++++> Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
What you been doing? <+++++> Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
I could think of better places to meet her, instead of here. He lives on the whole top floor. <+++++> I doubt that it matters any more.
Grandma Death. <+++++> That is a terrible nickname.
Shut up! Both of you right now! <+++++> Shhhh! Roach, shut the fuck up.
You're Death's <u>brother</u>? <+++++> Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My- Way-or-the-Highway Death.
'See ya. <+++++> 'Bye, Jocko.
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee. <+++++> Fuck you.
No, I mean... you love your son? <+++++> More than anything in the world.
Not always. But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me. <+++++> I didn't do anything. It just happened.
Fine, Dennis. Soon as I get my money for this week. <+++++> I'll be right with you.
Look. New videocameras. Color viewfinder. Image stabilization. Solarization. Night vision. <+++++> We have no money. Come on.
Nothing. <+++++> Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
Tough break. <+++++> Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we?
What usually eats a banana? <+++++> A monkey?
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita. <+++++> Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
Benjamin, is this your first time? <+++++> Is this -- what?
What's this? <+++++> That's a lucky C note for our new deal.
Right. You're right. <+++++> Damn right I'm right.
Why not...? <+++++> No one's ever asked me that before.
By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime. <+++++> Easy Micheal.
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded... <+++++> I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone.
Is smoking fun? <+++++> Oh, I suppose so.
Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship. <+++++> I know but Mom doesn't. Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out. Dinner, maybe.
When's your show? <+++++> Not sure. How was yours?
I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that? <+++++> This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find Âem.
Yea, of course. Now where could they have put it? On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here. <+++++> What's on Thursdays?
No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you. <+++++> Oh--yikes!
That's really what I came here for. See what you guys recommend. <+++++> Well, I'm sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces.
I'll tuck you in. <+++++> You can't seduce me.
Sorry - <+++++> Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
Every entry was authorized. <+++++> Keep looking.
When is that? <+++++> I'll call you.
Well that's something. <+++++> What is.
What's your relationship? <+++++> She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach.
This is some crazy shit, man! <+++++> Those cocksuckers sold me out!
You're talking through your hat now. <+++++> Not at all. I was in the foxholes myself.
Yeah... <+++++> Gotta go. See you guys later.
She got all right? <+++++> ...after a while.
Merrill -- <+++++> I'm looking!
You could do it. <+++++> Get out of here....
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night. <+++++> You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
Dante, let me grab a Gatorade. <+++++> If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
Yep. <+++++> Don't do it. Don't aim at the head.
IÂm having kind of a bad day. <+++++> I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
Yeah? <+++++> I think we need to eat.
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days. <+++++> Do it.
It's niiice. <+++++> Beautiful thing, alimony. Lose a husband, get a car. Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
The guy was history when he killed Kelly. You knew that. <+++++> But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting-- <+++++> I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
I don't want to know -- <+++++> My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
Your door was unlocked. <+++++> Still is, so let yourself out.
Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy. <+++++> He'll kill you, Lenny.
What's the problem? <+++++> You think I have a problem?
Hello? <+++++> Are you alone in the house?
Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor? <+++++> I have to talk to her.
What do you mean? <+++++> I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
Aren't you coming? <+++++> No, I'm not much of a dancer.
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth? <+++++> Same reason I put explosives around the habitat. For defense. For the power. To protect myself.
Can we get through these? <+++++> Sure but what good will that do?
Then you've read it? <+++++> Not yet.
Huh? <+++++> Yes, I know about it. And I know that you acted as courier.
Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around? <+++++> Were you supposed to have a session?
I drink. <+++++> And when you drink, you get drunk.
Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke. <+++++> Must he go?
What time is it? <+++++> Eight-thirty.
Are you fucking high again? Just listen to -- <+++++> No, no, you're right, Fry. What's to be afraid of? My life is a steamin' pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow.
One of these days me ship's comin' in from Ireland,  God love 'er, loaded to the gunnels with sweet Irish whiskey! <+++++> Nolan, me lad, ye're dreamin' again.
I thought you'd be up with the sun. <+++++> My stupid back.
What about her? <+++++> Get something going there.
Sing. <+++++> It is a beautiful day. I am merely enjoying it.
And why is that? <+++++> Because they're all the same.
Yeah, I'll do you a favour. <+++++> Could you please put my glass on the table?
I always am. <+++++> Don't get hurt.
What about you Max? <+++++> What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon. <+++++> Okay.
For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here. <+++++> I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am.
He killed a police officer. <+++++> Your plane's at nine a.m.  Be on it. That's orders. Period.
Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs? <+++++> Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
Just a humble perk from my Dad's Construction company or should I say Deconstruction company? <+++++> I don't know. Should you?
...You are ze fahzer? <+++++> No. Uh... family friend.
So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway? <+++++> I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
I don't let anybody call me that. <+++++> You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
Coffey, we're a little pressed for time. <+++++> Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature. <+++++> That's right. It's how the species survives. You'll never convince me otherwise. Wanna dance?
Twenty bucks. <+++++> All right, asshole, you're on.
They were all wrong. They couldn't control him. <+++++> And what happend to ...?
It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail. <+++++> No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean?
I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere. <+++++> Well you've gotta be prepared.
It's none of my business anymore. <+++++> I thought you might want to be filled in.
I know! I-I-I-I, I realize. <+++++> What do you expect me to say?
Believe me, I know your feelings on the matter. <+++++> The receptionist said you called earlier about something.
You can't -- <+++++> The hell I can't. It's my cab. I don't like you. So, get the hell out!
And I'd end up a widow in two ways. Let's forget it. I'll just be a little more careful next time. <+++++> There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here.
I found a lid. It was laying on the ground over there. <+++++> Put that down. It's dirty.
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes. <+++++> Good plan that.
It's obviously based on Elliot and me. <+++++> Oh, so loosely.
They're still running with shields down. <+++++> Of course. We're one big happy fleet.
Max? You men we're having company again? <+++++> 'Again'? Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
That way. <+++++> And so it is. I'll talk to you later.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more? <+++++> I owe you. since I goofed up this one.
They tell me you're an American agent. <+++++> What are you talking about?
What do you say we send a bottle over? <+++++> I don't believe it. You're a romantic, Frank.
Yes, Miss Ratched? <+++++> Please see to Mister Bromden.
How are you feeling? <+++++> Confused. I'm not sure what to do now. I'm not sure what he wants for me.
These guys are trained to be ghosts. <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake! <+++++> So what do you suggest?
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth. Take my advice and make that bet. <+++++> Oh, shit. Take your time! Don't get suckered! This man is a murderer! In his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators.
That's it. <+++++> Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
Would you like some brandy? <+++++> Thank you.
Caesar? <+++++> That this illness has clouded his mind.
Pull over. <+++++> Where? Why?
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it. <+++++> I don't believe it.
You capitalist pig! <+++++> 
you crave what I might show you. What you can learn. What I can give you. So much more than Michael can. <+++++> What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
Get back! ! <+++++> The generator!
Cool. Is there a menu? Or buffet? <+++++> Before we do, you might like to freshen up. And you'll certainly want to change
I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was. <+++++> Guess where I am?
Bullseye! <+++++> Stop the car! Now! !
Orders. <+++++> To kill me?
About that chest-cutter... <+++++> I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
You used to love it when I called you doll. <+++++> You said it differently then.
He needs me to get out of his world into ours...He's gonna take me again. <+++++> No, Jesse. This isn't happening.
Transfer me, suspend me. Just leave me alone. <+++++> You make a mistake?
We're going right ahead with--*what*? <+++++> Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do? <+++++> You are saying goodbye, aren't you...?
A cop... <+++++> I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now. <+++++> You can if you want.
Frank. <+++++> I knew you'd come.
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...? <+++++> Yes.
No thanks. <+++++> Lots of girls. The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning. <+++++> But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
You want -- <+++++> Not you. I want Ricky to answer.
-- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear -- <+++++> Lester, don't you think that uhh --
What? <+++++> I know where your heart truly lies.
... Maybe I'll watch it on TV. <+++++> "We"? You and...
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it! <+++++> Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
Isn't there something you want to tell me? <+++++> To tell you?
Say it again. <+++++> I'd do anything for you, Dil.
I know, Dad. <+++++> I know I'm not the best... communicator.
Aaron, I've never seen them like this -- I think Paul's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to... <+++++> Wait. Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
Thanks for the ride. <+++++> They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
What are you, God? <+++++> Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you? <+++++> Well, I --
I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap. <+++++> The car for Debbie?
Please let me try. I'm begging you. <+++++> And I am refusing. As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.
If you're wondering about the firearm. <+++++> Yes.
What? <+++++> Never mind. Let's get right to the heart of this thing. Twenty-four hours ago we were sitting in the Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills Hotel...
Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order. <+++++> Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
Uh-huh. <+++++> Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
That's Father at work, What'll I do? Peter, what'll I do? <+++++> Don't look at me. I didn't marry King Westley.
No, not really. <+++++> But you do therapy?
The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia... <+++++> You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
I'm still second best. <+++++> You ever fly an F-14?
I know. <+++++> Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
You got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape... <+++++> Why would he send this to Helen Hudson...
Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward! <+++++> You're right -- I am a coward.
See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen... <+++++> ...I can't even see it...
The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but - <+++++> Then have the lab check Raspail's head. Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
Just like going swimming, isn't it? <+++++> Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through. I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
Just kiss me. It would mean such a lot to me. <+++++> Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
What are you going you doing? <+++++> Are you scared?
What do you mean tip the cops? Is the man a lunatic or what? <+++++> Will you relax? This in no way affects our business. Go on.
Sure. <+++++> Just like we look forward to this.
Jackie, what're you doing? <+++++> Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
You called the doctor, huh? <+++++> Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
Chicken blood on the crops. <+++++> ...Chicken blood? Who said it was... "chicken blood"?
What's that? <+++++> Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps.
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you? <+++++> I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess.
We miss you. We miss our son. <+++++> We miss our family.
Boy. I had a feeling today was going to be the day... Helicopter. <+++++> Yeah.
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina. <+++++> Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked. <+++++> This is different. This is important. How many? !
How's that again? <+++++> No key!
Or perhaps they're on the surface. <+++++> Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
The Stratford. <+++++> Nice place. Fulla velvet. Even the bedspreads. Damn! Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks.
Hey, I'm learning as I go. <+++++> So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency. <+++++> Why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood?
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law. <+++++> Beer? Well, all right.
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two? <+++++> No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
What is wrong with you? What? You're going away. You're getting help somewhere. <+++++> You can't make me.
Sometimes a wound will kill. <+++++> Now you tell us.
Fine. He's got a plan <+++++> And you're going to lead us.
You're kind of being a butt-head right now. <+++++> How do you figure?
By the way, how's he doing? <+++++> He's dead.
Exactly what information led you to arrest my client just two-and-a-half hours after the shooting took place? <+++++> We had a description of the suspect.
You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done? <+++++> I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
"But new struck nine." <+++++> "Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?"
...it isn't you...? Who is it? Who is this I'm talking to? I need the leads... <+++++> ...after the thirtieth...
Why? <+++++> Because she killed herself! !
This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right? The rest of this is all .30 caliber-- <+++++> They were using M-1's, yeah--
In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way. <+++++> No.
What do you mean 'We...?' <+++++> It's my charter. My party.
It could be. <+++++> I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
No. <+++++> Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords. <+++++> I'm not fucking him..
We don't get a gig. <+++++> What're you talking about?
You won't like it. <+++++> Just ask it!
Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday. <+++++> I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files.
Which one are you? <+++++> Whitefoot, of course.
I have a problem. <+++++> Ah.
Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming... <+++++> Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
Report! <+++++> Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
It's better than shovelling horse shit. <+++++> If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
How can I give you this statement? <+++++> We'll lower a basket from the window ...
No. No, you don't understand. We're not selling it. It came from here. We want ... <+++++> Everything sold as is. No guarantees. No returns.
You have to shave? Like an ape? <+++++> Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
Yes? <+++++> Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
Hey big shot, get off your ass. They need a potted palm over in the Carl Laemmle Building. <+++++> Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz.
Too damn dangerous. <+++++> ... You think this Thing wants to become an animal? Dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea.
Oh, man. <+++++> There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person. It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean?
You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us. <+++++> You're talking about taking a life. The most unique life form on this planet. I think we're better than that.
Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast. <+++++> No... what about your sister?
Oh, it's so soft. <+++++> It's nice isn't it?
Yes, you do. <+++++> And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards! !
It's fine. It was fun, though. <+++++> It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
- back to  Nigeria. Yeah. <+++++> Listen...
What's going on? <+++++> I think we're going to exit the space port.
You getting into bed to think about yellow? <+++++> I likes yellow.
More denunciations? <+++++> One Senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes.
Of the separate chemicals--I don't know, uh, offhand-- <+++++> How much of this shit do they have, White! !
This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs...? <+++++> Rose Calvert.
May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour. <+++++> Who said I was going?
A headache? <+++++> I did a routine once-over, and gave him a sleeping pill. I've never seen this man before. Neither have the guards.
"A habituÃ¨ of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years." <+++++> Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible! Well. Go on.
To avoid killing anyone. <+++++> Are you saying that if you had not been carrying your banner you'd have killed more people?
That's ridiculous. <+++++> And you've got cold feet.
Yes, sir. I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican? <+++++> Yes, I am.
What are you doing here, where've you been? <+++++> I have a new client.
Because his mother got sick - very sick. He couldn't leave her. He's a kind boy, maybe too kind. <+++++> I can't believe he married Meryl on the rebound.
He's certainly good-natured. <+++++> "Smooth's" the word.
Listen, I was thinking, you know. Would you go, it's I think you're... <+++++> Do you want to go out with me ?
Maybe she wants to make peace with the past. <+++++> What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.
Yes. <+++++> Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response? Plus fluctuation of the pupil, plus involuntary dilation of the iris?
It's possible. I don't know about that. <+++++> I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
I felt he did not like me. <+++++> That should decide it or you --
You lost Ben? ! <+++++> Of course not. Does he look lost to you? BENNNNN!! !
Negroes would be in an uproar. <+++++> So what. We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that. No such thing as bad publicity. So what.
Like...? <+++++> Gina in the Miami pad. You gonna give me phony denials?
No. <+++++> You don't get rich as a cook, either, believe me. I got a girl going to college this fall.
I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me. <+++++> Join up with you!
I'll take that as a compliment. In the city, what kind of place do you live in? <+++++> I have a loft.
On whose orders? <+++++> General McAddie's.
Look at all that silverware. <+++++> Trophies. You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
Now defendant's father had also died by that point. Where was the defendant? When you sent his family their equity. <+++++> In the war. Europe, I believe. They could hardly send him to the Pacific, could they?
I'm pretty nervous. Are you? <+++++> Yes.
It is insane. <+++++> It's the only way, Bud. Now trust me.
Give her what she wants, room, food, anything. Charge it all. Don't you put her out, Paul. <+++++> I would never do that.
No, I want my cut! <+++++> I'm going to say this one last time for you, so take a deep breath and count to ten. There is no cut.
Well, we won't. <+++++> C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
You going to eat this? <+++++> What did your <u>boyfriend</u> say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?
What's the matter?...Grace? <+++++> Nothing.
My favorite doctor. What's the verdict? <+++++> Under the circumstances your overall health is good. Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause... <+++++> It couldn't have been earlier?
Yeah. Basketball just, isn't fun anymore. You know? <+++++> No.
I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her. <+++++> You will not, then?
What are you talking about? <+++++> Use some common sense! Setting off a fire alarm causes panic...the same kind of panic caused by suggesting Jason Voorhees is on board.
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree. <+++++> I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
What was it? <+++++> Nothing.
I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play. <+++++> They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling... THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE! <+++++> You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone? <+++++> I don't know what to say to him. I can't.
You said something was strange. What's strange? <+++++> The footprints.
Oh, hey, Patrick. <+++++> Hi, Mary. How's it going?
Not yet. <+++++> But, he's...
It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion? <+++++> Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
Bet he makes it. <+++++> You're on.
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter. <+++++> What're you talking about? He's a heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
Get out, Will. <+++++> Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.
What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate? <+++++> Out? Are you kidding? I've got all the fixings here.
OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town. <+++++> I am from outa town.
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't. <+++++> There are lots of reasons. Do you want to come up?
I don't buy it. <+++++> You don't buy what?

As some kind of ... of ... crooks? <+++++> They will understand, sir. To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions.
What'd you say to her? <+++++> Told her my name. Then she said somethin' like, 'It's so noisy down here.
Moss...Who told him? <+++++> How the fuck do I know? What...talk to me.
Donny! Please! <+++++> Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--
Nobody seems to want to do anythingÂ  Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what? <+++++> About what? Your marriage to Anne!
Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon. <+++++> So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you. <+++++> Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here? <+++++> That's part of it.
And he never hit you before? <+++++> Never touched me.
Nikki. <+++++> Thank you, Nikki.
What? <+++++> What are you doing down there?
Really? <+++++> I had the Christopher Marlowe in my boat once.
Very much. <+++++> I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
What can I get for you tonight. <+++++> How about your phone number?
He found us, he shot her...he killed her... <+++++> Booth, listen to me...Booth!
Where criminals can come in here... they take the... <+++++> They stole the phones. They stole the leads. They're...Christ. What am I going to do this month? Oh, shit...
No news yet? <+++++> No. No word.
D'Agosta? Ippolito. Come in. <+++++> Where the hell are you?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. <+++++> I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely.
You deserve better than Simone. I've got to go, Dad. <+++++> Lainey...
The guy's bats all right. He's bat shit crazy. He --  -- I can't believe it. I was right! ! <+++++> Allie, he's not.
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture. <+++++> You? You kiddin'? If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime. <+++++> What time?
I can't kill my own father. <+++++> Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
Even though he knew about you? <+++++> Yes.
And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent. <+++++> Bullshit. It's all coincidence.
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing. <+++++> What?
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But -- <+++++> As far as I can tell he hasn't thought his life through. He'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car. But business?
When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen. <+++++> Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial? You'd have to give me your word.
You don't have to do it for a living. <+++++> No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest.
You need a break. You'll see it clear when you come back. <+++++> I can't
I came here to save you. <+++++> Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior? ?
But it's not the same. <+++++> That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good.
Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately. <+++++> Right away, Exposition.
Excellent. <+++++> What's playing there?
-- I don't know -- <+++++> Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor?
So, what does it mean. The ark sank and the sun set? <+++++> He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.
A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor. <+++++> A what kind of doctor?
Two-man job. How much blood has he had? <+++++> Second pint.
Corporal, the Roughnecks are moving out for Planet P immediately. Get yourself squared away and report to Gillespie for logistics. <+++++> Yes, sir !
There was no letter. <+++++> I sent three men to Webb!
No. <+++++> Have you had any before?
Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more. <+++++> You can't do this! Max! Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's -- <+++++> -- What are you doing here?
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff. --Lest you call paper odd. <+++++> Newspapers?
When is she supposed to return? <+++++> I have no idea. Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.
Well, honey, just grab some other toy! Now c'mon! <+++++> Okay...
I think it's an energy form, sir... <+++++> Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
Dago, wop, garlic-breath, guinea, pizza-slinging, spaghetti-bending, Vic Damone, Perry Como, Luciano Pavarotti, Sole Mio, nonsinging motherfucker. <+++++> You gold-teeth, gold-chain-wearing, fried-chicken-and-biscuit-eatin', monkey, ape, baboon, big thigh, fast-running, three-hundred-sixty- degree-basketball-dunking spade Moulan Yan.
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when -- <+++++> Is he Italian?
Please, except my humblest apologies... <+++++> Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I must go to visit my good friend George Rutagunda. You know George?
You're well built; how old are you? <+++++> Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
I dunno, boy. <+++++> The educational process.
Zero risk. <+++++> 'Cause you don't lose loads?
At my house...! <+++++> Call a cruiser!
Wendy and I--we're meant to be. I'm right, right? I have to see her... <+++++> Say Hi for me.
He rides tonight. <+++++> Father saw you die.
What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just... <+++++> Just what? Doing a little dusting?
Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over. <+++++> See, you made him somethin'. Hey Vaughan, I was just goin' on with you, jokin' around, buddy.
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now. <+++++> I don't know what good that'll do. Chickens won't eat.
Suck my ass. <+++++> Terrific.
I just can't look at you. <+++++> Don't, then.
You can't sell me that, Walter. <+++++> Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE? <+++++> Let me ask you, why do you wear black ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from?
Hello. Hello, Leon. <+++++> Hello, Sonny.
Don't worry, I can take it. <+++++> You shouldn't be here.
That would take five minutes. For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship. <+++++> I am not a thief...
I don't even know how to live with myself. <+++++> Just think about it.
No poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix. <+++++> When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...
Maybe go back to school. <+++++> Wow.
 <+++++> BREAN, SHAKING HIS HEAD. IN THE B.G., MOSS, DRINKING. THE TV COMES TO LIFE.
You should have heard her play. <+++++> Stop.
What's he doing? <+++++> He's on to a new thing.
I thought you'd killed Freddy off. <+++++> We did. Bad mistake. The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right?
That little girl? Ha. Now go on, get me some tools. <+++++> There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there. <+++++> Son, have a look in his locker.
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham! <+++++> I thought I was the bad guy!
What other job you got? <+++++> Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
Hot damn, boy, I almost believe you did sell your soul to the devil! <+++++> Boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. You just sign these papers and I'll give you ten dollars apiece.
I ain't a priest, Lieutenant. I can't hear your confession. <+++++> Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch. <+++++> Yes -- and for me, it's going to leave at any minute. Let's drink.
Hi. I brought some wine. <+++++> Thank you, won't you come in ?
I had it impounded. Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam. <+++++> Back to jail in my own car. Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
I got two minutes. <+++++> Very good.
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard. <+++++> Pull back. You're only an observer.
Aye. He's enchanted the lot of them. His reward for delivering the unicorn. <+++++> Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
You did that? <+++++> Eighty-two thousand dollars.
It's corny, but I could live with it. <+++++> What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
I mean, I mean, I can't take it right away. I'm still recuperating, I just dropped in to say hello, see everybody -- <+++++> I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this. <+++++> Always thought "can't" wasn't in a man's vocabulary.
 <+++++> Well, if it's a real mourning ring,.
I don't know. <+++++> Mommy's not home?
Whah? <+++++> Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it?
But Sergeant... <+++++> Give me a break, Sanchez. It's like riding a bike.
They're still the same. Piss holes in the snow. <+++++> Still got a sense of humour?
To do business. <+++++> I can help you.
I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them. I've been riding in the desert ever since. <+++++> And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit. He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.
It's why you attract a client like my daughter. <+++++> Probably.
I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name? <+++++> Ben Schwarz.
Looks like we got a Mexican standoff. <+++++> Slide the shotgun over here, put your hands behind your head, put your forehead on the floor.
Don't even think about it. <+++++> Why not?
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago. <+++++> Right. So why is he dying? He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
Thank you. I understand you're an interior decorator. <+++++> Yes.
Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... . <+++++> I'm glad what I done today, see?
I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe. <+++++> You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder.
Well, sure! <+++++> Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet. But you can bring someone if you like.
They want more time to think about investing. <+++++> Goddamnit.
Oh yeah. <+++++> I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple. That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.
What are you doing? <+++++> Pretend we're just another couple.
Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer... <+++++> I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...
I know. <+++++> That's where your talent lies.
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all. Is that not so, Marie Antoinette? <+++++> 
It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size. Am I correct, Bishop? <+++++> Oh yes, my lady.
Uh huh. <+++++> Okay, OW!
Cute cat. What's his name. <+++++> Peptic ulcer.
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry? <+++++> No.
Now I'm going to ask him how come he couldn't be at your birthday. <+++++> Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
Where is Friedman? <+++++> Look, I donÂt think youÂre fully aware of what youÂre playing with here, Mister.
She said that? <+++++> You weren't really interested in Suez at all. Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.
You did not know? <+++++> Well...no, not really --
In the passenger car? <+++++> Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
Please. <+++++> 
Three agents killed by bad weather... <+++++> ... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere. <+++++> I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now.
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude. <+++++> Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was... <+++++> I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's.
So you really think she means you're going with her? <+++++> Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point. That's not the point at all!
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi? <+++++> I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever. It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary.
You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right? <+++++> Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
Theodore Herzel. <+++++> Huh?
Then go get him. <+++++> That wouldn't be very sporting.
Shame you had to spot I wasnÂt the real thing. <+++++> So who are you?
...what do you got? <+++++> Military Special Programs... <u>Programs</u>... No, I am not Shouting at you, I'm... I'm sorry.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him. <+++++> Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those... <+++++> ...men every time I've closed my eyes? But after you went away, I--
Well, she's got a point. <+++++> We'll cover your escape!
No, sir. <+++++> It's haunted just the same.
He's given it to us. <+++++> Hah, you're very cunning Ada, but I've seen through you, I'm not going to lose the land this way. Wait here!
You know it is! <+++++> I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password? <+++++> I come to Grandma's funeral. Here's your admission card.
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off. <+++++> Did you request this case?
You have a thing against museums? <+++++> I got nothing against--
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there. <+++++> 
So, where'd you go today. <+++++> Around.
Peter, I... I... <+++++> And don't forget. I have the key.
It'll hold! <+++++> For sixty seconds, maybe! Look at this! You could-
You don't think so, huh? <+++++> Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...
He already knew it. <+++++> Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer. I'm sorry. <+++++> I understand.
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma. <+++++> Thanks, Valentine ...
Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident. <+++++> Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
I'll be there in three hours. <+++++> Don't speed, Chase. It's not...
James, what are you doing here? <+++++> You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
I don't know. I don't think so. <+++++> So?...
I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project? <+++++> I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all.
Money. Follow the money. <+++++> Sir?
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here? <+++++> White turns to black. Light to Dark. Life to Death. For all eternity.
You know all about me. <+++++> I don't know anything that isn't police business.
What do you mean? <+++++> When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left?
You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state. <+++++> That must make it tough.
What kind of jewel is this? <+++++> I don't know.
And we're here on the couch... <+++++> Don't say that...
There goes my chance with Sid. <+++++> Like you had one.
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff. <+++++> Okay. Also, I want you to put our bases in Turkey on alert, and have the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike.
Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle? <+++++> And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
All right, who ate the last piece of cheesecake? <+++++> I didn't.
No argument. <+++++> Oh Christ. Julia...
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer. Just be being with me. <+++++> I didn't give you cancer, Laurie. Not you, not the others. I don't know what did.
You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes! <+++++> I was mistaken.
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed. <+++++> 
I'll see you, then. <+++++> Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way. <+++++> Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money. <+++++> Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.
 <+++++> Come on, come on!
Like a blueprint for disembowelment. <+++++> There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
Said what! <+++++> I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.
Gimme back my bottle. <+++++> Let go of my hair.
I know. Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left. <+++++> What are you doing, Plank?
It's what I do. Quinn...Halloran. I'll wait. Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here? <+++++> Out. Where does he go? Nowhere. What does he do? Nothing.
Twenty-thousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on. <+++++> How much could you get?
Fine. <+++++> Want me to take this for you?
Watch? -- <+++++> I'll come by your place, right after...drink, take pills... Love you.
Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma? <+++++> What else? I gave her a schaff [Italian-American slang for 'tap'.]
What dya mean? <+++++> This is a private club. You're not welcome.
It's a good thought. <+++++> It won't play.
I'll be out in a minute. <+++++> I'm sorry about my parents.
A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now. <+++++> And who might that be?
Zuzu Petals! Did she have it? <+++++> Have what?
Did we warn them off? <+++++> Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
I don't know. Who do you want? <+++++> Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
Daddy, what is going on? <+++++> And make sure my daughter stays put...  ...She's grounded.
Clips. <+++++> That's right. Clips. Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here. This isn't like TV only better.
I'm meeting someone. <+++++> Ah. Where?
I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano. <+++++> We can operate around these guys.
Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us. <+++++> They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's? <+++++> This Denny's.
Always? <+++++> Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
Well that was for your sculpture of the girl. Your nude in the chair. <+++++> Carla -
I see you have your Luca Brasi. <+++++> I'll need him.
Okay. <+++++> Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
Well. <+++++> Benjamin.
That's enough of that kind of talk! <+++++> I just said--
In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates. <+++++> We will be happy to beam down. But first we must have certain assurances.
Business auditions for us...  ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us <u>before</u> Nicholas calls. <+++++> That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time.
You don't want the extra police pay? <+++++> I'm not saying that.
I mean -- her apartment. <+++++> What's your friend's name?
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it. <+++++> How can we? We're broke.
You a fag too? <+++++> 
...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man. <+++++> Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
Are you all right? <+++++> Find Valentin! Find him! Get him in here!
Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick. <+++++> Like where?
No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90! <+++++> Close.
What do you got there, Diego? <+++++> Nothing. Just a little project.
Why does God let there be bad things? <+++++> I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
I'm trying to get you a girlfriend. <+++++> Well, yeah, thank you, but --
Check the immediate area. <+++++> This was supposed to be a...
Very soon. <+++++> Thank God.
What if they serve soup? <+++++> They will serve salad.
He wants to talk to you. <+++++> Now it's okay?
Midshipman, you're a tiger. <+++++> My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
It's different now. Help me. <+++++> How can I?
Who did it? Now wait a minute. <+++++> Hickory!
0h, shit! <+++++> You don't think...
What d'you expect? <+++++> You know, baby, I can't figure you out.
I miss Murray, Harry. <+++++> Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on -- <+++++> So what happened? Where are they, then?
I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE <+++++> What?
Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game. They should be here by four. <+++++> Okay.
What's New Orleans like this time of year? Mardi Gras. Or let's just see where the road takes us. <+++++> Let me out, Truman. You're not right in the head. You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own!
Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee? <+++++> You're welcome to one.
What happened? <+++++> By the time I got back to the party our ambassador was face-down, in a bed of bloody azaleas.
You've met the press bunch, haven't you? <+++++> Oh, yes--they're fine people--regular people.
Good. I'm glad <+++++> How many did I get right?
You want to know how I kissed him? <+++++> Yes...
Don't pay to complain. <+++++> You on your way home?
Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away... <+++++> Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
Go away! <+++++> Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries ...
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE! <+++++> Oh sure.
Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman -- <+++++> And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career. <+++++> I think she's trying that.
I don't really understand the meaning of the words. <+++++> If y'all don't shut up I'm gonna go out of my mind. And plus you're liable to bust a spring in Karl's head.
Roach...Roach, come on. <+++++> Where's Craig?
What about your agent? Hear anything yet? <+++++> Nope.
Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet? I am. This is Vivian. You two been together long? You and Edward? <+++++> No.
Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement? <+++++> I have.
How old are you? <+++++> You know how old I am.
They never caught on. <+++++> They may. That's why I would keep my mouth shut.
On V-J Day he wept and prayed again. <+++++> Joseph, now show him what happened today.
I wanna go home! <+++++> Yeah, it's cold!
I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman. <+++++> Is that what you think? Is that what you think I think?
Why would you suppose so? <+++++> Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear. <+++++> I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
Great. <+++++> I'll tape it for you.
You. You're the guy that lent me the money. <+++++> Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye. <+++++> Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card. <+++++> A card?
We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia. Should have it all in about an hour or so. <+++++> Excellent.
No, no! I'm sorry! What is it? <+++++> This is for me.
She's working on another lead right now. <+++++> Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing. <+++++> I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh? <+++++> More or less. Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.
That's it. Just do it, all right? <+++++> 10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people. <+++++> Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
Oh God! I am just so personally horrified right now ... <+++++> I just don't think we have the right to ...
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much. <+++++> No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one.
...Ya gave Dipper my locker. <+++++> I'm sorry, I -- I made a mistake. Kid, I'm askin' man to man. I wanna be ya manager.
Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young? <+++++> I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.
That's scary sounding. <+++++> Exactly!
Why are they after <u>me</u>? <+++++> If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
 <+++++> Yeah.
Where're you going? <+++++> Be back in a minute. If Stan calls you, just tell him I went to Embers. Oh, geez -
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it. <+++++> Excuse me.
Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it - <+++++> Just hold-on there --
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out. <+++++> How?
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired. <+++++> You know what we want.
Let's go in the bedroom. <+++++> No.
So...got the keys to heaven, baby. <+++++> What?
Well, I - <+++++> You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home. <+++++> We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet. <+++++> No, really I --
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet. <+++++> I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days.
What are you talking about? <+++++> I've seen that kamikaze look, Johnny. You've got it. And Bodhi can smell it a mile away.
-- you are. <+++++> Fuckin' A --
Can you make him stop! <+++++> Mind letting me make the best of a rotten situation?
I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan. <+++++> I know very well what you're talking about. You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you.
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there. <+++++> And his wife?
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby. <+++++> I didn't notice him.
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out. <+++++> I have to go face to face.
Liza Sutton is dead. <+++++> Then I can't be hurt anymore.
Throw that money in the River! In THE RIVER! <+++++> IN THE RIIV-ER!
Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene. You know what they'd do. <+++++> He would have done it to us, right?
What's she see in that douchebag? <+++++> That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties.
Somewhere near the capital? <+++++> No maglev system.
Magnificent, magnificent. <+++++> Well I appreciate that.
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind. <+++++> I can sea its breath in the cold.
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right? <+++++> Are you sweating?
My father and the Baron. <+++++> Damned hunters. It was a trap, and you were the bait!
Swiped your purse! While he was saving you? You gotta be kidding! <+++++> And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.
Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples... <+++++> Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
Bigger and better. <+++++> Then how come you're talking to me?
Too early to tell. Nervous? <+++++> Nah.
It all started with our mission in Istanbul. <+++++> Yeah.
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous. <+++++> Sir?
You went from high school to the Agency? <+++++> No. I graduated from George Washington University. Then I entered the Agency training program.
Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans? I read your book last night. <+++++> No, I don't.
Oh, yeh. But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell. <+++++> And then your stroke came this summer. And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.
My pocket. Check my pocket, will ya, honey? <+++++> Your pocket?
Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We thought you'd disappeared. We were going to send out a search party. <+++++> No, still here.
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best. <+++++> No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest. Or what about Faulkner? Or that little guy with the glasses?
If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it! Nothing! <+++++> Look Blair, maybe you're right about this. But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep. <+++++> Men are very sensitive, you know. We need to feel loved and desired, too.
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant? <+++++> Her own people start to suspect her, it creates discord from within.
I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out.... <+++++> We don't have anything straightened out. You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
Momo could buy it, I could run it for him. Show some Cagney films. <+++++> What's Momo gonna want with an old place, shows old movies people don't care about no more.
That's my leg. <+++++> I know what it is.
For Sugai. Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you. <+++++> So I bring some cheese?
What is this "Dead Potts Society"? I want names. <+++++> It's only me, Mr. Nolan. I swear. I made it up.
From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it? Pink Floyd concert receipts. Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time? <+++++> Hardly buried. Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
Who's she? <+++++> Don't know. Who is she?
I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative. <+++++> Yeah.
Look, snap out of it, will ya? <+++++> Kiss me.
What I am. <+++++> -- which is --
Thank you. <+++++> Otherwise, you're a Mongoloid idiot.
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge! <+++++> Ha.
Is that your version of a pep talk? <+++++> You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
Stanzi! <+++++> No, it's right he should hear. I'm sick to death of it. We can't do anything right for you, can we?
Article 42! You don't mean-? ! <+++++> Yes Principal Victoria. The PTA is impeaching you.
This interview's over! The militia stays! <+++++> Does the rule of English law no longer govern? Has it been replaced by absolutism?
Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame. <+++++> It is?
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone? <+++++> Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
Then there's no chance for recall? <+++++> I should say practically none, though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination.
Good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter? <+++++> I can't get it to come out right.
I'm in serious violation of medical ethics. <+++++> We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
Hello, Mr. Valiant. I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it. <+++++> That's because I don't have a doorbell.
Fifteen million dollars. <+++++> Right. Right. So that's... fairly good. On the high side... have you tried the nuts?
I'll have the same. <+++++> Of course.
It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me. You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you. <+++++> Well, you run on now.
Who told you that? <+++++> Mrs...
Holy shit... <+++++> ...man!
Your friends use the pool too. <+++++> I take out the garbage.
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job. She paid with a Visa card. <+++++> Here are tonight's calls.
You were about to recognize me, sir-- <+++++> That is merely your *impression*, Senator. The Chair has yet to settle the question to its own satisfaction!
Try it. <+++++> No fucking way.
I have to check the upper lines. Gabor will drive you back. <+++++> Always wanted to see the upper lines.
I'll wait. <+++++> Don't be silly. I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
"What?" Look at you... You sense a mark. <+++++> Hey -- you called me... I...
Room service speaking. <+++++> Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good!
You seem to know what youÂre talking about. <+++++> Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little.
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill. <+++++> Amnesia?
Into what? <+++++> Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice. <+++++> Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence -
It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab. We'll be out in no time. <+++++> I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine? <+++++> Come here for a minute, first.
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me? <+++++> Yes.
Look, what you said yesterday... I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together. <+++++> I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
How do you do? What can I get you, what're you drinking? <+++++> Nothing's changed. Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ? <+++++> Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.
Napalm. <+++++> Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --
Don't feed that dog. <+++++> You people really don't like dogs.
No sign of 'em... <+++++> INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there? Did I ever tell you my Nike story? <+++++> I gotta get back to Cushman.
L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester. <+++++> Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate... <+++++> Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?
Why should it? <+++++> That's right... Take one of these.
It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances. <+++++> I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
And then you weren't there. <+++++> Right. I'm sorry.
You okay? <+++++> Yeah, I guess so.
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room. <+++++> Your boyfriend?
What does that do? <+++++> What do you mean, what's it do?
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out. <+++++> He talked to you?
So what do you think that is, Hennessy? <+++++> A hotel?
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake. <+++++> You needn't use that language with me
But he's a basket case. Someone stole Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, too. <+++++> I heard.
Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main? All they know is killing and white uniforms. <+++++> All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
Commander?... Where are you... going? <+++++> Home.
We're almost married. <+++++> We're not married <u>yet</u>.
Shit... <+++++> Check your read-out.
That's it. It's over. Get out. <+++++> So I guess a blowjob's out of the question?
Yeah? <+++++> Two... Yeah. Lotta, lotta trouble. There's two of 'em.
What? <+++++> She is not your birth mother, is she?
No one yet, far as I can tell. It has gone intestate. <+++++> In test... what?
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc. <+++++> I am.
Mr. Taylor? <+++++> No, that's not Mr. Taylor.
I love you! Have a cigar! <+++++> Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar. Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it. <+++++> I'll find it myself.
Okay, I'll help you. Should we make some dip or something? <+++++> He is the Destructor.
That remote control thing? <+++++> Yeah.
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to... <+++++> Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish. <+++++> Who'd care?
Didn't you see <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>? <+++++> What? ?
Oh, listen to teacher's pet. <+++++> You crawler.
Argon's private lab. <+++++> Let's go.
Goodbye, darling. <+++++> Goodbye, darling!
No, we're jake. But listen- <+++++> Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've found natural locations for the whole story--
I know. Everybody tells me. <+++++> Johnny, the doctors explained --
You look so beautiful. <+++++> Come on.
I think so, but I can't get close enough. There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more. <+++++> Find out anything you can...you got a Grand coming.
Ma. Pa.  Grampa, his eyes hurt and hunted and frightened and bewildered, scratches in the dirt. <+++++> And can't nobody *make* me go, either! Ain't nobody here *man* enough to make me! I'm a-stayin'.
All these parties are so marvellously <u>alike</u>. <+++++> They should be... But there's something funny about that soldier.
My face tell you all that? <+++++> It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress. She and I - we' not built the same way. <+++++> We can have it altered.
Father, I have sinned... <+++++> We'll talk about that later.
Stay away from me, Jez. <+++++> I want to know. You tell me!
Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST! <+++++> Uncle Al-
Looks like you're bailing out at the right time. <+++++> That's why you get the big bucks, Captain.
Yeah, well. I'm working on that. I've got something going. <+++++> Yeah? I better see some money out of it.
Balint? <+++++> It's German.
Hi. I know you! I've seen you down at the Jabberjaw plenty. <+++++> Yes, you have. Can I come in?
Man, she's losing it... <+++++> It's about time. Isn't Fun great?
No! <+++++> Everybody goes home!
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising. <+++++> There would be a moon tonight.
Everything? <+++++> Everything. Just for the record.
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you? <+++++> I've been great. And you?
I was with Jessie, she filled me in. <+++++> Now let me fill you in. You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
Back out? You don't need <u>us</u> to get laid. You afraid or something? <+++++> No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
Yes, but. <+++++> Then, shut up!
And what did your parents do? <+++++> My father worked in televison. My mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian.
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said: <+++++> So what. Infatuation is good, too.
Were they wearing condoms? <+++++> Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't.
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present? <+++++> What would you like? Texas?
Said he stole his invention. <+++++> Do you suppose.....  ?
Then come with me. <+++++> Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit. <+++++> Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
This is my man, you dig? My informant. You know what an informant is? <+++++> Stooly.
You have such a head for knowing. You know everything. <+++++> I brought you something.
Why, then is my pump well flowered. <+++++> Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
I don't know what to say. Look, I -- I just - <+++++> Enjoyed it?
Well, at least you're accomplished at something... <+++++> What?
Then? <+++++> I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here? <+++++> He's no magician.
Yeah. "Itchy" sent us. <+++++> She did, did she? How is the old girl?
You've passed me on the street almost every day. <+++++> Me?
Yes. <+++++> I was wondering. What if before the court date gets here, Beaumont gets hit by a bus or something and dies.
Yeah. But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia. By the way, chalk up two more terrorists. <+++++> They boys'll be glad. We got a pool going on you.
Don't be shy. There's time to stop before you go too far. <+++++> I guess.
Ya puttin' me on, right? <+++++> Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
Multiple reasons. <+++++> Name one.
Say again, sir? <+++++> You heard me. Move on.
Are you taking your medication? <+++++> It gives me headaches.
Hurricane kept you up, too? <+++++> Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.
Fifteen years in El Paso. <+++++> Made some money, came back here--
I don't want anything. I'm just a really big, big fan. I've seen all your movies. <+++++> Ha!
Where are you going, Baxter? <+++++> Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
FIRES a burst. Germans drops. <+++++> FIRES a burst. More Germans drop.
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something. <+++++> Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that. <+++++> Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
C'mon. Let me take you home. <+++++> No.
Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik? <+++++> Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
It's alright, baby. <+++++> Who was he, Momma? He tried to kill us.
How did you do that? <+++++> Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger. I brought you here to warn you.
Back, Kelly. Lean back! <+++++> Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
Yep. That's the best way. It's that boom boom boom. <+++++> Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
What happened? <+++++> Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think.
Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding. <+++++> Yes.
You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you? <+++++> Where do you fit?
Tis not fit for a princess. <+++++> Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
I think it's not horrible. <+++++> I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
Is this one art deco or art nouveau? <+++++> Deco.
You can't go in there! <+++++> Don't try to stop me!
How you be? <+++++> I be. I'm living large.
If you shut up I'll tell you. The urgent message is...Drop everything! Craig is in trouble. Come quick, don't call. <+++++> That ain't gonna work.
You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An internist. And I think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist, as well. <+++++> She told you about...
When I'm dead--  or fucking. <+++++> Paul said you were awfully sick.
Claudia, listen to me... <+++++> No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor...
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie. <+++++> I'm trying.
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back. I mean, I just couldn't live... <+++++> I know. I know what you mean. I don't wanna end up on the damn Geraldo Show.
Hm. The wind's northwest. That oughta be...Seattle. <+++++> Or I may be wrong. The breeze could be gusting south. That'd be Billings...
Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston? <+++++> Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you. <+++++> You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director.
I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you... <+++++> Dies?
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about? <+++++> Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas? Everybody just talk out loud. <+++++> I've always liked the format of Rowan and Martin's "LAUGH-IN."
Just call me later. I gotta get some smokes for Grandma. <+++++> Don't use big bills!
He's heading under -- ! <+++++> No way! He can't!
You said you were here all day? <+++++> Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
Yeah, she's here. <+++++> I'll be right there.
You think I'm an asshole. <+++++> Didn't know you read minds.
What's your name? <+++++> Easy.
Yes, sir. But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up. <+++++> Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member. <+++++> Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert.
I can't... <+++++> You have to! Quickly!
What do you mean? <+++++> Kid, you gave them what they wanted. This committee, it feeds on names. The more names, the better.
We're going to have to work on your touch. <+++++> I like the sound of that.
He might tell me about Julia. The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse. Who wants to be redeemed. <+++++> This is Stargher we're talking about?
I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"! <+++++> Oh, Leon!
Ilene, Rick promised... <+++++> Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs.
Right. In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night. <+++++> Jesus! Why didn't you tell me?
Who's your suspect? <+++++> A man named Tim Ma-...
What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting. <+++++> And you no longer play at all?
You looking for me? <+++++> Not exactly. Just thought I'd sit down and rest my dogs a minute.
Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body? <+++++> Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
The tip is, anyhow. I like to work on your hair. <+++++> Thank you.
Where did it originate? <+++++> In another time, another dimension. It was brought here long ago by the "Nathadians", a people who are now all but extinct.
What is your name, young lady? <+++++> Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane." I'm already 30! <+++++> Ed, you're still young. This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
Not exactly. <+++++> Why?
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years. <+++++> He's just confessed. He's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town.
See if you've been making it with my mother. <+++++> What would my being a faggot have to do with that?
You must think I am a monster. <+++++> No, but what a pity life is like that.
I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written. <+++++> Thank you for thinking of me. Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying?
It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein? <+++++> Rogers isn't even pretending. He isn't just scared anymore. He's sick.
He left with Sophie. <+++++> What?! !
I'm not sure. A virus -- <+++++> -- You saw this experiment?
Yeah ... <+++++> What department store did they go to?
I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that? <+++++> Sure.
<i>They can do subtitles.</i> <+++++> <i>Choco grew up on the streets of El Salvador.
Yeah, I remember. <+++++> How would you like to take me to dinner?
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange. <+++++> I will, Mary -- always thought a man could be stronger alone -- seems I've been wrong about that.
What does she say? The woman. <+++++> Asks my name. Over and over. Just like a broken record. Only thing is, I can't answer.
'...I don't know if I can make it.' That's what I said. But I didn't leave. <+++++> No, she threw you out. What a difficult woman.
Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls. <+++++> Please, can I have one to surge with?
You wouldn't by any chance be - <+++++> My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me? <+++++> Okay, I'm thinking.
And you will. But not now. <+++++> I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.
Sounds like another one of your stories to me. <+++++> She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge, though, she was divorced.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl. <+++++> We eat when I say we eat.
But how? Where do you place Paul that night? <+++++> According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
To survive, you have to go into deep hiding. And that's going to take money, a lot of money. <+++++> Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha. <+++++> You can admit that, can't you?
I came up here to sneak a smoke. <+++++> You were smoking?
Oh - nothing. No extra charge. <+++++> That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro? <+++++> Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
Who's writing this guy's lines? <+++++> Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
-- it was a betrayal. <+++++> Yes. But it wasn't really. It was just...
I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster." <+++++> You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
This is the President. <+++++> Yeah, right.
What's your favorite movie star? <+++++> Burt Reynolds.
You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals. <+++++> No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky. How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
No more fights? <+++++> No more fights.
Who asked you? <+++++> But, Jake, I was just...
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing. <+++++> No more.
Drove into Sierra? What for? <+++++> Didn't have a choice. My car overheated up the road.
Relax. <+++++> Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally... <+++++> There's not much illegal.
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant! <+++++> You bet.
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment. <+++++> Come up here a minute.
Oh, no problem at all. I made the trip in three and a half hours. <+++++> Well, that's very good time, very good. Please sit down a minute.
Michael! Get behind the wheel. <+++++> Huh?...
Marc Shermin. <+++++> Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days.
Now you've done it! <+++++> Done what?
I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system. <+++++> What sort of signature?
Yeah. <+++++> It's an esoteric journey.
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer. <+++++> Hey, Chil? I think you're fulla shit.
I think it'll be a success ... <+++++> Yes, I think so too ... It's been organized well ... But what will the French do?
You won't be long? <+++++> I'll join you shortly.
Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump? <+++++> But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
Well, that's blunt! <+++++> I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors. <+++++> Some of my best friends are scientists. They're saying the machine is alive.
No, the children sleep with me. <+++++> Give them to Refugio.
Has anyone seen Greg? <+++++> He's probably outside. You know how he is. Gets bored...
You want to make me look like him... <+++++> No. Want to make you into something new. That nobody recognizes...
We're just feeling our way back. <+++++> "Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here."
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend. <+++++> Really?
What a guy <+++++> Makes you cry
Wow. Why would they do that? <+++++> Cause of the chromium.
Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there. <+++++> Ah.
Yes, but only in the dream they call life. <+++++> Dream? !
Don't shoot. <+++++> I've enjoyed being man.
Janet, are you okay? Are you there? <+++++> He... he's here...
What'll happen to us, Nell? <+++++> Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us. Don't get in the way, please.
You know what pisses me off the most? <+++++> The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
This is not what I requested. <+++++> No, sir.
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe. <+++++> I see blood. Maybe you got him, Hank.
It does concern me. <+++++> Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.
It's your game. I've never played this before. <+++++> It's not a game. Something you play.
He's been pretending to help you. * Feeding you a line of crap about John G.		    * being some local drug dealer. * <+++++> How do you know this?
 <+++++> You're goin' a find me dead one time.
You would do that, your Majesty? <+++++> My dear, I've already done it.
I'll tell you sometime. Not now. Don't want to jinx it. But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming. <+++++> What are you talking about?
That's right brother... listen and learn. <+++++> The white power structure wants us to act like savages. But we're a different kind of animal altogether. We're Panthers.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, it's a bed and hot water. <+++++> It does look good.
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you. <+++++> I can't wait.
How come you're calling me from...? <+++++> This is Miss Costello...?
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines? <+++++> I said go ahead.
It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please! <+++++> Please, lady. Please be quiet. Everything will be all right. Open up here, folks. All right, folks, please!
'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive? <+++++> Who knows.
Whatcha wanta order? <+++++> I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...
Don't call me old man. Ain't you got no respect, boy? <+++++> You want something?
That would imply you already knew the number. <+++++> I got it from the tournament directory.
You try it. <+++++> Me, sir?
Their radio's out too. Gennaro said to stay put. <+++++> The kids okay?
What's that, peanut? <+++++> One person thinks he's doin' somethin' good and ever'body else gets upset about it.
Mr. Saavik, all stop. <+++++> All stop, sir.
How far is it, scout? <+++++> Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see. <+++++> Do you ever do any writing?
I've heard good things about their London branch. You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense. <+++++> You want to know what it is? What it's all about? John. Chapter nine. Verse twenty-five.
Which way? Right or left? <+++++> Who knows? Right.
What's the story on Jimmy Gardner? <+++++> Gardner? Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here. Why?
You've got a stupid accent too. <+++++> Eric, that is not appropriate.
Not now. <+++++> What is wrong with you?
I was set up. She looked at least eighteen. <+++++> You get us access to the Tessier's computer and you can return to Earth anytime you want. A free man.
You said the "s" word. <+++++> Yeah. Sorry.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on. <+++++> It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
He's being arraigned tomorrow. <+++++> I read about it in the paper.
Excuse meÂ <+++++> Wait a minute. How do you feel this morning?
What do you mean? <+++++> I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
I see. How do I get down there? <+++++> Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to... <+++++> I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial.
But I didn't do this! <+++++> The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
Yes. <+++++> It did.
Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing? Whatever the price? Isn't that what makes a man? <+++++> Sure. That and a pair of testicles.
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's -- <+++++> Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
What? <+++++> This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down?
What are they looking at? <+++++> You- they cannot believe you're still here.
What cha say, Benny -- Meet 'The Rock.' This is our cutman, Benny Stein. <+++++> Yo, Benny.
Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us? We're trying to settle a bet. <+++++> Uh-oh.
Oh God. . . <+++++> Relax, George. It's gonna go great. Trust me. Have I ever lied to you?
I want to go live with you. <+++++> [And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses. <+++++> You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff. <+++++> So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
We'd like to hire you. <+++++> Really?
I'd better get back now. <+++++> You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
Come on, Elden, think about it. The driver, all them trunks standing open like that... something's going on here! <+++++> I know that...
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it. <+++++> What time did you make it for?
I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool. <+++++> You made squad leader on your own, and, hey, you still got me to kick around.
HOLY SHIT! ! <+++++> You okay?
Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...? <+++++> What is the five grand? What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ... <+++++> Sounds fantastic. You know some kids came up here the other night to go swimming--took off all their clothes.
I saw that in a nickelodeon once, and I always wanted to do it. <+++++> Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.
I thought I knew everything about him. <+++++> Can we split now?
What you are? You would be something other than you are? <+++++> And if I cut my hair again?
Do you understand that? <+++++> Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
I don't know a loud crash. <+++++> And what about screaming?
I can't help it. It just keeps ringing. <+++++> And I can't keep you interested?
Are you kidding? You're not kidding? You're not kidding! <+++++> You won it. You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.
No! I look ridiculous! <+++++> Come out! I can do alterations.
You want a drink? <+++++> Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
Margo, really... <+++++> 
Time and space have no meaning out here. We're living in Einsteinian equation. <+++++> I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion. <+++++> Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.
Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures. <+++++> Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.
It's all the same to me. <+++++> So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride. Is that it?
Why is that? <+++++> I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
Hi Vada. <+++++> Hi.
Have I ever said a bad word to you about your father? <+++++> No.
Look! Police! <+++++> I know. I called them.
It was... Fantastic. <+++++> Oh come on. For her first time?
No problem... Shit. I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it. <+++++> The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay.
Yes. <+++++> That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do? <+++++> What are you talking about?
You're very... kind. <+++++> It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
...now! <+++++> INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
Yes, your Eminence. The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks. <+++++> Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle? Erathostene? Ptolemeus?
Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee! <+++++> Black or regular?
I think Santos or Marietta Fortune. <+++++> Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
So what's my share of the dress? <+++++> Thirty-two dollars.
Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent? <+++++> Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response." <+++++> You will respect the law.
Yeah? <+++++> Everything okay?
Tracy. <+++++> Ethics are...
Nothing. <+++++> What'd he think it was to you?
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you? <+++++> Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy. Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.
Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world -- <+++++> Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
They're harder to do than they look. <+++++> Oh? You've tried?
What? <+++++> I asked if you felt like a drink--
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him? <+++++> In the camps, we were lodged four to a room. The selection process was entirely random.
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me. <+++++> Why not break it up yourself? You could do it in two minutes flat.
Yeah. <+++++> Why he's argumentative?
What the hell is that supposed to mean? <+++++> It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure.
Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today. <+++++> Really? That's amazing.
I agree -- <+++++> Why?
Covered. <+++++> How many?
That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me. <+++++> Daddy --
What it's all about. What this whole trip has meant. But then, the <u>really</u> big issues keep swamping y... <+++++> Brad Kovitsky.
Any survivors? <+++++> Negative.
Not many. <+++++> Well, when you run out of weapons, just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em sing for their supper.
No! What's going on? Where's my family? <+++++> It's over, Jake. It's all over.
That's a canopy, John. <+++++> Ohhh...
No, no jokes, I gotta pee. Just tell me about your day. What went on back there? <+++++> Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here. Beth started talking.
You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts? <+++++> Hector. What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
You shot an eight year old girl. <+++++> Uh... yes. Apparently I did, air.
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought? <+++++> Yes no not really.
After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland. <+++++> Who the fuck cares about Cleveland. Cleveland blows. What kind of marks have they got here? Greasy mobster, teamster or some hand job politician.
Why? <+++++> Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here. <+++++> The Valley?
Yes. <+++++> Great. What do I look like a tourguide?
He deserved it. He was born deserving it. <+++++> He treats you okay?
Put the phone down and your hands up. <+++++> What? Who is this?
How long's the job? <+++++> It's a presidential appointment so... until I quit or get fired.
Animals that -- that eat straw? <+++++> Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance. <+++++> That's swell. I like you, Lloyd. I always liked you. You were always the best of them.
Saved you last night's, too. <+++++> Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died. <+++++> What are you afraid of? What people think?
Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin. My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina! <+++++> On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
They're takin' off. <+++++> Huh?
What do you want me to do? <+++++> You can get somebody else...
...One fifty-nine, Two minutes. <+++++> Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
You-you play... very well. <+++++> Oh, yeah? So do you. Oh, God, whatta-  whatta dumb thing to say, right?
If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end up hangin' on the hook, right? <+++++> Gazzo's a good man.
You can sing the song. <+++++> You know what, you are never satisfied.
Mum...  Oh Mum, God will surely strike us - <+++++> Wind - I love you with that which is endless within me. Bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice...
So, what causes this? <+++++> Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
So we have a bit of a problem, don't we? <+++++> Er well, yes we do.
I promise. <+++++> Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?
'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you? <+++++> Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know?
What about Schulz? <+++++> We'll take care of Schulz. Come on.
I don't know. <+++++> But you might.
Then you won't mind if I look around. <+++++> I would.
Yes, call me Simone. <+++++> Simone?
Well, what exactly does our platoon do? Serve beverages? Process paperwork? <+++++> Our platoon has the best assignment of all. We're the first into battle!
Time for lunch. <+++++> Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
No way. <+++++> If they're sick, great. But let's make sure. Come on, Nick.
Ask him. <+++++> Ask him yourself.
Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do? <+++++> You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
But why? <+++++> Because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne.
I never seen heat like this! Not even in Las Minas! <+++++> The water's going putrid in the barrels.
Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters. In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker. <+++++> What about O-2?
Don't be scared. This time I'm right behind you if you fall. <+++++> Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
What, as a sales rep? <+++++> A girl.
Your a nurse? <+++++> No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
Man. I'm sorry. Old man, What knight live in that castle over there? <+++++> I'm thirty-seven.
Good answer. <+++++> You?
I understand that you have political ambitions. Unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own - <+++++> I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me.
Then why you doin' it? <+++++> Seems worthwhile, doesn't it? Maybe it's just for the cave-in on Lonnegan's face when we put in the sting.
Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you. <+++++> You're not jealous, are you? You have to understand... Helen and I had this strange, intense... experience together.
Harry? <+++++> Norman, where are you?
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him. <+++++> Too late?
Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike. <+++++> I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life. It's not easy being a woman.
What are you doing there? <+++++> Hiding.
Get in the bathroom! <+++++> Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Where is she? <+++++> Takin' a bath.
I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important. <+++++> Some kids were teasing you?
Is Sunshine your real name? <+++++> Well, actually, it was the name of my drama teacher - Louis Sunshine. Perhaps you've heard of him.
I don't like it. Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments. <+++++> I'm getting treatments right here.
Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the plane! <+++++> Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close- up? <+++++> That one.
You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman. <+++++> We can do this. We can get her out of here.
He will be. In about five minutes. <+++++> Have fun.
Yes. It was, actually. <+++++> Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off?
A porco? <+++++> A pig! A pig! She's saying he's a pig.
Nothing. There was...I thought I saw something. <+++++> Is it gone?
Lately. I don't know about what. On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point. <+++++> She told you all about my details but not about his. Lovely.
I'm Mary's sister. <+++++> Lila.
Why didn't he take my life instead of hers? It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...! ! <+++++> Jeanne... calm down...! Calm down, Jeanne!
 <+++++> I know.
And they never proved anything against him. <+++++> Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Alright, c'mon Peter. We're moving you to a cell. <+++++> I signed the confession. What about the car?
I donÂt care if youÂre Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still canÂt park here. <+++++> Tell me you recognize me, Arnie. Please...
He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live. <+++++> You're living.
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public? <+++++> 
What? <+++++> It's not just the cable system. It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net. It's everywhere.
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man! <+++++> Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.
We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine. <+++++> So you gotta get him to admit on tape that he's buying this coke.
He got hit by a bus. <+++++> What does that have to do with you?
I'm working with you because of that memo... <+++++> Mission... statement...
I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information. <+++++> No, that's free. He's an architect. Used to do big high-profile projects. He scaled it all back when his wife died.
Are you hungry? <+++++> What?
I didn't know you were out. <+++++> Did it seem short to you?
Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh? <+++++> Uh-huh.
Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason. <+++++> You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince.
Yes. <+++++> that I've got to... ah... ah...
A group of us are going out tonight. <+++++> Who?
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job. <+++++> I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you? <+++++> Oh, really?
Object to the form! <+++++> It acts as a...
What kind of car do you have, Harold? <+++++> A Ford... We have a Ford.
I don't need a tuxedo. <+++++> Of course you do. A tuxedo and tails.
To join the union, you gotta get the job, but you don't get the job without the card. <+++++> What about, ah, non-union occupations?
It's suicide. <+++++> I'm just a glorified extra, Fred. I'm a dead man anyway.
 <+++++> Time out.
Expecting visitors? <+++++> No. That was the point.
Response? <+++++> Nothing. As before.
You're making my life difficult. <+++++> Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
Mammoth. <+++++> The Gazette's small huh?
You've only been playin three hours, Doyle. <+++++> I don't care. Load me a deck. Set it up for threes and nines. I'll cut it in on his deal.
He all right? <+++++> Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
Why would his worry? Or my children's worry. Or anyone's worry. Help the sit... <+++++> Sooner than later. You really need to.
Why? <+++++> They like you. Okay?
Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on? <+++++> I'm not sick.
I told you, remember? <+++++> Oh, yeah. So why aren't they doing it now?
Miles Massey. <+++++> Of Massey Myerson?
...yes, I've got that bit... <+++++> "What shall I ready?" asked Fanchon. "My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line. <+++++> You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
I look like some hoochie to you? I found it on your floor. <+++++> What are you doing in my room?
It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine. I think square rigs look so much more romantic. <+++++> Me too.
Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now. <+++++> I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
They cooked the whole thing up without asking me. <+++++> People liked him.
He was very close to me. Still is. He'll take you under his wing at Information Retrieval. You'll like it when you get there. <+++++> You're not listening, mother.
Well, what do you do? Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what? Do you, do you, do you phone them? <+++++> Leave me alone, can you? !
Tommy! <+++++> I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy. <+++++> I guess most people are.
Okay, I'm stuck. You happy? Now can you fix it, or not? <+++++> Yeah, I can fix it.
It still doesn't mean... <+++++> He said he'd prove it.
I heard. <+++++> I lost sight of everything. Forgot who my friends were.
What? <+++++> When I say I love you.
 <+++++> ...-lar.
You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you. <+++++> I'm... dying.
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears. <+++++> Are you having trouble raising the half million?
It's not? <+++++> You don't know who the fuck--
You know who this is? <+++++> Yes.
Really, I feel fine, sir. <+++++> Farewell, Concorde!
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house. <+++++> Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it. <+++++> Mr. Bialystock, not more than five minutes ago, against my better judgment, I doctored your books.
No. Not something new. <+++++> Well, something's wrong.
But I gave it to you! <+++++> Well what am I gonna do with it?
Where... where are my clothes? <+++++> Those are your clothes, silly.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you? <+++++> You don't.
Never been this close. <+++++> The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
What does that mean, Sergeant? <+++++> Cut your own throat, you're ner- vous about it, tend to hesitate.
I'm sorry about your financial problems. I really am. But they are your problems. <+++++> You're right, John. You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
Yes, sir. <+++++> You're not paid to be a canary.
Jeff--wait--they want you to speak! <+++++> Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!
What if it's true? "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on. It's the theme of my bachelor film -- <+++++> I know. I watched it. I sort of know it by heart.
Of course not! <+++++> Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
I think so. <+++++> You're bleeding pretty bad there.
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes! <+++++> City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up. <+++++> First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?
Yeah. <+++++> Where's Riccardo?
I mean, "Batman Blows It"? The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage. <+++++> I heard on TV, "Catwoman is thought to weigh 140 pounds." How do these hacks <u>sleep</u> at night?
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we... <+++++> It burnt down.
You leaving that on? <+++++> Yeah.
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something." <+++++> Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool. <+++++> That penguin last night, is he one of them?
This isn't possible... <+++++> We're going to have to do something about Marla...
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please? <+++++> I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...
And he's right over there by the way. What did you do to your face? <+++++> Someone else did it.
Seventeen minutes. <+++++> Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.
I couldn't tell you that. It would ruin the game. Not that you're playing it very well. <+++++> You like to brag, don't you?
The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell! All those people in one enclosed space... <+++++> It's like ringing the dinner bell.
Ma'am, you have to open the door. <+++++> All right.
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place. <+++++> What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place. <+++++> I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
That's some terrible shit. <+++++> Clean your mouth, or I will. Those boys had no business messing down there.
How many? <+++++> I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way.
Do you really love me or are you just saying that? <+++++> I really love you.
Hello, Sam. <+++++> Are you all right?
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right? He'll snap out of it? <+++++> I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem...
Oh, space! -- You said the right thing. <+++++> How large is your brood?
You have to come with me. It's the only way. We can give it back to you... <+++++> Keep it.
Where am I? <+++++> Jabba's palace.
Ah Steven, it is good to see you. <+++++> I only just heard of Conor. I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.
Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess. <+++++> So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
Is Billy going to be there tonight? <+++++> He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.
Look closer. Do you have anything to clean it with? <+++++> It is fine. Now, I must...
Obeah evil. I not evil. <+++++> What you then?
I can't talk just now. I'm too tired. <+++++> Where's Sartorius?
Why so? <+++++> Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
-- Flesh is weak. <+++++> -- a living, breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake.
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk. <+++++> Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
Good boy. Where's is it? <+++++> What?
What are you doing. <+++++> Feeding my fish.
What do you want? Do I know you from somewhere? <+++++> I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
I said ahhh-dam stuff. <+++++> No, you didn't say that, Brother.
You have to tell us now. <+++++> I...I...
Fine. <+++++> I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
Not my room! <+++++> What's wrong, Herman -- have you got something to hide? Then I take it there are no objections.
Thank you, sir. I was really hoping for shares, or possibly cash... but this, this is really personal. <+++++> Son, let's watch the tape.
What? <+++++> I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good.
In her dressing room? Why, what could he be doing there? <+++++> He could be playing solitaire, but I don't think so.
They don't have to feel like slaves. <+++++> Then go now--and fry with dignity-- sunnyside up.
That's what Jessica was talking about! <+++++> She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you. <+++++> But you can't.
Did you go hunting. <+++++> Yeah.
Outside. <+++++> Check him out.
Yeah? What do you do now? <+++++> I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
Who's Jacob? <+++++> My baby!
We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season... <+++++> The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
Give me one reason I can understand. <+++++> I can't write it!
They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true. <+++++> I think that's all the time we have for today.
That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster. <+++++> You are not so sure that he'll come.
Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass.... <+++++> They have no right to treat you like that. You've given them every- thing.
Ouch! <+++++> Oh!
I'm telling you now. <+++++> I gave up on you.
Where are they? <+++++> Sit down.
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and -- <+++++> What's so special about it?
I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back. <+++++> What landed you this job, pushing "pamcakes"? Punctuality? What was your area of expertise?
I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ... <+++++> Yeah? I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship." <+++++> This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure... I think.
Max, I'm scared. Are you sure? <+++++> Yes! Stay put, goddamn it! Don't move from that spot...
How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra? <+++++> Because that's where I found it. I was there.
Anybody see ya? <+++++> Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
How can anyone grow up in this circus? <+++++> You got me, Jim--but they do. Want some water?
I don't call him, I whistle. <+++++> What do you whistle?
Why not? <+++++> We'll move in Sunday.
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System. <+++++> But, sir...
And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times. <+++++> Bene.
No. I'm up. <+++++> Michael, will you do me a favor this evening? Will you stay home with Sam tonight? I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
What? <+++++> You looked right at her, baby.
To be honest, it's hard to say. I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me. <+++++> Who else can I ask around here?
Jesus, Bob. <+++++> I didn't do anything.
A elephant seal. Where's mommy? <+++++> She's, uh, sleeping.
Not a clue. <+++++> A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
Where? <+++++> To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.
Oh, shit. <+++++> EXT. ROAD - DAY.
Anything at all? <+++++> Anything at all. I presume you wonÂt want to take the boy with you when youÂre finished? ThereÂs a Â£500 fee for disposal.
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it. <+++++> We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
You follow me...? <+++++> Get on your feet, boy.
Yes. Just about here. <+++++> But there's nothing here.
You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake. <+++++> You're telling me you feel guilty.
But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight. <+++++> Sorry, old man. Work.
Eight o'clock tonight. <+++++> Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified! The power's coming back! <+++++> Shut up! You're scaring me. Stop! You're scaring me.
Captain Charles, I believe you are one of General Le Clerc's aides-de- camp. <+++++> Yes, sir, I am.
Sorry. <+++++> Yeah. That was thirty years ago anyway. L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.
Hence the radiation. <+++++> More than that. I believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region.
Just like that? <+++++> Yup. So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow -- <+++++> Wait a minute --
Fromberge...?! At the front?! No. <+++++> It is already done. I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you. <+++++> And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets! <+++++> I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
What difference does that make? <+++++> My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
Up to you. <+++++> My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore.
You come stealee tleasoo? <+++++> Oh no... Don't you understand?
Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him. <+++++> I do not.
I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die. <+++++> What?
Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good. <+++++> I've had worse.
Equipoise! Equipoise! What did I tell you, Animal? <+++++> Come on, baby! Daddy's going to buy you a hunk of cheese!
You hear trouble. <+++++> What is it?
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go. <+++++> In that case, fine. Want to see my magic trick?
Why? Why are you doing this? <+++++> Doing what? Messy up your day?
Who? Robert Taylor? ! <+++++> No! A horror movie star!
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir! <+++++> How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up. You got an injury there, Mayo?
 <+++++> Not now, Mom, please.
I read the article. <+++++> Exactly, Miss Teschmacher.
Oh, Wade. <+++++> I've been thinking about it, that's all.
Even by you? <+++++> Yes.
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise. <+++++> Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
Get a grip on yourself, Major! <+++++> It might still be worth trying Riki-Tiki- Tavi.
-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of? <+++++> Are you asking me that?
You could have a pool to cool off in. <+++++> It's a nice pool, isn't it?
Yes. <+++++> Will you say my name?
But I do have a theory... <+++++> I thought you might.
Billy, how are you? <+++++> Son of a bitch. Get over here.
Who am I? <+++++> I don't know.
I tell you one thing Trudell - you'd make a hell of a cop... <+++++> It wasn't in the cards.
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening. <+++++> So that's what? Nineteen thirty minutes...what time is it now...
Hello. <+++++> May I help you, sir?
You think you're gonna last all summer? <+++++> I'm not sure I'll last all week. I'll tell Steve.
What were we going to do if that had been the ship? We have two thirty calibre machine guns, three M16's and some handguns. <+++++> Give it a rest, Lyman.

Somebody's got to stop him, Leon. <+++++> He was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person.
Can rig it up in no time. Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water? <+++++> It's unbelievable.
I dunno. <+++++> Whaddya mean you don't know? You either got a lot or you don't. What's not to know?
That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men. Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent. <+++++> Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks... <+++++> Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
Right. <+++++> I'll take my chances with Gorignak.
C'mon, man. <+++++> You're late, not me.
I'm looking for somebody. <+++++> Who ain't?
As far as they're concerned I do. And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu. <+++++> I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
I live for a living. I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa. I've been hunting Mau Mau there. <+++++> Some kind of animal?
No, of course not. <+++++> You mean, I have your permission?
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs. <+++++> Yeah? Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh. <+++++> Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
Charlie, you're just excited. You don't realize - <+++++> I know exactly what I'm doing. Get out!
Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket? <+++++> Is that the way it was with you?
I was thankin' you, asshole! <+++++> Kiss my ass!
Come on. <+++++> Just a minute.
I'll call you. <+++++> Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't -- <+++++> Not mine, stupid. Yours.
Sure I can't interest you in anything else? <+++++> Another time.
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart. <+++++> No. Nobody will find us.
I'm wearing it. <+++++> I mean the other one!
What business? <+++++> Private.
Thank you. <+++++> You're welcome. But, I want you to do me one favor.
He took the shotgun and a light. <+++++> Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
Well, I need grass and so do you. <+++++> Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
Why? <+++++> I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
What? <+++++> The world needs dreamers. To relieve the pain of consciousness.
The... ah door's jammed. Give us a few minutes to get it fixed. <+++++> Who is this? What's your operating...
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living. <+++++> What are those mirrors for?
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation. <+++++> My client has ruled that out.
Forever. We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids. <+++++> What was he like, when he was little?
Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record! <+++++> Well, it's done now -- what's the use of grousing about it.
I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now. <+++++> For us.

Atascadero. <+++++> That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it?
What is it Miles? <+++++> I want... I want to...

Is somethin' wrong? <+++++> With what?
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse. <+++++> God....damn you, Rhodes!
Kate Reynolds... <+++++> Her assistant said you could call her at home after eight.
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me. <+++++> Well, I don't.

Nobody's asking you to. <+++++> And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
Oh-huh. <+++++> People throw stones. They call me names. I mean, really.
No sign of... Jack? Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad. <+++++> It doesn't matter.
YouÂve always got that to hide behind, donÂt you? ItÂs just business! <+++++> Yeah! For all I know, come Monday morning, weÂll go back to the real world and...and youÂll be hiring me for your best friend!
Automatic. <+++++> You got it.
Are you sure? <+++++> I'm sure. He's dead.

Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever. <+++++> Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
You mean, on a date? <+++++> Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
What are you going to do? Drink it? <+++++> Watching Norris in there... gave me the idea that maybe every part of you bastards is a whole.
And the social. How about the music notice? You got that in? <+++++> Oh, yes, it's already made up. Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life. Cal Ripken even applauded. <+++++> Highly suspect.
I'm glad you came. <+++++> Yeah, you look like you're having a swell time.
Cartwright. <+++++> 
Or was it Toronto? <+++++> Don't cut me. Come on.

I sort of already have. <+++++> Well, of course. Your old D-A-D!
Mom! <+++++> I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up.
It's happened before. Remember Lieutenant Orpheus? He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back. <+++++> Sounds like my husband. He never came back either. At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.
Kay, we weren't expecting you. You should call... <+++++> I've tried calling and writing. I want to reach Michael.
Jeanne... let him do it. One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares? <+++++> I care! And I care because God cares! All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...
What? <+++++> Coffee.
Stanley if you don't fuckin' stand up and go over there I'm gonna beat your ass -- <+++++> I'm sick of being the one, the one who always has to do everything, I don't want to be the one always --
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed. <+++++> Okay. Cottage Number Three.
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so. <+++++> What time's sundown?
I'm just talking about the Hats. <+++++> The hats.
Someone else? <+++++> Maybe you bumped into someone who took it and you didn't even know.
You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if Â well I know I sometimes run on. <+++++> Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting.
Well, I can help. <+++++> I said NO!
...the pipe tobacco. <+++++> Yes, sir. Is that all?
Goodbye! See you! <+++++> I'm not so bad.
Ouch.. <+++++> What's wrong?
Where's this coming from? <+++++> I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years. We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago...
If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense. <+++++> How do you mean?

Got a title? <+++++> Bases Loaded. There's a 4O-page outline.
Who? What are you talking about? <+++++> They're on me. They're smoking me out!
Wait. Could I have your autograph? <+++++> Sure.
...And how much is it? <+++++> Ten dollars... A month.
Any chance we can do that again? <+++++> Again? I didn't wanna do it the first time.
I... <+++++> You got to get out of here...
Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch? <+++++> Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick?
What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed? <+++++> I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less. <+++++> You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
These guys look like they'd sell their mothers. <+++++> Sometimes they do. They're river pirates. Opium runners.
Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised. <+++++> We'll see.
I don't like taking orders from Grissom. And I especially don't like taking orders from Grissom's goon. <+++++> I've considered that possibility.

Trychticholorate. <+++++> Good. -- So our two heroes, Adcox and McCaffrey, they go back inside. Only there's another fire in there nobody sees.
Will we see a worm? <+++++> Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle? <+++++> I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
Well... I'm out of the hospital. <+++++> Yeah. You said... I thought you were never getting out?
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity. All of us here may be reduced into patterns... <+++++> That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
Hi... I'm Laddie. <+++++> This is Michael.
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications. <+++++> Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college. We just go right into sheep herding.
I didn't expect -- <+++++> What the fuck is going on?
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound? <+++++> I'd love to. Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed. I hope she'll be all right, but I still think we ought to fire her. <+++++> I don't see how you can even think of it now.
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing. <+++++> Thank you, Eve.
Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics, darlin'. Where ya' from? <+++++> Gottingen. That's in Sweden.
A Miami social occasion? Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami. <+++++> Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then.
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on! <+++++> When are you going to start?
That happens. To families. <+++++> I'll be there for you.
No way! <+++++> Swear. Olaf, metal!
You are the wisest person I know. <+++++> Me! When I look around me I know I know nothing.
Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!" <+++++> You can have that one.
But I'm seeing him. <+++++> I know. I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.
Can I see your hands? <+++++> My hands?
Turn in the car. Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss. <+++++> I'll give notice.
How quickly can you move your artillery forward? <+++++> Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum. <+++++> So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought it was some foreign language.
I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you. <+++++> Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important.
 <+++++> Sir?
HARRY, would you like to share with the rest of us what's so funny? <+++++> You wouldn't get it. Just a private joke between best friends.
Do you always keep old newspapers around? <+++++> Only when they make interesting reading.
What happened to the lights? <+++++> Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.
The doctor's concerned he may never come out of this dementia. <+++++> He will. He has great faith.
Well. Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face. <+++++> When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
Oh shit... <+++++> Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
Just how easy is it to build a... device? <+++++> 
If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do? <+++++> I try not to expect you.

Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars. <+++++> Have you got your gun on now?
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote. <+++++> A vote?
But he's a policeman -- <+++++> He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?

Yes. Where you from, Harry? <+++++> California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl. <+++++> So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor? <+++++> I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
 <+++++> Oh, you would, eh? All right. If it's more important than golf, go ahead. What's on your mind?
When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal... <+++++> And then we'll arrest those greedy pigs... Is that it?
You can't kill me. I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow. <+++++> I'm not voting for you.
That wouldn't be too good, would it? <+++++> Frank would open you.
Yes. <+++++> Yaay!
 <+++++> S'only got to hold for another few days.
Who? <+++++> They're going to stop me talking to you.
 <+++++> ...we had a script conference...
I think the worst is over. <+++++> It can always get worse. You can't change what's out there, only where you're coming from.
Then it grabbed Danny by the head...  And it pulled his head right down into his chest... I couldn't... Hayes lays a hand his shoulder. <+++++> Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.
What? Oh. I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone? <+++++> I'm looking for you, actually.
That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion. <+++++> Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
That's the key to the city of Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic, uh. <+++++> Uh-huh.
Hidden camera. <+++++> Wings?
I will ask my voices... if they come back one day. Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne. <+++++> Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!
Yeah, but, buddy -- <+++++> Nobody wants a hare-brained product like this! Ya see, Buzz, it lacks the creative spark, the unalloyed genius that made, uh...
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can. <+++++> Does she know anything about this?
He's a psycho! He'll kill you! <+++++> Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
No, what's the funny thing? <+++++> I didn't even fancy her.
What is going on? <+++++> Really. I don't know.
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ? <+++++> Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up. <+++++> I don't want to go there.
Get on with it, counselor! <+++++> Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --  audience. I don't think it's fair to call my clients frauds.
Right back. <+++++> You got it. Schmuck. All right. I just bought us a few minutes. Want to get back at this prick?
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead. <+++++> I mean kiddush. Let's say kiddush. And shave my head, fuck through a sheet, all that stuff...  Come on, just for fun.
He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar? <+++++> I always get my man.
Ted, the lever! <+++++> Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it. <+++++> So you never bought any land.
You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers. <+++++> You're not funny. Ouch!
A record of the arrests... <+++++> I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.

Twice. <+++++> What did you think of him?
Look, I'm entering the draft. <+++++> You're what?
Sirrah! Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland! <+++++> You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce. <+++++> Exactly. And how long did it run?
I can't give you your damn money back on this. <+++++> Bullshit! I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
So they're Jews. . . <+++++> This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word.
Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren. <+++++> Sure.
Eeeww! <+++++> I know. I don't understand it either.
Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was. <+++++> Well, I'd like to read them.
And you'll never do it again. <+++++> And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing. <+++++> He understands me fine.
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news? <+++++> I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
Huh? <+++++> IÂm not as square as my daughter thinks.
Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary. <+++++> I was just going to!
That's what I'm not supposed to say. <+++++> Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
You came right to it, son of a bitch -- <+++++> Son of a bitch, sir.
It must be nice to always believe you know better. To think you're always the smartest person in the room. <+++++> No, it's awful. Oh my, it's awful.
All you got to do is name it. <+++++> Give Eve Harrington job in you office.
Just put it in your purse. <+++++> I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ... <+++++> I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
Do you know the people? <+++++> No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
In other words, something which your men have not been able to find as yet. <+++++> Without any doubt, sir. If anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island...
Indeed we were. <+++++> ...and my need for The Institution...
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met <+++++> You found the leopard!
Jake, this is your father's bedroom. <+++++> That's all right. He don't mind.
Could be anything. Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach. Gets sand in it. Wipes it off with a shoe. Shoe scuffs the counter. <+++++> The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated? <+++++> I don't know.
What? <+++++> That he was -- satisfied in that regard. I didn't want to pry.
We sought only your infinite wisdom. <+++++> And how did you breach the Barrier?
No. <+++++> You leave me no alternative.
You've been there before. You've seen it. <+++++> No, never!
I... <+++++> "I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like...
What did he say? <+++++> He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
What the... ?! What was that for? <+++++> Follow me.
Because it's the truth. <+++++> Let me guess. This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.
What was it? <+++++> What was what?
Out where? <+++++> Was over to Baby Suggs.
Well done, lad. <+++++> Three cheers for our champion.
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa? <+++++> It hasn't been that simple so far.
I think it's fifty-seven minutes long. <+++++> Yeah? Whatever. So did you like it?
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone? <+++++> It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
Don't lie to me. What's your name? <+++++> Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
What did you call me, Mayo? <+++++> Zack, don't!
No, Jim. <+++++> I do. If I don't get my money back...
He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much. <+++++> He loves you too.
Is she sleeping or...? <+++++> She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there.
No. <+++++> Diabetes?
Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them. Where is Captain Decker? <+++++> He's in Engineering, sir... He doesn't know.
You didn't have to get into it, baby. <+++++> Sorry about interrupting...
Mr. Van Dorn? <+++++> Mast?
Is that him? <+++++> Yeah.
Don't touch them. I feel terrible sneezing at a time like this. This is a big moment for me -- <+++++> He's allergic to everything, don't worry about it --
If you don't start telling the truth... <+++++> What do we do?
Any planets? <+++++> Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Buggered? <+++++> Every time. But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
Hi, Lloyd. This is my eighth and final call... <+++++> Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand! She could have bled to death. <+++++> But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule.
Shoot him? Like with a gun? <+++++> Yes.
They were partners. <+++++> Yes. Yes, they were partners.
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day." <+++++> Good. Perfect. I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time. <+++++> Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed?
All right, Lothat, that does it. Master safety on now until bomb run. <+++++> Master safety on.
Get some sugar too, for the coffee. <+++++> You know, I jus' can't remember when I felt so good before!
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because... <+++++> Such as what womanly things?
Choice? What kind of choice? <+++++> Whether or not you're willing to play Nancy one last time.
You're just gonna walk? <+++++> Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.
No, I'm not coming in. And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father... <+++++> We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist? <+++++> Yes.
Press still works. <+++++> It does?
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad. <+++++> Like what?
What's this? <+++++> What.
We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back. <+++++> We called everyone, did everything we could. Because of all the controversy over this island, no one will step in.
No, wait. Please. I know nothin' I say'll fix things but I want You to know it wasn't me. <+++++> No? Brothers to the bone, right?
And only then does our noble friend realize... <+++++> ...that the prey can bite back.
Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault? <+++++> Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
I promise. Is that all? <+++++> One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
What do you want from us? <+++++> Just listen.
C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that. You're a terrific mother-- <+++++> I am not! I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother. I yell at him all the time. I have no patience.
Ella. <+++++> I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
Hold lunch! <+++++> But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant! It starts at seven!
Dr. Zaius -- <+++++> Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us. <+++++> Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
Mu-shu? You're hungry? <+++++> Not Mu-shu. Mu-shu. I want to see some women. Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
Course heading, Captain? <+++++> Second star to the right - and straight on till morning...

How goes that favor I asked of you? <+++++> I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
Ten? <+++++> Sure. That's one of my numbers. It's how many months old my little girl is.
What did you do that for? <+++++> For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently. <+++++> You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over. <+++++> We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from? <+++++> I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do.
Hey, look-- <+++++> No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale.
I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira. <+++++> Certainly not. You're a mutant.
Yes. <+++++> Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right. <+++++> Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying?
Well, that's about to change big time. <+++++> He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
You listening to me? <+++++> Stop busting my balls. I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
No... <+++++> Keaton was Keyser Soze
You want the red or the white? <+++++> Pour it in your ear.
Yes. It's feeling much better now. <+++++> Good. I'm glad to hear that. ... How did you like meeting the President?
Umm. <+++++> You're looking fine, Major.
Any night. <+++++> Well, not exactly...
I addressed the Chair first, sir! <+++++> I am about to ask for a roll call on the passage of the Resolution--without further delay.
I just read somewhere -- <+++++> I know. I know. They'll say anything.
When do you deliver your project? <+++++> This afternoon.
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones? <+++++> I don't know what you mean.
We don't get many visitors. Let's take a look at it. <+++++> Send out a boarding party. Full assault gear.
Huh? <+++++> When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family. <+++++> Daddy's dead.
Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose. <+++++> Buddy, you are in one of your evil moods, I don't want to talk to you. I'm going out and sweep the patio.
...a monstrosity! Who would do that? <+++++> It's really terrible.
Ippolito! Get back here! <+++++> Like hell!
And how'd you sneak up like that? <+++++> Carefully. Don't want to get shot by you. Bad karma. Anyway, you need me.
I hope he can. I will take a little longer. I'll be as quick as I can. <+++++> What sort of time period do you have in mind? Half an hour? An hour?
Just admit you're wrong. <+++++> We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There. You happy?
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could -- <+++++> Give me the god damn mirror!
Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please. <+++++> I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
What? <+++++> I beeped you over two hours ago.
Of course. <+++++> My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
That's why you're so perfect. You have something I don't have. <+++++> What's that?
What? <+++++> Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
Whatever. <+++++> I hope you're ready for "Studs," because that's what's on.
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop. <+++++> And I'm the closest thing to it, right?
He's a very talented musician. <+++++> Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good.
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all. <+++++> Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier. <+++++> What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
To you, sir? <+++++> I intend to be there following that meeting. Report to me. One hour!
If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me. <+++++> Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10. You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.
You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry? <+++++> Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you. <+++++> I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap. <+++++> I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
Goodnight. <+++++> See ya tomorrow.
And you've got BOTH axes? <+++++> Yes, Mother.
Who is he? <+++++> Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
Guess the capital of Brazil -- <+++++> Rio, baby!
You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you... <+++++> Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door. <+++++> You never know.
Yes, it is. It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter. <+++++> Yes, it must be.
Mrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole? <+++++> The speedometer. And it was downhill there.
I know that weapon. It belonged to Juan Romeriz. He's dead? <+++++> Aye.
When's the next Jumbo? <+++++> The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
You-betcha. <+++++> My mom wanted me to have this?
Thank you, Comrade, thank you. <+++++> Bring me forty-five back.
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant. <+++++> But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
Oh, dear! Oh, dear! <+++++> You grey-haired old Judas!
Kids' game a couple galaxies over. <+++++> I guess I lost:
Who? <+++++> Wayne Gayle.
...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me. <+++++> 'Threw' you? Where?
Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door. <+++++> And gets the wind every time it opens. No, thanks. I'll take that one.
I wish you'd tell her something... I never could write letters. <+++++> What do you want me to tell her, Dave?
I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody. What's your status? <+++++> We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
I just need to talk. <+++++> You can't talk in Brownsville?
You made her a star? <+++++> I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B.
With a family? <+++++> Yes. She had a husband and a son.
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him. <+++++> Oh, yes. I remember.
I'm going first. Taking the fire. If we go out together we're all dead! <+++++> What are you talking about?
How do you figure? <+++++> According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being.
You said things would be fine, and they're not. <+++++> I'm sorry about that. Really. But --
Then why the hell do we watch all the time? <+++++> 
Yeh, he knows that. <+++++> What do you mean?
When did you decide all this? <+++++> Few days ago.
Out! Out! All of you! We have been issued with an exclusive permit - <+++++> Father ... Father!
Oui. <+++++> You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera. <+++++> Give me an ETA.
I did not; the Mouth -- that's what we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on her own. <+++++> Why should I trust you?
Do you need a break? <+++++> No.
I think now that he might... <+++++> Why?
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum. <+++++> Who do you think I am?
I have arranged transportation. We meet soon. But I think you to be disappointed. <+++++> Why's that?
Margo? Lunching in public? <+++++> It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
I thought we had separate rooms. <+++++> We do. She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
Nothing happened, Johnny. <+++++> Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.
Not fooling around. <+++++> I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
I'm busy. <+++++> With what?
It's a surprise. <+++++> Well I've got a little surprise for you.
Positive. <+++++> "Positive" you're sure I'm not fat or "positive" I'm...
I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings. <+++++> Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you?
Why not? <+++++> Great. Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . .
Well, you tried. You failed miserably, but you tried. <+++++> Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
Yeah. <+++++> What's happened is freak luck.
But you did -- I just heard it. <+++++> It wasn't me.
Because it's fair. Give me next quarter. If you still feel this way, vote your shares... <+++++> You're talking tomorrow. Today is what counts.
I know what day it is! Get off the phone. <+++++> I gotta go. I'll call you later.
Hey. It's Liz. <+++++> What's happenin'.
Hey? . You like to walk. <+++++> What?
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care? <+++++> There won't be any way to stay out of it.
Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend? <+++++> Certainly.
Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all? <+++++> And her fiancÃ©!
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life. <+++++> How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley! <+++++> S-ssssstop it!
In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres. <+++++> Jasper Lamar Crabb?
I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot? <+++++> Well, you know how those millionaires are. These came for you.
I don't think it would help much. I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up. <+++++> Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
Condition Red! <+++++> That's right. I want this flashed to all section immediately.
Boyfriend? <+++++> No.
Yes, sir ! <+++++> Who's that with you ?
Who is it from? <+++++> The American Embassy.
He's on to something bigger. <+++++> Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe. <+++++> I'm sorry, I don't think so.
So tell me, how's it going? <+++++> Oh you know. No doubts. No second thoughts. Am I a monster?
All right. I'll come for dinner. And in the meantime... you'll think about what we discussed? <+++++> In a week... we will never have had this conversation.
What is it? What's there? <+++++> It's still there!
None you'd notice. I'm lonely... <+++++> Me, too. And very erotic...
Do you like them? <+++++> I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
Huh? <+++++> I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
So, it's not a winning record. <+++++> It's not losing record.
Ken. <+++++> Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
Like what? <+++++> I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
Anything. <+++++> No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
I did not <u>last</u> with him. I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time. <+++++> I'm looking for...
They're gonna be what? <+++++> Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music. <+++++> I don't follow music much. I'd like to though. Honest.
Huh? <+++++> He shot you the other time.
 <+++++> Gazzo's gotta come to you.
Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup. Monday. <+++++> I'm leaving Sunday.
And that's the guy you have to watch out for. I hate cops... <+++++> Well I ain't a cop.
We don't need guns. <+++++> I think we might.
I don't like myself very much anyway. <+++++> Pick up your cards and let's go.
Hiya, George! <+++++> Hi, Bert.
Less than an hour. It's ruptured an air duct. <+++++> Can't we fix it?
See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust. <+++++> Mm-hm.
Tell me. <+++++> Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr. Fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.
Okay. Where to begin? With your constant absenteeism? With your unpresentable appearance? You're up for review... <+++++> I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise.
He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it. <+++++> Gill.
Right. <+++++> 
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality. <+++++> What's he got that I haven't got?
What is? <+++++> Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
Ha! The little prick ditched you! That is so goddamn funny. <+++++> Son of a bitch!
Cole, what the hell are you doing? <+++++> She's mine!
IÂm afraid I donÂt understand. <+++++> TheyÂre German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one.
Did you call the cops? <+++++> Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
 <+++++> I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
You were right, Henry. It's not enough... But it's close. <+++++> You wanta wait for your share?
Don't you think there would be a bulletin? This is a big ass drug deal! <+++++> We don't know that.
Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through. <+++++> You know who it was?
That is precisely the point of a long dining table. The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it. <+++++> I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
Bully for you. <+++++> No, bully for you.
Carl, establish contact with that deputy we met earlier. He'll be more useful now. <+++++> INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
What -- <+++++> It's not fair to you. This whole --
Oh come on. <+++++> You shut down your sensors.
All right, I'll try. See you later. <+++++> Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
You're very rude... if you don't come back -- <+++++> I'll be back in a while.
So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction? <+++++> That's correct.
Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ? <+++++> Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?
I sent her to the party. I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran. <+++++> What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book! <+++++> Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
Unfortunately what he wants is you. <+++++> So, what about you?
Is she dead? <+++++> That's the punchline. She's still alive, in stable condition.
A flack jacket. <+++++> A--flack jacket.
Just stop it. End it here. <+++++> It'll end. It'll end with him and McCay. Then the park shuts down. Permanently.
I've got to work... <+++++> Do you want me to go...?
How ya doing? Is she around? <+++++> Yeah. Honey?
Nothing came in for me yet? No calls? <+++++> Nothing.
Will you please turn back. <+++++> Get away!
Well... is it so urgent? <+++++> If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days.
No... <+++++> Before you leave, son, I'll answer your question---Susan Hunsecker is the injured party here!
No. <+++++> Whose then? Lindsey? Talk to me...
All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship. <+++++> That's the one about the albatross, right?
I feel sick. <+++++> Imagine how he feels.
And you were not hurt? <+++++> No, M'lady.
Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you. <+++++> C'mon, Tommy --
Oh, come on, Roy. <+++++> The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
Great Chief of St. Louis send me. <+++++> The District Marshall
Why? <+++++> Unsolved mystery. She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
Yeah? So? <+++++> It's odd. I don't know how Denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation.
Geneva just pulled the plug. <+++++> Kabula's out.
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing. <+++++> What do you mean?
Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me. The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture. <+++++> Really?
And the best thing of all is that she's happy. The little nut is happy, she found Mr. Right in the nick of time! <+++++> Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all.
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right. <+++++> 'Course it does.
So did we. I sent him to Franklin and Erie. <+++++> Got it.
They are clear, my Master. <+++++> Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
Oh. Why is it that you want to get into film financing? <+++++> Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill? Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money.
Yeah, I read those. <+++++> What did you think?
What are you talking about? Who? <+++++> Just some people from work...
I just want to know, that's all. <+++++> What difference does it make?
One minute! Just one minute! <+++++> Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
How do you suggest I go about it? <+++++> He's touched your heart. You're overwhelmed. You need to think it over. You'll meet him somewhere in a month.
No! <+++++> Well, if you gentlemen will excuse me, I have some pressing matters to attend to.
I've got forty-eight hours. I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened. <+++++> What about Peter?...
I think so... They're just... So ... <+++++> I know. But let's prep 'em. We could stay here all night... That wouldn't be good --
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going... <+++++> Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44. It's Son of Sam. Is it Son of Sam?
Maggie! <+++++> Where do you think she's going?
So what do you figure? <+++++> No idea.
Nothen' B. <+++++> Where you at?
What are you going to report back to Earth? <+++++> I don't know.
You've... done... this... before. <+++++> I've had some practice.
Why? <+++++> I was set up.
'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country.... <+++++> Is it?
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew? <+++++> Were you followed?
They let you pass the hat. All these kids do that. Most every place doesn't want to bother with you. <+++++> I'm not really a musician.
Then I guess you're stuck. Life sentence. No parole. <+++++> Very well. I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent. For utterly disrupting our way of life.
 <+++++> Rachel's not half my age.
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him. <+++++> Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey. <+++++> Oh, yeah. We made Sourpuss chairman and decided to call ourselves The John Doe Club. And, say, incidentally, this is my wife.
Lemme down, bugface! <+++++> That's not even close.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver? <+++++> No. that was the last one.
That's true. You grow up here? <+++++> Central High, 'n' matinees, the Bijou Theatre.
I from dat nex' place. <+++++> You wait here'n to take us? Like you bus driver to dere?
Do you believe me? <+++++> Yes.
Assault with a deadly weapon. <+++++> Listen--
I'm a salesman. <+++++> You're on the grift. Same as me.
Give me the gun. <+++++> The gun! ... I lost it
I don't think so, Captain. <+++++> Stay at it until you get fire control. Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.
I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids. <+++++> Fuck 'em. They don't know what they're missing.
What about Jaeger? <+++++> Nothing about him, unless he's got a problem about me dealing with you.
Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something? <+++++> No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
Are you calling Her? <+++++> No. Stop, come on.
WAIT!! Where are you? <+++++> I'm at the airport. Why?
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street. <+++++> Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
Sort of bad form, wouldn't you say? What was their intent? <+++++> I don't know. Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
At your mom's. She'll have a bed for you in your own room. <+++++> Where will my toys be?
Yeah, we did. It was unleaded, high octane. <+++++> So...what's the good news?
Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque? <+++++> Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.
You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad. <+++++> Go for it.
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth! <+++++> Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
Agnes, how did your mother get you? <+++++> A mistake... it was a mistake...
That wasn't the bargain. You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in-- <+++++> I'm altering the bargain. Pray I don't alter it any further.
Noooooooooooooo! <+++++> Where did you learn to shoot?
 <+++++> That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand.
We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss ... <+++++> I understand.
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all. <+++++> Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
No way... when? <+++++> Just now... I went with Seymour.
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you. <+++++> ...yeah?
So, fuck it, you wanna marry me? <+++++> What?
That's how God talks to me. If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him. <+++++> 
MacReady, that you? <+++++> Yeah!
Really? <+++++> It is an emergency, isn't it?
With what? With what, John, they took the leads... <+++++> I have the stuff from last year's...
No, I'm going. <+++++> The Shawfish?
He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills. It's right around the corner. <+++++> You lost me, Sid. Who?
You won't say that in a week. <+++++> I pray to God that in a week you're not here.
I know who he is... <+++++> He's from the Oceanographic Institute.
No. <+++++> High school?
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about? <+++++> I've read it twice, Norman. It's brilliant.
.....wait til you hear the speech tonight. The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way... <+++++> ...on the way in.
... that you don't remember getting pregnant... <+++++> Not my fault.
Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see! What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother? <+++++> The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you. <+++++> Like me?
How about art. <+++++> Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Tell us what poison you used! You can't die! Tell us the antidote! You can't let Li Mu Bai die! <+++++> She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison. It goes straight to the heart.
Hey! That's my boss! <+++++> Better yet.
Yeah. I don't see a way out of it. <+++++> Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny. <+++++> I am sure you have, no one was accusing you of being dishonest, John.
Well, who'd you get married to? <+++++> Aw, it's a long story!
No! <+++++> Why not?
Oh! You didn't read it! <+++++> Naturally I did.
Because it's illegal. <+++++> Holding hands?
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue. <+++++> Will I go crazy or something?
What are my choices? <+++++> Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
It's arranged. Tomorrow morning. Eight hundred bath. <+++++> Nice work.
That song. I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick. <+++++> What're you talking about? They love it.
Dr. Homer Wells. <+++++> I just hope he won't expect us to say *Grace* all the time.
Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. <+++++> No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
What did he buy? <+++++> I don't remember. We get a lot of people in here.
Right. Don't say my name, just listen. Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago. <+++++> Is he alive?
I mean... <+++++> Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know? You went your own way then.
Test of manhood. <+++++> You win.
Very well. But, it will only sit gathering dust. <+++++> That would be a pity. Those words might show you something you've never seen before.
I hope I didn't disturb you. <+++++> I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere. <+++++> Interesting.
I was looking forward to this evening. <+++++> I had a hotel room.
You can say that again! <+++++> I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
I'm giving him his ring back. <+++++> What?
Shrimp and fries. <+++++> I mean, what do you want? What are you doing hanging around here.
Second musketeer. <+++++> I understand you joined up in Bremen.
As long as people do that -- the country's all right. Do you understand, Martin? <+++++> Yes, sir -- I guess I do -- Gee --
No. You don't have any reason to think that... <+++++> 
You are repellant when you drink. <+++++> Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
Why the hurry, Roger? <+++++> Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow. <+++++> Oh shit. How long did it take?
He's captured Non! <+++++> Don't worry. I will draw his fire. With a few of my own.
This is Joe White. <+++++> How can I thank you? How can I repay you for this part? It's a...what a, thank you for this part.
She just likes to tease. I think she really likes you. <+++++> Great.
Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open. <+++++> A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh? <+++++> Well, nothin'.
Do you want to try your father again? <+++++> I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
No. <+++++> The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
Permission to come aboard, Captain? <+++++> Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom. <+++++> OI. I'm depressed. Leo, do me a favor. Open the safe. I want to see the money.
Dorothy! <+++++> Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
Well, haven't you got anybody else? <+++++> There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!
Me? <+++++> She really flipped over you.
Because I have no Luck! <+++++> He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand.
David? <+++++> Who's there?
You know, I think it's been five years since I saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth. <+++++> Trust me, you're not missing anything.
Just a tip. <+++++> What are we gonna do with this stuff anyway? Heroin? What the hell do you do with heroin?
It might show. <+++++> Mike wants it.
I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself? <+++++> It doesn't matter who I am. Who I am means absolutely nothing. You need to turn left here... at the traffic light.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit. <+++++> 
When did we get that? <+++++> Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on. <+++++> Like your story is over.
What? ! <+++++> They're pushing us over the cliff.
Don't be such a fraidy-cat. <+++++> Who's afraid? Besides me, I mean.
Nah, this'll be fine. <+++++> You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
Say, ain't you young Tom Joad--ol' Tom's boy? <+++++> Yeah. On my way home now.
I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you. <+++++> Oh Marge.
Yeah, I'll go. <+++++> Ok. Let's see what happens.
Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong. My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.' <+++++> I appreciate your time -
-- and this is confidential? <+++++> Of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information.
Jody, she tried to kill him. <+++++> I know.
Thanks, but I have my own now. <+++++> You went out this morning and bought a gun?
I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff. <+++++> She asleep?
What...? <+++++> I'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in love. We were just... I was just experimenting.
Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works. <+++++> Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
I didn't want to leave things the way we did. Not this time. <+++++> Wait. I want to tell you something.
You okay, man? You okay? <+++++> I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs. <+++++> Then we'll have to resort to plan B and call the v-chip organization.
Was that about the right angle? <+++++> I think so.
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere. <+++++> Praetor Shinzon. WeÂre not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
At this moment, I feel no love for you at all. I never thought that could happen, but it has. <+++++> We'll go back tonight. Bring the children.
But none of my people know how to make it. The process was carefully guarded. <+++++> Jesus, this is major. Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck -- <+++++> And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing. <+++++> Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
Bastard! If you were a true American. <+++++> Just shut up and hit me!
Uh, yeah. Guess I'm a wee bit nervous. I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports. <+++++> Fits my new image. A thief for the masses. This is one job I'm not going to feel guilty about enjoying. Gum.
Why? <+++++> 'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.
I don't know. There's a lot of space up here. They could be just about-- <+++++> Weird they didn't chase us.
Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad.... <+++++> Yes, yes, right.
This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire. <+++++> What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers.
Yeah...? <+++++> There's some weird shit here.
So WHAT?? Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay. <+++++> I'm going to my mother's.
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow. It doesn't seem to be too long. <+++++> Forty-one pages.
What is so urgent? <+++++> Come with me.
I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what! <+++++> I think something's wrong, too, Miss. But not the same thing. I think your private detective is what's wrong.
Yes, Sergeant? <+++++> Remember one thing.
No, Wade! They were real clear! They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone! <+++++> It's my money, I'll deliver it - what do they care?
 <+++++> I tell you again, I don't want any part of it. Now you take Dorothy home and...
Oh, Delia, lighten up! <+++++> She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin...
I think that you know. <+++++> Maybe...I don't...
THEN WHERE WAS IT? I'm sent out there... I'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint... <+++++> I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.
Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures. <+++++> If I were in your shoes, I'd feel the same way after what happened. The 'artificial lifeform' is a member of my crew.
What if he hears something he's not supposed to? <+++++> Well, we don't let that happen, now do we?
And I'll be a visitor. <+++++> Patients have visitors, not doctors.
Head for... for the white water. <+++++> Do you hear me, sir! If you ever fall... into British hands...  What white water?
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores? <+++++> That's your problem.
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur. <+++++> He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
Where are you going? <+++++> I'm on my way to Venice. Why?
How do you know that? <+++++> I don't know, I just feel it.
Tell the cops. <+++++> Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first.
I assume command of this ship as of  0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions. <+++++> Yes, sir.
Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle. Largest landlocked body of water on Earth. Oil-rich. Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it. <+++++> And now itÂs up for grabs, a goldrush. Far more oil than anyone thought.
I can call them... I can call my dad. <+++++> But you won't.
What do you want? <+++++> Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
She- never-spoke-another-word. <+++++> Ohhh ... dear. Not another word From the shock, yes it would be.
You have rope? <+++++> I am too old to climb down a rope.
I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose. <+++++> Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
Oh my god, what are you guys doing here? <+++++> What are you doing here, Melorra?
Claudia. <+++++> Claudia What?
Get out! <+++++> I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next. <+++++> I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
He wasn't in on it. You set him off by going to Rekall. <+++++> So why am I still alive?
It's going to be a long night. It could take hours before we know something. You should try to eat. <+++++> You sound like my mother.
I'm warning you. <+++++> A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
...Certain people are -- <+++++> Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay? <+++++> No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die.
Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way. I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person. <+++++> She can't! It's busted. Now hand that on back!
Commander Powell would have named it. <+++++> Commander Powell is dead.
You got it! Wait here while I change. <+++++> Sure.
Okay. <+++++> I'm sure you noticed that girl that was with me the other day... Good lookin' blonde? She stayed in the car?...
You know, a book. I'm calling it "Six Crises." It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write. <+++++> Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
No sir -- this is where Joel lives. <+++++> He was the bank on that shipment outta Mexico three years ago.
This cool the heat off you any? <+++++> I don't know. But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.
You sure you got ever'thing ready? <+++++> Ain't gonna be no trouble.
You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game. <+++++> You think I'm improving?
What the hell. What is this? A joke? <+++++> No joke, Lieutenant.
But if we take their money and supplies... <+++++> Exactly.
Ah... He certainly has something, sir. <+++++> Very pleased you've taken him in, David. At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
But don't be too lenient. <+++++> No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about -- <+++++> Get your hands away from the desk!
That son of a bitch. <+++++> Booth. Don't. It's nothing. It's not worth it. Remember what happened the last time?
If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements. <+++++> Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --
I see. <+++++> I suppose you don't believe me.
Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you. <+++++> Double. Double. Double.
I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if... <+++++> No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.
I can't read. <+++++> Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission!
You don't trust me. <+++++> I don't trust anyone. That's what comes of working in television.
What the hell are you doin'? <+++++> Get your clothes off.
Don't you remember? He has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up - <+++++> It did? Boy, did it ever!
Absolutely not. <+++++> No pictures, either.
I didn't kill him -- <+++++> Then who did?
They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much. <+++++> I understand.
Are you familiar with Kirshner? <+++++> Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner was in Kentucky.
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom. I thought they were going to break my arm. <+++++> I'm sorry, I...
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down. <+++++> I will not calm down!
I tried to kill my wife. <+++++> Don't you go to jail for that?
The L.A. River? <+++++> Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
I'm gonna punch you. What you want with her anyway? You in love with her? <+++++> She lives near Eddie?
No. <+++++> I can't take him to work.
What are they for? <+++++> Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets.
I'm afraid not. Terribly sorry. <+++++> Would you like a little more champagne? And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
I can't. I have too much to do. <+++++> Dad?
Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot. <+++++> Yes, sir.
If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all. <+++++> Like Valentine and Silvia?
Here's another one. They're all over the place. <+++++> They're explosive charges.
A forty-five. <+++++> It was a nine millimeter.
Ernie's? <+++++> You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
Don't tell me you really are in love? <+++++> Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization. <+++++> Okay, Major, honey. I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed.
...at least that takes Bobby Seale off the street... <+++++> Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol.
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry. <+++++> No, indeed.
Reach into my pocket. <+++++> 
Oh, here it comes. One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions -- <+++++> You want to know my idea of a marriage?
Oh Jack, what are you talking about? <+++++> Have you ever had a single moment's thought about my responsibilities? Have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers?
What? Wait -- isn't that dangerous? <+++++> How fast does it take effect?
She's doing this to get back at me <+++++> For what?
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands. <+++++> I know God help me, I know that, Eli.
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much. <+++++> Right, of course, the company...
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it? <+++++> Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once. <+++++> Are you implying you don't believe me?
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes? I-I-I am disenchanted. I am in love with someone else. <+++++> Are you?
...Well, yah. Who's this? <+++++> This is Mike Yanagita. Ya know - Mike Yanagita. Remember me?
Mmm.Hmm. <+++++> You see?
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway. <+++++> What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
I told you. Filet and salmon. <+++++> Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon? <+++++> We call that one Muad'dib.
It's too late! <+++++> Nooooo!
You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself. <+++++> I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets.
I been Q-ing you all night. How the hell did you do it? <+++++> Huh?
What's wrong with that? <+++++> I'm not sure about this.
We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex... <+++++> Worf... torpedo... now!
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it. <+++++> I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
Well, look er, I ... <+++++> What is your name, handsome knight?
Staedert? What's going on? Did you destroy it? <+++++> I'm about to, Mr. President.
You know I did baby...  And a deep, dark one at that. Now if you ain't a dog, which you don't look like -- <+++++> -- never in a million girl --
I don't know...we've gone off course or something... <+++++> What do you mean?? ?
Yeah. <+++++> I think you're lying.
Why don't you come to a commune with me? <+++++> Me? I could never go to a place like that.
You know, you got a strange line here. <+++++> It's short, huh?
What was that all about? <+++++> It's visualization therapy. He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.
Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting. <+++++> I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.
...  maybe three hours. <+++++> Caesar, what are you going to do?
Oh, well, then you better listen to him. <+++++> Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
I will. When can I come visit? <+++++> I don't know. Probably next Friday.
You do? <+++++> I only dream about people who are dead.
You are a marked man. <+++++> How so.
What man? What is it? <+++++> Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
She made it through S.E.R.E. training. Got a call this morning from -- <+++++> Not that.
What the hell's goin' on? <+++++> You gotta go back out there.
I don't know. They said we have three days. They said we have three days. <+++++> Three days.
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened. <+++++> I'm looking for Charley. I heard Charley was waiting for me. Charley?
I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas-- <+++++> And harems ... ?
No, I touched me. <+++++> Wait a minute. Do you mean... don't tell me you... in front of him.
Have you no respect for the dead? <+++++> Right now, I only wish to join them.
...Gruber's not bad. <+++++> Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right?
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation? <+++++> No. He was kidding Charlie.
You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows? <+++++> You weren't passing 'em out.
He's-he's, I guess he's fine. I don't know. He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months. <+++++> Really?
If I'm closing out this account. If he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it. <+++++> Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney? <+++++> She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
We have to stop meeting like this. <+++++> Hm?
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>. I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>. <+++++> Now, look. Claire:  Listen to me. I want to tell you a story.
I'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don't know what... <+++++> Look closely, Eve, it's time you did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm nobody's fool. Least of all - yours.
Told you I'm fine! <+++++> How many do you see?
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve. <+++++> This year? That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?
That Dave? <+++++> The things a girl has to put up with.
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write? <+++++> I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony. <+++++> But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm not interested in playing music professionally.
Her name is Gretchen. <+++++> That's a nice name. OK, let me see it.
Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he? <+++++> He certainly -- hic -- does!
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you. <+++++> All right. All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock.
What do you care? <+++++> When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right -- <+++++> The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request? <+++++> He asked to go home early. He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
That was a googly! <+++++> I know.
Who? <+++++> The groom?
No. <+++++> No. So what time do you need? I love you -- you love me -- you want to get your career going, great!
Same as they done in Mexico. <+++++> But they were Indians themselves.
Fuck me... <+++++> Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
Clever of you to find this spot, Betty. <+++++> It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe. It's only natural that peopleÂ <+++++> Well, if there's nobody holding us here, let's get going. Incidentally, my name isn't Doe. It's Willoughby.
That's what I said. <+++++> Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion. <+++++> What question?
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland. <+++++> Ostrov? I've been there. Good party town.
You weren't hired to miss him. <+++++> There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there.
Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! <+++++> I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money? <+++++> How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my... If she did steal that money...
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid. <+++++> I'm listening.
We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows. <+++++> No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here.
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost. <+++++> Perhaps.
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place. <+++++> You know what I think?
Rangers... I'm afraid you're too late. <+++++> What? !
Just fine. <+++++> We'd better see.
No? <+++++> No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
Because you always obey orders ... <+++++> Always. Except ...
I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait. <+++++> You went in the apartment?
Second chair. <+++++> Not an owner.
Had? <+++++> He was Russian. Nicholai Tachlinkov. A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.
Roy? He's always crying. <+++++> The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
You're some catch Lloyd. <+++++> Hey, you hear about the chick that came in today? Said some chick bit her at Victoria's Secret. Bitches are outta control these days.
Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you! <+++++> Oh, I'm all through talkin'. Now, let's just you an' me trip on down that hall.
Are you here? <+++++> I'm here.
Shush. Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this? <+++++> Like this. Like how? It's your fault - you're to blame. I thought it was the real thing.
She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around. <+++++> Yes, sir, sheriff.
Getting late. Guess I'll turn in. <+++++> Bundle up, Virge. Cold out there.
Why not? <+++++> Because I promised each subject that no one would look at the tape except me.
Could I have it, please. <+++++> I can't get it out. It would take hours.
He was a good ol' boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time. <+++++> I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything.
I've missed you, man ... <+++++> I know. I've missed you, too
A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank. It was robbed this morning. <+++++> Really? I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley. A crime was committed in New York City?
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece. <+++++> You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.
Do you think he loves you? <+++++> Oh, I know he does.
What about for you? <+++++> For me? I'll have the same thing.
Is the death of one species less tragic than another? <+++++> Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret.
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up. <+++++> Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
What are you saying, son? <+++++> It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir.
Yeah. It's quiet-- <+++++> I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night? <+++++> Forget it kido. We're home by eight o'clock.
She might have wanted to tell you something... <+++++> No. You don't have any reason to think that...
They lost their son. Why? <+++++> It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as ÂNever ForgetÂ.
We'll be fine. <+++++> Did you invite them?
I think no such a thing. Sal pays you, you should work. <+++++> Slavery days are over. My name ain't Kunta Kinte. Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me.
When was the last time I wore pink? <+++++> The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
Give me a cigarette. <+++++> Right now?
Who's Monsieur Philipe? <+++++> You don't know Monsieur Philipe?
Yeah, we'll find something for you. Shoveling shark shit or something. <+++++> Sharks?? ?
Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you? <+++++> Just scratched my arm, why?
The lady knows this is a dandelion. <+++++> A rose is a rose.
So you have had sex. <+++++> Yes.
Is anything wrong, sir? <+++++> What? No. Nothing.
Give him the money. <+++++> What?
Hi, Jack. Welcome to the cesspit. <+++++> Is it that bad?
Opening night? <+++++> I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
Look at those assholes, they're asking for it! Maybe people deserved to be wiped out! <+++++> Wiping cut the human race! That's a great idea!
Hiroshima. <+++++> Get your things.
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he? <+++++> I guess.
What other boat? <+++++> Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
I'm going back. <+++++> Not in that car you're not.
...Oswald? <+++++> No, I did not.
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating. <+++++> Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
No. <+++++> You didn't kill her?
But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you. <+++++> It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
Tell them to take us out. <+++++> If there's any chance --
Forget it, Scotty. <+++++> Let him talk to me, he makes Macmillan look good, I print it, the British public likes it, Macmillan owes you.
Which one is she? <+++++> The beautiful one.
I thought that was it. <+++++> So he's in the next one, Albert. I mean take it easy. I mean you're driving everybody nuts!
What are you doing? You canÂt. I... <+++++> Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brotherÂs not buried yet.
Even pigeons aren't peaceful. <+++++> One thing about them though, they're faithful. They get married just like people.
GCI. TM-1. What language are you talking? <+++++> I also PVC'd you. Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs. Four honor medals...
How'd he get it? <+++++> [Beat] I don't know.
Sarah's reconsidering. Claire, transport in five minutes. <+++++> Roger that.
Nods again. <+++++> Anybody! You understand?
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back? <+++++> Can I use your bathroom first?
Does that paper say we've been indicted? Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off? <+++++> He made his play amd he got what he wanted. They're making him a detective.
You know what I'm thinking? <+++++> What's that?
Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself. You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise... <+++++> Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back.
What medical records? <+++++> The ones in the box of files. The box of files? The one from your office?
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne. <+++++> It's all right. It's organic.
What is this? <+++++> Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right? <+++++> The Academy, then CIIAC.
You mean, again? <+++++> Well, I changed the ending a little.
There's still a way. <+++++> What do you mean?
Thanks, Principal Merkin. <+++++> I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
They saw you kill the driver. <+++++> You're up on your details, aren't you?
Me? <+++++> Yes, I could smell it on his breath, like I can on your's.
Roll the hose. <+++++> What, are you kidding? By myself?
Hi. <+++++> Hi.
Until she remarries, Fletch. <+++++> Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
I know! I fuckin' know! <+++++> You don't!
I did. We -- yeah, I know. <+++++> And threw us into the lake.
That's wonderful language. It would move a stone. <+++++> If it would only move old Miser Stevens -- We've still got to pay him.
I wanna know... <+++++> Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.
Hmmm? <+++++> Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex. <+++++> I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
So what are you doing out here? <+++++> It's colder in there.
gonna change, young lady. Now if you still got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight. <+++++> Tonight?
You're acting kind of...odd. <+++++> <i></i> In what way?
I brought you a special present. <+++++> What is it?
Are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot Jimmy Chin was not the man the cops arrested? <+++++> They g-got the wrong g-guy.
 <+++++> We live in a singular world, my friend.
No! Not again! <+++++> What are you talking about, we gotta go!
What? <+++++> That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.
You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted? <+++++> No... not like this...
Yeah, well, so? <+++++> Now I'm here. I'm in New York City. Getting picked for things. Don't you see what I'm driving at?
No. I--tell me-- <+++++> Sure.
There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ... <+++++> Sure.
What's wrong with me? <+++++> You're your own baby.
[He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.] <+++++> [Who's he?]
NPA metamorphosis should biologically slow him down. That's when we'll get him. <+++++> You can't catch this man with a computer.
I've stopped menstruating <+++++> Why do you smoke?
Yours? <+++++> You take it. I don't know.
What? <+++++> Hunt has nothing to lose now. Pardon all of them. Nobody's going to investigate a crime for which the criminals have already been pardoned.
Shut up. It's gonna work just fine, <+++++> I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
We're not going to get a ride tonight. <+++++> I can't stay on this planet.
Thank you. <+++++> If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
What?! You're calling me a stalker? <+++++> That's right -- if you weren't you would've looked for her yourself!
He's beautiful. <+++++> Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
Bobby's out .. What's the hurry? <+++++> Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.
--Good?--And then I do the one--  Oh--you don't like it, eh? <+++++> Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
Take a drink, Kid. <+++++> 
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate. <+++++> Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.
What?! ? <+++++> Each show is worse than the next.
You will not, then? <+++++> I cannot.
What did you do? <+++++> I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop.
Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me. <+++++> Oh, sure okay.
Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean. How can you pass that up? <+++++> By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.
Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need Â a fella could do worse. <+++++> Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
I've considered that. <+++++> Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
This is what we do? <+++++> I'd like you to check out this lake. See--
Yes. <+++++> They have nothing to do with this --
You will never touch her. You will never get near her. <+++++> Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
How'd you find out? <+++++> All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here. And San Diego is so much more relaxing. <+++++> Arnie, I need money. Somebody threatened my children. They want a first payment of three million dollars.
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there? <+++++> Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
I've done some really awful things in my life. Things that I've... I guess I've blocked out... <+++++> What things do you think you've done?
Where we goin'? <+++++> Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King. <+++++> They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
Okay, okay. You're right. <+++++> I know it, and it feels good. Hi, Ty.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it. <+++++> He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.
And the blade is no ordinary metal. Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it. <+++++> But I have had much practice. As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us. They'd let me play with their weapons.
My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear. Does my smoking bother you? <+++++> No, it reminds me.
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it? <+++++> Oh, nothing. He is crazy, that's all. I had a little trouble with him.
Especially my name. You must miss it every time you write a check. When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'? <+++++> This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
We're using- <+++++> You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
There was none! <+++++> What?
I need you to look at each one carefully... very carefully. Look for anything that seems strange or out of place. Anything at all. <+++++> I don't know why... why now?
What do you play? <+++++> I rock a Harmony.
It's amazing these things weren't done. <+++++> Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit... I'm sorry...  forgive me.
Huh... 500 meters? <+++++> 130... 140...
You're practically naked! <+++++> I can't wear anything under it. That would spoil the line.
Clean one in the laundry room next to your blue slacks. Hello? <+++++> Honey, this tie has a spot on it, I can't wear this today. I got a 10:30 with Chuck.
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back. <+++++> Then I have no idea.
No, Jane. <+++++> You'll be rich!
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did? <+++++> My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
I guess so...but... <+++++> You want to rest a bit before you start?
Ricky Tan is alive. <+++++> What?!? !
Thanks for the lift. <+++++> I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
How many? <+++++> You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Calm down, my lord, I beg you! <+++++> How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?! I've had enough!
Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista. <+++++> ...I don't think I know that hospital.
It's a crime. <+++++> Yes. It is a crime. A serious crime.
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences. <+++++> I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter. <+++++> "I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline."
How do I know that's her? <+++++> I'll bring her in. You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever -- <+++++> Miles -- why so angry?
Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed. <+++++> Not in those words.
Well... <+++++> We've got a cow hanging from a helicopter.
You what?.. What are you talking about? <+++++> We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship...
Three, four oxen... much wampum. <+++++> Wampum?
Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone. <+++++> Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone.
Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay. . don't hate me. <+++++> I sure don't hate you.
Not that I'm going to be much good after last night... <+++++> Eat a power bar.
Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway. <+++++> Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see anything now, it's too dark. Let's forget it.
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me. <+++++> There's no happier thought under heaven.
Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them. <+++++> Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear. <+++++> Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it?
You lame Taylor? <+++++> What?
What? <+++++> Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
What are you crying for? <+++++> I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm notÂ I'm justÂ all mixed up... .
Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater. <+++++> That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down.
Not you. A copy. <+++++> What's the difference?
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna. <+++++> No, but I'm the best.
Yes. <+++++> Egyptian Mail. Morning edition. Run!
Does she have a cell phone? A way we can contact her? <+++++> She did.
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance. <+++++> These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
I have not reached that stage of civilization. <+++++> That's all right... I grow on people.
Oh, and the sun block? <+++++> Of course.
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead. <+++++> Yeah.
Oh, please... <+++++> Danny, it's true. There were no six million. At most, two hundred thousand Jews died in the camps.
You don't have to say anything. <+++++> Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
Yeah. <+++++> All night?
It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me. <+++++> 
Don't say anything about anything. <+++++> Hi. Will I ever sing again?
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you -- <+++++> What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
Takin' care o' business, honey. <+++++> Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
He's drugged out of his mind! He's completely zoned out. <+++++> Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
I know of your fondness for antiques. <+++++> 'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate. Tell him to see me at my office. <+++++> Well, if he has a claim, we'd better see him. Send him in.
Like we're a couple. Like we're a couple and we're travelling together. That's all we're doing. <+++++> And I don't get hurt. I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
He gambles a great deal, and wins. Do you know the cards well? <+++++> Only a very little, as soldiers do.
Gotta get that chain off her, Laz. Somethin' like this gets out, you could land in a heap of trouble. <+++++> I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
 <+++++> There she is.
HavenÂt you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? IÂd have sworn you expect him to be in trouble. <+++++> You-youÂre wrong. I just called to ask if I could stay with him next time IÂm in London. ThatÂs all.
Naw, you didn't let me down. It was a long shot all the way. We gave 'em a good run at it. <+++++> Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben. <+++++> Yes, I did.
Oh -- <+++++> Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
You say Asia can be found by sailing west? <+++++> Yes, your Eminence. The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
That sounds like a curse to me. <+++++> We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ!
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon. <+++++> Huh?
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers! <+++++> We've got to stop him right here, now! With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours? That doesn't even make any sense -- <+++++> Don't tell me, partner. I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks. <+++++> Food and supplies? Who for? Like starving people?
Let's dance together -- Belle. <+++++> No, Jabez -- your place is with your wife --
Are you angry with me? <+++++> No!
Do you take German? <+++++> French.
I just don't want trouble. <+++++> He has a knife.
Well leave then. Go to Hell. <+++++> You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night?
I'm camera shy. <+++++> You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
Hello, Daryll Lee. <+++++> You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago. You read it yet.
What do you suggest? <+++++> Why, you - youÂ Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
Well... now we have to herd that thing up here. <+++++> Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full.
You know what this is? <+++++> Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
This really isn't a good time. <+++++> Come on Frida, I'm not kidding. I'm totally fucked. Let me in.
I'm going to work this week...I mean it. <+++++> It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
You forgot something... <+++++> Are we leaving?
Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both. <+++++> Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.
Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation. <+++++> This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back. What for?
Where are the bond certificates for the First Ladies? <+++++> There are no bond certificates.
No, I don't. He happens to deserve the credit. He's right here. <+++++> I'll speak to you soon
We're able to surprise each other. <+++++> In and out of bed.
A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby? <+++++> Name it.
They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up. <+++++> Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. <+++++> Sorry's no going to dry me off, you cunt.
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes. And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California. <+++++> Far out.
Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers. <+++++> You have orders, too.
They died together? <+++++> The taphonomy sure looks that way.
When did she die...? <+++++> Who is this...?
What do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water, and we might be safe from them near a lake or something? <+++++> Sounds made up.
So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now? <+++++> I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
Late Renaissance, I think. Caravaggio or Brunelleschi. <+++++> There's something very familiar about this painting.
CONTINUED <+++++> I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray. <+++++> Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting for you in the studio.
I've been asked to make sure you don't. <+++++> Oh, really. You're getting very optimistic in your old age, aren't you, Thorpey?
Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can. <+++++> Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't -- <+++++> Susan. What are you doing?
You will be contacted with the assignment. <+++++> My husband can't know about this.
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities. <+++++> If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now. <+++++> I didn't know.
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig -- <+++++> I couldn't face her if I had slept with somebody else.
You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed. You hear me? I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...? <+++++> Yes. I hear you.
What do you mean? <+++++> Her hands. Like that.
Murder. <+++++> Ah, yes. The murder.
You're rich. What do you have to worry about? <+++++> Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars.
Seriously? <+++++> Seriously.
I hope we will, too. <+++++> What?
Gimme ten bucks. <+++++> Ten dollars.
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway... <+++++> Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
What? What? What, Jim: I tell you what, let's get out of here...let's go get a drink. <+++++> She told me not to talk to you.
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate. <+++++> I am... On Gina. Fuck Â I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
Goin' to see my kid. <+++++> I didn't know you had one.
Good, because it cost enough. There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it. <+++++> I intend to.
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street. <+++++> Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
You'd like the house. <+++++> YOU'D like my room.
Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes. <+++++> Mr. Thomerson, I...
Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces. None of them knew that; <+++++> What else did you keep out of the papers?
I have been... I think you're right. <+++++> About what?
I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy... <+++++> Not at all. You're light as a feather.
Not exactly? But close enough, eh? So he saved your life, then? <+++++> How did you know?
You mind me asking: why the fuck? <+++++> The, uh, blur there.
Com'on, tell me. <+++++> Well, a boy goes like this, see.
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment. <+++++> To get on home.
I'd put you there myself. <+++++> Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
Stella -- in economics, a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market. Absolutely none. <+++++> It crashed, didn't it?
A monster. I know, I know. <+++++> You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
To keep from being an old maid. <+++++> You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me. <+++++> I don't understand you.
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy? <+++++> Larry, you've got to tell her.
I need you to trust me. <+++++> Why do you need that?
You all right? <+++++> Why'd.. .you pull me out?
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us. <+++++> Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives. <+++++> I'm too old for you.
There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons. <+++++> That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger. <+++++> That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
I think I'm losing you. <+++++> No wait, don't go!
David Ferrie. <+++++> No. I have never known anyone by that name. Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
What? <+++++> You're everything a guy could want.
What's that? <+++++> All right, Vader's boss...
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be. <+++++> So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
We were lovers. <+++++> How long were you together?
Can I ask <u>you</u> something? <+++++> Go ahead.
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark? <+++++> Of course not!
What ya doin' out so late? Hidin' from the cops? <+++++> I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer. I come by to help you carry out your money.
With a man in my head... <+++++> Yeah.
She figured it out. I'm sorry if that upsets you. <+++++> No, that's fine. She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.
It's okay. There's no microphone. You're no fun. <+++++> No, I'm not.
Well, it seemed to me -- <+++++> You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way.
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much... <+++++> Yeah, maybe...
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I-- <+++++> Great. Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
Parker. <+++++> Sir?
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i> <+++++> <i>                      Three of a kind...</i>
Good for you. Go find out. <+++++> Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
Oh my God... I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes... <+++++> Mr. Kovic. We're not here about your taxes.
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday. <+++++> Really? You think so?
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here... <+++++> He's so close. Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
Bobby, you're in way over your head. <+++++> Go to 'em, Jerry.
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just... <+++++> Just what?
It's okay, he just wanted his machete. <+++++> Three...two...one...
Sorry. I'm better with men. <+++++> Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
Only you. <+++++> You're wasting time.
Under a hundred. <+++++> You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
I have a bad feeling about this. <+++++> About the plane? What do you think itÂs gonna crash? DonÂt say that...
I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you. <+++++> We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
No, no. That won't do. <+++++> I told you, something's upset them.
I'll be back within the hour. Now, <+++++> It's going to be fine. It's going to be ... you remember in 88, when...
Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17  Peter, that jacket is foul. Lose your glasses? <+++++> Hi, Adele.
I can use a smart guy like you. <+++++> Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking toÂ
If there's a way in, there must be a way out. <+++++> No, that's not true---there's well...no--
No? <+++++> No.
Oh that one there, in the corner. <+++++> The one up on the third floor?
...Yes. <+++++> What do you do, with the money you earn?
I need to touch it to "see"... <+++++> See what? ?
All I've ever seen is Black folks. So since we spend much money here, we do have some say. <+++++> You a troublemaker?
Who are you talking to? <+++++> To you! You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
So? <+++++> 
Tonight. Let's get together. <+++++> Okay.
Some crazy guy. <+++++> But he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair.
We'd better light some of those lamps. <+++++> No... wait. Hold me.
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me? <+++++> I don't believe you had a mother.
Everything's fine, pop. <+++++> Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly. <+++++> There's no place like this place. Warm climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't nothin' like this no-damn-where!
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way? <+++++> Would you? Actually, you could.
She deserves our loyalty and protection. And yet you spoil her lands, poison her oceans, blacken her skies. You're killing her. <+++++> Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat. No coolants to preserve food. Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
...and I think I know why. <+++++> Why?
The right man? Talk to me, Ray. <+++++> Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands.
They left. I had to go with them. <+++++> Why didn't you tell me?
Beautiful, intelligent eyes that have no business in "Frank's Fun Palace" or anybody else's Fun Palace for that matter.. <+++++> Uh. "Thanks?"
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right? Bit egotistical, isn't it? <+++++> A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
Well I never did it. <+++++> There's nothing to it.
How nice. <+++++> In time she'll be what you are.
And me too, son! You shore done got to be such a big little man! <+++++> We goin' huntin' again, Daddy ! ?
I better go over and see her. <+++++> Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old womanÂa trip like this.
I am strong, Paul, like a lion. <+++++> I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something. <+++++> I just remember you jogging. So when's the wedding?
Johnny. SUPERNOVA. <+++++> But all these people...
Is Johnny here? <+++++> He's coming.
That's too bad. Ian's got a good thing going over there. <+++++> Yeah?
I can't got tonight. I don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight. <+++++> I'll be with you.
You can't just walk in here and walk out, you sonufabitch! I'm gonna tear you a new asshole! <+++++> You broke my nose!
I kept looking back, like you taught me. I didn't see anyone. <+++++> Okay. It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now. If I get a signal... I may have to leave suddenly.
But, mom! <+++++> Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
Auto wreck. <+++++> Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
Was there Burger King? <+++++> Uh, uh. There was no such a thing as Burger King.
Luck be with you, Sam. SamÂ? <+++++> It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
If my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning. <+++++> Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here. So --
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy. <+++++> But you're going through with it?
...Not even a 'thank you'? <+++++> Well -- I think you might consider
And what did he say? <+++++> He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me.
Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ... <+++++> ... you have to sack me. I understand, sir. I'll go quietly. In fact I'll go right now.
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you. <+++++> Go head on, breaker.
Sarah listen to me. <+++++> Go away.
This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot. <+++++> Sure. Thanks.
Faith, we know about Jeriko. Iris made me a copy of the tape. <+++++> Oh God, Lenny. I was trying to keep you out of this.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither. <+++++> You getting into bed to think about yellow?
In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass. Frank. Dean. Sammy. Right at ringside. <+++++> Enough jabber.
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro? <+++++> What did I say?
First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself? <+++++> Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
We'll figure it out. <+++++> Figure it out?!?! I'll be insane before I figure it out.
Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls. <+++++> Yeah.
That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite. <+++++> Hmm.
You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever. <+++++> Then...
What is it you thought you saw on that tape? <+++++> Still working on it.
Thank you. <+++++> Don't mention it... Pleased to be of service any time.
That's not the way to win him back... not Leon. <+++++> I think I know Leon quite as well as you... possibly a little better. Leave that worry to me.
How long will this take? <+++++> 'Bout thirty seconds.
I don't want to hear this. <+++++> Skirt just came off.
Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life. <+++++> That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.
Are you still in love with me? <+++++> Jesus. I do not know. I'll talk to you later.
There ain't. <+++++> Then what do I do?
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people. <+++++> I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Oh? <+++++> I guess you have to go on faith.
JosÃ© Yero changed-up the drop plan on us. He's grabbed Gina. <+++++> Where's the new drop point...?
Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard. <+++++> Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me. <+++++> What?
What're you doing here anyway? <+++++> Coffee and a donut.
Thank you, sir. <+++++> 
But what if we leave them behind? <+++++> Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.
Of course. <+++++> It was just an idea.
What do you want for free? <+++++> You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who? <+++++> Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives.
Charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late - <+++++> Too late for what? Too late for you and this -  this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me?
You did, didn't you? <+++++> Don't do this.
One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp. That came with her. <+++++> And the child...
Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way? <+++++> North. Keep going North!
Is he dead? <+++++> Yeah.
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ? <+++++> Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
And for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what you are. 'Cause of what you have and he hasn't. <+++++> Would you get off my back, Sarah? Once and for all, will you get out, will you GET OFF MY BACK? !
You got him too scared to peep, Sheriff. Maybe if you put that gun up-- <+++++> You telling me what to do, Roderick?
Oh, right. <+++++> Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
Eddie! You scared the hell out of me! <+++++> What if I was Vince? You'd be dead right now. What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
That's what I like. <+++++> Which thing?
It's me. <+++++> Nick?
It could have been an accident.... <+++++> It was no accident....
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder. <+++++> Remind me to tell you about when I looked into the heart of an artichoke.
Didn't I say that? <+++++> Yes and no ...
Dinner... and what else? <+++++> Just dinner.
He's not as tough as he'd like to think. <+++++> Neither are we.
Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell. <+++++> So you're our own private guy?
Nice doing business with you, George. <+++++> Not bad for a weekend's work, huh?
She took care of the dealers... <+++++> Hey, Mitch.
This is his room... isn't it? <+++++> Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
I got half. <+++++> Makin' trouble for someone?
That doesn't seem so bad. <+++++> But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
Why not? <+++++> It's humiliating.
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical... <+++++> Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
This isn't music! <+++++> It is to us! It's computerised.
Then, you should call. <+++++> What?
You all right? <+++++> Fine. Never felt better in my life. See, I'm a good liar.
Now, that's American music. <+++++> Yes, I know this song.
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing. <+++++> No --
There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation? <+++++> The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.
I'm all finished. Now what? <+++++> Burn it to a fine ash.
I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home. <+++++> Why not?
What? <+++++> You just come in on Amtrack?
C'mon, Mommy. Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done. From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present. <+++++> Peerless, last time, go see your father.
Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D. <+++++> Th.D. ?
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won. <+++++> So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
The one I got they wouldn't let me read. It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon." <+++++> I won't tell you what came between... I'll prove it. It will take a long time, Ninotchka... at least a lifetime.
Eileen, Chinese food again? <+++++> George, if you don't want Chinese food, pick a place you want to go and make a reservation.
Saw what? <+++++> When dad died, I saw another fire...
Headshots. Girls to play the girl in our footage. I like the sorrowful one. Anybody Else....? <+++++> ...what is this?
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though. You think it's Charley Wade, huh? <+++++> Forensics people are sure of it. You have any idea who might have put him there?
Are you still a virgin? <+++++> Maybe yes. Maybe no.
Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four? <+++++> Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler. <+++++> Brian.
I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that? <+++++> How would I know? You gotta tell a person these things  A hustler?
This new one, today... washed up here. Elk River, in West Virginia, about six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies. <+++++> There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?
You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin! <+++++> Brody's this way.
My lord. <+++++> I have spoken with your father.
There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her. <+++++> No, there isn't. There's nothing to her.
Would you? Would you...? Or you're gonna what, fire me? <+++++> It's not impossible.
And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay? <+++++> Okay.
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat? <+++++> Yes.
They have stolen state property. <+++++> What a nerve!
That's not <+++++> I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
You need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you -- <+++++> Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after. <+++++> Did you actually give Williams that gun?
Yeah? <+++++> Are you a lawyer?
Watch me. <+++++> No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that, Stanley...
He calls it the Tarantula. <+++++> But it only has six legs.
That building? <+++++> Gonna be le hot shit. Pardon my Francais. Dance club. The Resurrection Brothers play there. Heard of them?
Speck. Harold Speck. <+++++> From the grave?
Thank you. I'll tell Simone you liked it. <+++++> I'd love to tell her myself. When are you going to let me meet her?
I told you I've never driven before! <+++++> Never drive again!
I'm still not clear on Chaos. <+++++> It simply deals with unpredictability in complex systems. It's only principle is the Butterfly Effect.
I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this. <+++++> Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
What's free about it? I'm looking for work. <+++++> What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
You guys know my cousin Mikey Sullivan? <+++++> Yeah.
You got a comb? <+++++> Don't need a comb.
Oh, Jesus H. Christ! <+++++> Are we on "Cops" again?
No heart to burn. <+++++> Everybody has a heart - except some people. Of course I've got bicarb. There's a box in the pantry.
Do you love her? <+++++> A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts. She's my idea of nothing!
Go inside. I'll be right there. <+++++> What are you gonna do?
We was just leavin', fellows. <+++++> Let's go, Jocko. The man's got homework.
What?! ! <+++++> I gotta go back.
I want you to know I'm sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse, I thought of someone hard and impersonal. <+++++> I love Fort Holland.
I'm not sure I'll be able to...I... <+++++> <u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country. <+++++> Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy. <+++++> Sorry, King.
What? <+++++> Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --
There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico. <+++++> But not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt.
All your friends call you Jazz. <+++++> Exactly.
Who was just here? <+++++> Iris, man. Pay attention.
That is what we shall do. Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable. But so was his decision to engage in piracy. <+++++> Commodore, please!
He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top. <+++++> You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
He was just here! <+++++> He was here. You fell asleep. We took him. You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.
Oh, not that. You promised you'd burn it. <+++++> You were adorable. The least you could do is use a glass.
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE -- <+++++> WHAT? ?
I saw him too... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie... <+++++> What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets. <+++++> You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
That's just exactly how they spell it up there on that big building, bet you could see it from here. M-O-N-Y. <+++++> Okay. Never argue with a man.
Anytime, sport. <+++++> Yeah, thanks pal.
It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting. <+++++> Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
Did you work with him, Keith? <+++++> At the Half Moon.
 <+++++> You know what he is talking about here?
You gave it to the girls for one. <+++++> Hey, they blew me.
But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here. <+++++> Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos?
It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside. <+++++> I ain't wearing no gun.
Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days. <+++++> A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree.
And then you killed him, right? <+++++> I let him go... believe me.
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything. Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money. <+++++> I was well compensated.
On top of him? <+++++> He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
 <+++++> ...I always thought so...
Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat? <+++++> They must've hit something.
I love a macho faÃ§ade. It's such a turn-on. What smells like shoe polish? <+++++> And you came here to what? To comfort me?
Then there is nothing. <+++++> Perhaps...
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement? <+++++> Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!
If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in? <+++++> If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
Yeah... I seen him around. High- roller dude named Strader. Joshua Strader. Runs a club on the west side. Encounters. <+++++> Yeah, I heard of it.
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't... <+++++> You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
Women will want to get to know you... <+++++> I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me? <+++++> Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
Write that down. <+++++> Okay, what else?
You out to buy a motel? <+++++> No.
Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious. <+++++> The doctor? Was the doctor here?
Let me try. <+++++> You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard. <+++++> Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have... <+++++> NO!
What's the matter? <+++++> He likes you.
Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas? <+++++> Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
I know you? <+++++> Name's Otis.
Oh. And that is -- mom? <+++++> Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space. <+++++> Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself. Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
- Inauguration balls - <+++++> - opening of the Opera -
I couldn't say. But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now. <+++++> Yes -- that's true.
Clyde, you wait here. Glenn, got a minute? <+++++> I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
Call me sentimental. <+++++> Remember the first time we came up here?
A change of plans? <+++++> Yes. We won't be able to have dinner tonight. Something's come up. I hope you don't mind.
I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand. <+++++> Watch that. Watch that tone.
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life! <+++++> Spend my days beheading country bumpkins? I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you?
You're going to have to explain that one. <+++++> He doesn't have one.
Shut up. <+++++> Does it hurt?
 <+++++> I'm sorry Walt -- it's gone beyond that.
What do you want from me? <+++++> I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
What? <+++++> On occasion for security purposes, to double for the President at the Secret Service hires someone public functions and exposed situations.
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you. <+++++> Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
All damn. <+++++> Just hold your breath.
Watsa matter with you? That's no way. Now you get married. <+++++> Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
I'll probably go back to it someday. <+++++> Uh-huh.
That's where he'll be. <+++++> What?
How about rapacious and love- starved? <+++++> No.
Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis. <+++++> That's great.
Can you walk? Puedes caminar? <+++++> She say she in great pain.
Jasper Lamar Crabb? <+++++> Know him?
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit. <+++++> Maybe it's time for a vacation.
Wolfi! <+++++> What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
Food! ! <+++++> I'm sorry, sir. We only seat by reservation.
NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK THIS THING OUT! <+++++> Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett.
Good luck. You're going to use up all your help vouchers. <+++++> Help vouchers?
Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits. <+++++> You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
Between six and seven seconds. <+++++> The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.
If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring. It wouldn't be tiring at all. <+++++> Why not?
It's nice to meet you. My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name. <+++++> Oh... um, William.
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio. <+++++> Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
It's not opinion. <+++++> You're just absolutely right and I'm absolutely wrong?
Do you? <+++++> It's been a while since...
That's your monkey, Denham. <+++++> Kong ...
Are you marked like this? ? <+++++> Why?
I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea. How does it feel to be dead? <+++++> It's a lot more stressful than I thought.
I don't care to bargain. <+++++> That insults them.
Yes, I thought that. <+++++> Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
I thought you'd think it was crazy. <+++++> IT IS CRAZY!
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that? <+++++> That's a book, baby. That's a book of love.
Just come and get it...right here! <+++++> DON'T, come on!! !
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight. <+++++> Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent... <+++++> ...off. Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...
All right, we'll take Jeff with us-- <+++++> I'm afraid we won't have room in the car, Father. Senator Smith can follow with Mr. McGann and the pigeons.
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt." <+++++> "Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at... <+++++> My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks... Yes!
See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it? <+++++> It sure is.
We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for? <+++++> Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
...-son. Of all the days for you to show up late. First, the idiot April calls in sick. Then I got a bad tooth... <+++++> ...and then my night man shows up when he feels like...
That's Lednov! We come along here. <+++++> And meet him there.
I know. But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things. <+++++> Right, of course. I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
Why'd she kill herself? <+++++> Yes.
In the kitchen. <+++++> I'll make some for us.
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain? <+++++> I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
...please, I just don't want it.... <+++++> ....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
I thought you were done? <+++++> One last tweak.
So? <+++++> I never trust a woman who's not blonde. Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart.
 <+++++> You, you don't under...
How is he - ? <+++++> It was moderate. He'll be all right. But it was out of the question, his coming along.
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry. <+++++> Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
Would you know this store again? <+++++> Sure. Why?
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir <+++++> Thank you
That was long ago. You're only the woman who keeps care of me. I know you. <+++++> Look at me.
When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean! <+++++> Go out and find her!
See if mine are in there. <+++++> Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Not anymore, Mr. O'Brien. The nanobot has changed that. <+++++> If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
... And the new stereo. <+++++> I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying. <+++++> That's right.
Car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... Where did you find these kids? <+++++> They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.
The suspense is killing me. <+++++> Harry called.
Oh, my heavens! It's gone! <+++++> Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
... I understand ... <+++++> ... But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson ... and they called him  up and said to come out. He's a good man.
You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie.... <+++++> Hey!
You said never to touch you before a fight. <+++++> If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
Well, I think you should be realistic. Ya can't start an ad agency on fifty dollars! <+++++> What are you doing? Give that back!
She says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months. <+++++> She told you that? Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that.
I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um... <+++++> Why did she do that, Jim?
Just thinking about something. <+++++> What?
Just the two of us. No dolphins, no sharks, no whales, no penguins. Just you and me. <+++++> Sounds wonderful.
Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know? <+++++> I'm going to bed.
And maybe you lie... <+++++> In that case you won't find her -- and I won't get my thousand dollars.
Skipper, you're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is. <+++++> Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of them soon.
Yes ma'am. <+++++> I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
Those women are happy. And we can get even better. We can wake this place up. <+++++> Out of the question.
My dream. <+++++> How you plan to do that?
Should you be drinking in your condition? <+++++> Oh, David, stop being a nanny.
Tired. <+++++> Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
He doesn't look very threatening. <+++++> That's what I said to my son. He said, there's always two kinds.
 <+++++> Where does that name come from?
She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago. Her name is Fin Raziel. <+++++> You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
It was alive? <+++++> Yes sir. Right then it was.
I thought he was going somewhere but now I think I am wasting my time. <+++++> No, you guys are great together. He'll come through, I'm sure.
No. <+++++> Am I getting warm?
We're closed. Come back in the morning. <+++++> It is morning.
Blocked. <+++++> Ah. I don't believe in writer's block.
What about the President? <+++++> He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he?
No, but I heard it was great. <+++++> Oh, thanks. Thanks.
Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that... <+++++> Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
You have to come. <+++++> What's with you? What do you care whether I come or not?
 <+++++> So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker.
South Central. <+++++> How long, you figure?
Anything in it? <+++++> Money.
Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have? <+++++> Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
He's good. <+++++> You haven't seen anything yet.
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur. <+++++> One has to be more than "careful" of Mrs. Goodhall--she has sufficient Christian zeal to start her own country!
Oh yes, he's pretty good. <+++++> What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
Charlie M? <+++++> Charlie M.
You go set down by the River. <+++++> Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed. Keep tension on the warp. Is that clear? <+++++> Just about. Show me again.
Shut it up! Shut the little bastard up! <+++++> Chuck him out the door! Like a little hors d'oeuvre.
Oh, I suppose you could do better. <+++++> Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take? <+++++> Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother.
Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others. <+++++> Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls?
So they travel around from place to place and preach? <+++++> We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs.
Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week. <+++++> You're not going to take your *suit* off!
Gibarian warned me. He left me a message. <+++++> Who was it?
You can't have the whole brain! <+++++> So far, you have four and I only have two!
This is Drake Bishop. <+++++> <i>Mr. Bishop... this is Claremont Williams. I own the Williams Brothers armored car service.</i>
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different. <+++++> So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
Just a few bucks. <+++++> And Myra's stuff?
I hope you understand. <+++++> Hey, bad throat, huh J-man?
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date. <+++++> A date. What, are you a hooker? What do you mean a date? I've got a wife back home.
I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ... <+++++> Re-runs?
Are you...okay? <+++++> It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
When he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed... and I want it to bleed for me. <+++++> Kill a dead guy?
Why not? <+++++> No one broke into this room, sir. Someone broke out. That lock was torn off from the <u>inside</u>.
George, I'm sorry. We all know the army will acquit Arnold... <+++++> Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.
If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then -- <+++++> That's terrific, but there's one problem:  we don't have the means to receive all the data on our own.
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally. <+++++> Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
Yeah? So? <+++++> Now look at him...
Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence. <+++++> And you think he could find out her number for me?
No. <+++++> Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
We're goosed! Goosed by God! <+++++> Micheal get a grip. What did you tell her?
Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty. <+++++> But this is absurd!
Where can we talk? <+++++> Right here.
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here. <+++++> We can always do that, Duff.
I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy. <+++++> Come on--let's take a swim.
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission. <+++++> All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner.
...without compunction. <+++++> Well, well, well.
Oh, well, here -- let me help you. <+++++> Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind.
Nothing comes. <+++++> Most interesting.
What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going? <+++++> I'm leaving, man. I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
It doesn't matter. <+++++> No. I want to know.
Yeah. <+++++> But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life.
I was wrong. <+++++> Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you? <+++++> Why should I mind?
You think Tran killed her? <+++++> The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
Yes -- <+++++> So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
I know. <+++++> You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha. <+++++> only yes and no...  You're a bit.
Now what's wrong? <+++++> I've completely lost their signal.
Let you leave without it. <+++++> Without what?
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor. <+++++> Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today. Do Nestor tomorrow.
Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth... <+++++> Hey! You want good stuff, or you want shit?
Oh Mom... <+++++> Can we watch that scene again? You know, where he rips out her heart? PLEEEASE?
I knew you would. <+++++> New worlds create new people.
How's school? <+++++> I left last year.
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour? <+++++> M'hm.
Is everything okay? <+++++> You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
It's gone now. <+++++> Oh, Jesse...
Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now. Maybe you don't appreciate that. <+++++> I don't care, Philip. You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead. Just watch out for those buck teeth.
Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it? <+++++> I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
I want a second opinion. <+++++> <u>This is an operations desk</u>.
It's unbelievable that you can do that. <+++++> It - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself. Like I'm fading away-
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface. <+++++> What do we know about the population?
That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be marriedÂ <+++++> Don't pay any attention to her.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago. <+++++> I'm trying to help.
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there. <+++++> It's only one picture deal.
We don't know what else to do. We need results. <+++++> You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
I don't accept that. <+++++> Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
But he ain't seen my heat-- <+++++> Awright, meat, give him your heat.
It would be fantastic. <+++++> But Dad'll never go for it.
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody. <+++++> I felt that you could do better for yourself--
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time? <+++++> It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!
We had an off night, that's all. <+++++> So when are we gonna have an on night?
Ugh! <+++++> Seventy-two clients. ONE stayed. Jacket on, tie in pocket. _ 44.
Nothing could get him away from that two mule town. He coulda been big over here -- he could of had his own Family. <+++++> You're right.
What are you doing? You're going to kill us! <+++++> No. If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me. But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.
It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed. <+++++> Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
I'm the coach! <+++++> I just started!
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death! <+++++> Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department? <+++++> Yes, Dudley. I am.
You talk as if he were a gigoloÂor something. <+++++> Never mindÂI'll get it myself. Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
Well. <+++++> I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.
What? <+++++> Come here -
Rose, what are you doing up? <+++++> Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you... <+++++> The moon is too round of face, methinks.
What's she willing to give us? <+++++> She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.
What have you ordered? <+++++> It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told.
I think you're the liar. <+++++> I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.
The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite. Do you have an appointment? <+++++> What are you talking about?
Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule. <+++++> My greatness is better demonstrated with this.
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments. <+++++> I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
That's not really a very proper question. <+++++> How old are you?
I guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty. <+++++> Unbearable, I'd imagine.
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there. Why not use that? <+++++> It was dead. We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
The world is just one kiss-ass game after another. A man has to make up his own life, alone. <+++++> Ah. A philosopher.
Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding. <+++++> Where do we go?! Where do we go from here??! !
This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through. <+++++> What do you get if you finish?
Made by YOU, Loki! <+++++> By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...
You want me to contact Starfleet? <+++++> Is there a problem?
What's this? <+++++> Now don't you go monk'ing--
What can we do' mate? <+++++> Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.
What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive. <+++++> Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
There are so many beautiful women here. <+++++> It's unbelievable.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon. D'you understand that? <+++++> No.
What for? <+++++> You can't ask me that! Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted. Not what I wanted it for. I want money.
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack. <+++++> I know. We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
You know better than that. <+++++> We don't know of anything, Master...
Remember you asked me what state I was from? <+++++> Yes.
Recommend we proceede, Captain. <+++++> Mr. Decker... ?
You're mine, you know. I made you. <+++++> I know.
What? <+++++> I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
Made what? <+++++> Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.
That sounds like their problem. <+++++> I'll be right there.
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone. <+++++> Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. Â­- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING! !
Why? <+++++> After your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny.
Can't you stay with us a little? <+++++> I am busy inside.
You saying the Democrats bugged themselves? <+++++> The FBI thinks it's possible--the Democrats need a campaign issue, corruption's always a good one.
Yeah. <+++++> If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble.
It's okay, it's okay. What's the matter? Tina? Honey? Hey --- <+++++> No! It's still there!
...-lar. <+++++> This isn't some kind of pissing contest, Long. You may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsi-...
You don't reckon I'd leave you. <+++++> Don't you believe me?
What is that? What are you doing? <+++++> What?
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it? <+++++> Right.
The locks? <+++++> To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
Spooks? <+++++> Intelligence work.
For all I know, you're the rat. <+++++> Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
You mean like in the steam room? <+++++> That's not fair!
You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out. <+++++> It's not funny at all. One can't get intimate just off hand.
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that. I'm taking control of the team. <+++++> What? !
I have no idea. <+++++> I wasn't asking.
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars? <+++++> Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
Look at Him go. Bam! Bam! <+++++> Knock it off, Luke! You cain't talk about Him that way.
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers. <+++++> Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
Accept a compliment. <+++++> I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
China. <+++++> When's he coming back...?
I don't mean braze. <+++++> I didn't say braze.
What? ? <+++++> The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here? <+++++> Yes.
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case. <+++++> You heard?
What? <+++++> Starting up.
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie. <+++++> I've already lost it.
You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you? <+++++> I've never LOVED anybody!
AmyÂs not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker? Is it ÂdrunkerÂ or Âdrunker-erÂ? <+++++> Just drunk enough.
He dissed us AGAIN, Brandon! <+++++> He probably... Has some very important business to attend to...
Yes, that is correct. <+++++> Why?
Kathy Price... <+++++> Yes...
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up. <+++++> But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
Yeah, and I'm gonna start by getting on my feet. Working on things from inside the system. <+++++> Inside ain't in the system. It's right there inside you!! I'm joining up.
The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses. <+++++> At least one.
The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me. <+++++> I decided it this morning.
Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag. <+++++> Wouldn't surprise me none.
Jonah! <+++++> Okay.
That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not -- <+++++> FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk. <+++++> That sounds so depressing.
Fatter... some things never change. <+++++> Boring.
Bring her home... I guess. <+++++> No more violence... No more violence...
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing? <+++++> Who?
Let me in, Pike! I'm hungry! <+++++> Get away from here.
I wish you had said something to me about staying here -- <+++++> It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for?
No, I'm alone. <+++++> It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?
There, there, lie quiet now. You just had a bad dream. <+++++> No --
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me! <+++++> So what do we do?
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here. <+++++> Thank you.
What? <+++++> Who got their heads cut?
No. <+++++> In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return. Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage. Do not attempt discussion. Am I understood? <+++++> I got it.
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared. <+++++> Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
Karl, what are you doing here? Come in. <+++++> I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
Oh, my God! <+++++> Where are you hurt, son?
Why not? <+++++> Shut up. I'm not listening.
What did I say about mentioning that bitch? <+++++> Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
I think you do. <+++++> You say that like a gentleman.
Yeah, watch the road! <+++++> You'll total the whole car.
Business. <+++++> Won't your father help you with that?
What did I say? <+++++> Will you GO, damn you?
Peugot convertible ... <+++++> What color?
And what am I supposed to say to the man? <+++++> The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me. <+++++> They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
You know how I feel about her. <+++++> You've mentioned it about fifty times.
I waited up till midnight. <+++++> You weren't waiting for me.
You? Leading a squad? <+++++> Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
Eleven. <+++++> Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather. <+++++> What else, my dear Major?
You and I, we've started... something, you know? I don't know what'll happen if you do this. <+++++> Me neither.
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been? <+++++> Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes. <+++++> Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot-- <+++++> --it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you? <+++++> Ah-hh, no.
Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea? <+++++> Yes.
-- even if I give you a million as well? <+++++> Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is now... <+++++> I'll see you soon --
Oh, thank you, Amy. <+++++> You can open it now, I guess. Lois Huggins says that's proper,
Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative. <+++++> I told her all my relatives are good- looking.
Why? <+++++> To ski?
Can you tell us what's on the disc? <+++++> ) There is one program with approximately 1.3 million lines of programming. It is thoroughly secured, which is not surprising considering Lindenmeyer created it.
I know the feeling. <+++++> Well, you know, you know, that's a lie, I, I...
Lao She. <+++++> Nee chin lie how ma?
All right- let's go into battle. I'm Redbeard. <+++++> Somehow I guessed.
A float! <+++++> That's it. Build him a float for the Thanksgiving Day parade!
Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation. I don't know what you're talking about. <+++++> Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought. That's news.
He passed away. <+++++> I'm sorry.
Who was that? <+++++> Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
I don't think I'm cleared for this. <+++++> I'm certainly not.
My staff tells me it's been mostly drug pushers... I said that can't be the same Edward Dowd. <+++++> It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.
A little modesty would suit you better. <+++++> Who is on this committee?
You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK? <+++++> Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here. <+++++> I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here. I'm cooperating...
All right with me, I used to drive a taxi. <+++++> Let's go.
I'll stay out of your way. I won't interfere. <+++++> I'm sure you won't. But you're going to have to wait till we come up. Then you can film all you want.
I can't leave. <+++++> You get off on abuse or something?
Christ. Is that an axe? <+++++> Yep.
Jes? Jesse? Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP! <+++++> Stop what?
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much. <+++++> I'm okay. I just -  You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid.
I'll speak to someone. <+++++> And you'd better speak to someone too ... or find yourself another client!! This smells like a set-up to me!
Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me. <+++++> It's going to Sonora.
No one. But I'm a little nervous. <+++++> When can you get it here?
Why not? <+++++> Well, first of all, it's entomologist.
This cannot be. <+++++> It is. Do not ask me how. I do not know.
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us? <+++++> What taxi driver?
All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time. <+++++> Is it true?
Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation. <+++++> My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
Don't worry. I don't wear it at the dinner table. <+++++> No matter how often I see guns, I still can't get used to them.
I love you, Conner. <+++++> Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
Yeah Jimmy? <+++++> How much of that story is true?
But that doesn't add, does it. <+++++> No it doesn't.
"Madam!" <+++++> By and by I come to cease thy strife and leave me to my grief. A thousand times good night!"
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog? <+++++> Sure.
Please? I'm dyin' of thirst in here. <+++++> Good. How long will it take?
Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me. <+++++> For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?
Hmmm? <+++++> After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Why am I here, Mr. Hadden? <+++++> The infamous, unfashionable bluntness. You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.
Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere. <+++++> You have to move on, Sid.
Love. Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry. Love women, and they will love you. Love yourself, and -- <+++++> That is enough! You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
 <+++++> ...sounds dubious Chuck, but Piping Rock any day.
 <+++++> So?
I was just... <+++++> Who asked you?
In thirty-five minutes. <+++++> Christ!
Washed away. <+++++> One more out.
Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely. <+++++> Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything. Wouldn't I, darling?
And it's a big reward. It's a big reward. For one night's work. But it's got to be tonight. <+++++> What?
I like it. I like it. I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative. <+++++> That's okay, Daddy.
 <+++++> HUH?
That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden. <+++++> In that case, I suppose we can't charge.
My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us. <+++++> Just be glad you're all right.
Oh, yes. <+++++> And then...
No, I want to walk. <+++++> Come here. Come on, now.
When it comes. <+++++> When it comes? What'd you tell him?
They're cancelling all leaves, all passes. No more drills. We stand at full ready starting-- <+++++> What's your point, Wes? You have a point?
He's got that kinda money? <+++++> It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem.
It's a machine gun. I thought I'd kill myself. <+++++> Are you lovesick?
...and that is what you need to expand. <+++++> I don't understand.
You look great. <+++++> Thanks.
May I help you? <+++++> I -- what are you? !
Someone recommend you? <+++++> In a way.
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish. <+++++> That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet.
Mocky-Lock. <+++++> Oh no... No you don't.
Ricky. <+++++> Soho Grand, right?
You don't have a choice. <+++++> Mom...please.
The Federal Building was too well guarded. <+++++> No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices.
No, this hurts. <+++++> YAAAAAAAA !
No? <+++++> Gillis, get this through your head. I'm not just your agent. It's not the ten per cent. I'm your friend.
I thought they were your friends? <+++++> Were, Doss <u>were</u>.
Toothache. <+++++> Hmm!
They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you. Dad wants to talk to you. <+++++> Hi.
What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy? <+++++> Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
Yeah! Here's a name. This is somebody's personal tax -- <+++++> Who is it?
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun? <+++++> We'll have more fun in Detroit.
You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you. <+++++> But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
Did he just say what I think he said? <+++++> I've got a clue. Look at my ring. Before my old lady ran off to Baja, she told me my dad had this same ring.
Please, sir!--come with me! <+++++> No, Jeff--please--!
Hot or cold. <+++++> Cold.
Don't! <+++++> Stop paddling!
What's the point? <+++++> It's been two days. You should call that girl Nikki...
Yeah. <+++++> My old man split along time ago. It doesn't mean anything. You just take care of number one that's all that matters.
Ha! That's for fucking sure. <+++++> What else you got?
 <+++++> Oh my god, Jim. Jim, that was so --
Casual? You were boning her weren't you? <+++++> It wasn't serious. What's your problem?
No. <+++++> Well, it's Carter. That's my name,  And her father was my brother. And he was murdered last Sunday.
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale. <+++++> The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean. <+++++> Are you offering me a bribe?
I hate to ask about a window. <+++++> I flushed it down the toilet.
Are you worried? <+++++> Should I be?
I'm getting paid... <+++++> ...peanuts.
Well, life's not fair. We know that. <+++++> It's all relative. I need the money too.
Well, it was just an idea -- I hate to see a ticket go to waste -- <+++++> What time does the show go on?
I'll say whatever I want -- <+++++> YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
What you got me up here for? <+++++> Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person.
He understands and accepts my feelings for you... <+++++> Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.
My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President  I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu. <+++++> Just Klaatu.
Well...What are we doing? <+++++> You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
No, I don't. <+++++> Yes, you do.
Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up? <+++++> Quite so. Quite.
Hi. Good. <+++++> I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark. <+++++> What could cause them? What's in the Core?
Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question? <+++++> Certainly, Bill.
If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you. <+++++> "The world breaks everyone, and afterwards many are strong in the broken places." Ernest Hemingway.
Who else is here? <+++++> My father.
Conscience... . I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts. <+++++> Good luck.
Where is Jacqueline Gibson? <+++++> What a peculiar question.
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat. <+++++> Only if something happens to me.
I knew you'd come. <+++++> Newt, I want you to hang on, now. Hang on tight.
You ought to go home and take care of thatÂ <+++++> First things first.
Where are you? <+++++> We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies? <+++++> You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved.
...what...? <+++++> I have money to give you.
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is? <+++++> This is different.
Yes. <+++++> Jesus!
The way to a boy's heart is through his ego. What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal? <+++++> Inspired, Ms. Ivy.

It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch. <+++++> Why are they after <u>me</u>?
How? <+++++> I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him. So cold and distant. I've let him make her like that. <+++++> Why tell me this?
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey? <+++++> No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.

But they have. <+++++> Well, don't go.
Did you find him attractive? <+++++> What do you mean, like physically?
Hey, have you seen Benny lately? <+++++> No...  You want me to give him a message?
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting! <+++++> What do you mean, not enough time?
Welsh. <+++++> Sean Connery.
No way... <+++++> Think! Can we stop it?! Block it up?! Shut down the line somewhere?! Think!
YouÂre funny. <+++++> Yeah, but I feel like crap. And if you feel like crap, itÂs way better to look hot while youÂre doing it.
I beg your pardon? <+++++> I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
Around here. <+++++> the valley?
Smooth move, hot-shot. <+++++> What was I supposed to do?
Maybe it's the wrong ship. <+++++> Shut up!
Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British? <+++++> It comes down to leaders.
Right. <+++++> Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
Are you kidding? He'd kill me! <+++++> Then you're playing a part for him too, aren't you? A dangerously self- destructive one.
Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered. <+++++> I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
My leg is falling asleep. <+++++> It's not falling asleep. You've only been standing there for three minutes.
Who's? <+++++> Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school.
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible. <+++++> He didn't leave with them.
You will die! It will be awful! <+++++> Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols? <+++++> I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
You don't look so good. <+++++> I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
Where are you taking me? <+++++> South America.
It's a sun dress. <+++++> It looks like a tablecloth.
Uh-huh? <+++++> Uh ... Hi! Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
Thanks. You know something, Jake? <+++++> What's that, Curly?
Of course! We must do it! It's the will of God! What is it? <+++++> We must... get you some experience. We must... leave this place.
What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks. <+++++> I got it. I just don't got it on me.
Well, do we just go on up? ! <+++++> No, son! We wait for night. Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.
What kind of talk is that? So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now. <+++++> My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business. Bring a friend. I've plenty of room. <+++++> I'll try and make it.
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development. <+++++> Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .

And it's <u>my</u> call. I promised them water-skiing, instead o... <+++++> Our weekend. At that sweet little B &amp; B.
You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know! <+++++> "You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's call the whole thing off...Hold it!
I never thought I'd say "I'm just in this job for the money." Sad. Any last immature quips? <+++++> No. But why do you let Butterfinger keep those blood stains on his shirt?
She's real eat, drink and be merry girl. <+++++> And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
There's a test, you know. <+++++> Forget it, Judy.
What about my keys? <+++++> You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ.
Got work. I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him. <+++++> You a sailor man? That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.
Okay... <+++++> ...here comes the...
...Ten minutes. <+++++> Ten minutes for ten dollars.
 <+++++> No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
There are two bodies found at this point. <+++++> Can we go up to the crime scene?
Is he all right? <+++++> I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
Okay? <+++++> Superb.
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground -- <+++++> Don't take cold, Jabez. Come -- it's warm in here.
You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em? <+++++> No.
No... before that. <+++++> Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small... I should have never come back here after college.
There you go, Mr. Brubaker. Suite 610 in the East Wing. <+++++> May I use your pen?
They don't notice that kind of thing. <+++++> So what's the point?
You've lost your mind. <+++++> We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
Her name is Henriette... <+++++> What I want to know is sir:  where is your daddy?
It's my birthday. <+++++> Happy birthday.
Half. Okay? Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic. <+++++> Seventy-five dollars, and a ride. Okay.
Seven days?! Seven days?! Oh, great. Oh good - - clever. <+++++> That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together. John's plan.
Who's gonna outfit us? <+++++> Outfit? What's he talking about?
Get out. <+++++> But this is my apartment.
My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it? <+++++> Must have been tickled pink.
I'm...scared. <+++++> Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this.
I seem to remember knocking on your door. <+++++> And, I remember breaking your nose. You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
This is not the time for squabbling. <+++++> Sorry.
Where is your daughter? She might be able to give us some information. <+++++> She's at school. We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
I did? <+++++> I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
 <+++++> She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...
You're a damn kid. You ain't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time. <+++++> I get nervous, that's all I know.
What does this guy want? <+++++> He'd like to kill me.
Not black. <+++++> No, I'm Haitian-Puerto Rican.
It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg -- <+++++> Beg -- beg of you! You crawling graveyard rat!
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some. <+++++> Man, get outa my face. I ain't nobody's punk.
You didn't kill her? <+++++> The time wasn't right.
You got some nerve. <+++++> What do you mean?
Whatever it is. Most of the roses die behind the bar. This is the first I've given out for nearly a month. <+++++> No. Really?
Damn right, but where the hell were you? <+++++> What are you talking about?
In Edmunds' things. <+++++> You went through Edmunds' things?
He called me chicken. <+++++> And your folks didn't understand?
Can I take you to lunch? <+++++> No..I have to get back to work. Take care of yourself.
Goddamit! Where is he getting the money to fight? <+++++> Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
How old are you? <+++++> I'm eleven and a half.
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector. <+++++> There must be-- but when I'm with you I can't find it.
Well, if it's a discharge -- <+++++> It's not a discharge. Right, Edmunds? You said before, right? So it's gotta be a message.
I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy. <+++++> Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
Who is the boss? <+++++> I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
Yeah, I was there. <+++++> You swear?
His grades are hurting, Charlie. <+++++> Then you can help him.
Well... <+++++> You wanna ride in my truck?
 <+++++> Do you have any pictures if her?
Forget it, it'll never work. <+++++> Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.
Some kind of animal? <+++++> The pelt is black. It's a kind of man.
He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you "our beautiful daughter" in the letters she wrote to him. <+++++> From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there. Take the others to the water tower for the night. <+++++> I'll be bait alone?
So where's the best place for mojitas? <+++++> Bodeguita del Medio. It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze... <+++++> But that's Sweet-face -- your own good horse.
Could you get this? I can't <+++++> Sure.
Mike, take it easy... <+++++> Take it easy! I set her up. I saw it coming.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest. <+++++> Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
They not together, sir. We don't see him in a long time now. <+++++> Do you hear from him, son?
Sam, we got a problem. <+++++> What is it?
 <+++++> What about the Cromwells?
A question of who rides who. <+++++> If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
What was this for? <+++++> For bravery.
It's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original... <+++++> Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.
Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills... <+++++> How about a passive radiation scan?
I'm a good friend of hers. <+++++> How do I know you're not lying.
No, sir. <+++++> Right. The mothballs, Mister.
No I don't. <+++++> I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class. <+++++> I wasn't there. Like I was some kind of pedigreed dog or a horse. Like I was invisible.
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand? <+++++> But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
Where's your gun, your pistol? <+++++> In my bag, in the car.
You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you. <+++++> That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that.
Don't you realize what you are dealing with? He's Vigo! You are like the buzzing of flies to him. <+++++> Oh, Johnny. Did you back the wrong horse.
This morning was good. <+++++> The hat business is in trouble.
"Music for Old People." What does that mean? <+++++> Look, I'm sorry about this, but I'd like "the Upsetter" by Lee "Scratch" Perry, in there.
No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother. <+++++> STEPHANIE?
What do you say? <+++++> Not interested.
You wanted to see me sir? <+++++> Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine. <+++++> I did too!
You'll back me up with some paperwork? Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself? <+++++> She doesn't know what we're up to. And we can't afford to let her find out.
Not now, Sven... <+++++> I must KILL! Kill!
This party is for you and Bob. Get your mind off the reporter. <+++++> I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
It's not? <+++++> You gotta push the little yellow button...
Or mud carriers. <+++++> And there's no shame to that. It's all the same here. Everyone has an important job to do.
Goddam right. <+++++> Yes.
Jesus! <+++++> You know, statistically that's the second most common word people say right before they die. Shit being number one.
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday. <+++++> Jesus.
Hospital. <+++++> We can't do that, dude --
Wait a minute. <+++++> Is anything wrong?
Are you all right...? <+++++> I...
Whoever tossed this place wants you. And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire. <+++++> How's this about me?
What? <+++++> I'll come with you.
What do you do if something happens? <+++++> Get mom.
Where are you moving to? <+++++> I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.
No, surprise, I thought you'd be-- <+++++> What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
I like you, Maude. <+++++> I like you, Harold. Come, I'll teach you to waltz.
Fine, I just -- <+++++> And I appreciate that impulse.
What mind? If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this. <+++++> I talked you into this?
I'm not gonna make it. <+++++> Shit.
 <+++++> Ah ...
Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world. Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill? <+++++> Don't worry.
The time...is short. <+++++> For what!? !
Foreman now. <+++++> No shit.
You're not kidnapping her, are you? <+++++> What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you? Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed!
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub... <+++++> ... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart. So what the hell's the connection?
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here? <+++++> Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
Just one. Why is this floor so short? <+++++> Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you. But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.
Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style. Whattya say? Should we start on the paperwork? <+++++> Let me think about it. Hold it a day for me?
Jesus, Jaeger. <+++++> I don't see how that plan's any better.
How long? <+++++> Five minutes. Maybe six.
Well, there's no use in sending it. See that--I saved you seven twenty! <+++++> Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it? <+++++> Yes...
Are you familiar with "Heaven?" <+++++> I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
 <+++++> Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
How long have I been out? <+++++> Almost two days.
Did he kill Freddie? <+++++> Marge, when did you get here?
Shit! He jumped! <+++++> Jumped where?
You wanted it turned off. There's no such thing as a good fire. People get burned up. They can't breathe. <+++++> That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body. <+++++> They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.
The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never. My husband... his heart broke when Mary left... <+++++> I didn't mean to...
I meant me, my son and my daughter. <+++++> Open the door. I'm coming aboard.
Daddy, come up and sing the baseball. <+++++> I'll be up soon, Little Chief.
I'll kiss the baby for you. <+++++> I love you.
Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in. <+++++> What do we have to do?
 <+++++> They didn't look like medical files to me.
San Francisco. <+++++> How'd you happen to come here?
We all did. <+++++> Where did he get it? Was there any of it on the ship?
I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere. <+++++> She's around. Always is.
In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again. <+++++> You're so negative.
What are you going to say? <+++++> You do the talking. Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
I don't know. But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility. <+++++> And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose.
And hey, I appreciate it... <+++++> Where's my father? Have you even looked?
Not for me. <+++++> Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
Did you talk to him? <+++++> Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes. He isn't to consort with his computer friends.
I should get back. <+++++> Pilar--
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too. <+++++> Chicken blood on the crops.
Nice to meet you? <+++++> Peace out, Craig.
It's not your time. I get time off. <+++++> You get time off to sleep.
We must have been heroic. <+++++> Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
He killed a man worked for him the other night. <+++++> So what are you trying to tell me? I should get out of here?
No. I haven't seen any. <+++++> A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
A friend of mine offered me a job here. <+++++> Where are you staying?
He's the only cat left that still grooves me. <+++++> Heil, baby! I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
You'd lie to protect him. <+++++> Probably.
Haven't heard a bird sing in days... <+++++> Or a kite...! We could make a kite... Let the wind do the work --
I don't know - I'm American. <+++++> So?
Um... did you still want to read my novel? <+++++> Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.
I'll tell you one thing though. <+++++> What's that?
Then get out and close it behind you. <+++++> You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy.
What happened? <+++++> I didn't get the bet down in time.
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps. <+++++> I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them.
It was you, Charley... . <+++++> OkayÂ I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, butÂ go ahead, blow.
How about a month from today? <+++++> Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know. <+++++> I told you she was innocent.
Jesus! I don't <u>believe</u> this! <+++++> You're hung up again.
I can't ... <+++++> You must. Luke, look at me!
What you been up to? <+++++> Nothing.
We drugged her. So she wouldn't remember. <+++++> Try harder.
No? What's he playin' here? Put the gloves on! Let's see who's gonna tease who now! <+++++> Let it go, don't waste your time.
And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place. <+++++> But it's not true.
Three legs. <+++++> That's too many.
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country... <+++++> ...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
I thought that was only for bombs. <+++++> No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
I was not. <+++++> Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
I'm not going to be drawn into this. <+++++> I know this sounds crazy. I understand. Check your parents' blood types. Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
It's not his job -- It's my job! <+++++> Bob...
You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said... <+++++> Wait.
You have something, Dr. Weir? <+++++> The date.
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get? <+++++> It'll be more than enough. We can get out of here...
Blood and guts. <+++++> We'd better get back downstairs ASAP.
No! <+++++> It's not suffering anymore.
What proper grounds? You can't be in love with me. You hardly know me. I'm not in love with you. <+++++> I know that.
Sure. <+++++> I don't mean a little favor. mean a big F favor.
Take the rope. <+++++> Enough's enough. How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
Victims of what? <+++++> Something bad happened here, Murphy.
Want a ride? <+++++> I'm all right.
Nowhere. I don't have class until second period. <+++++> Even tried you at home. We've got a situation here.
It's true. I can't live without you. <+++++> "And this too shall pass away."
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her? <+++++> Not really. She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.
If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him. <+++++> I'd slap his face.
The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog? <+++++> Oh, yeah. So we split it. You know, as in Âshare.Â People do that.
Good morning, Jennifer. <+++++> Morning, Doctor Goldman.
Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep. <+++++> Then you better do something to				* jumpstart that man's motor. You know... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion.
Can I take your coats? <+++++> Sure.
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys. <+++++> So it's an honor?
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one. <+++++> Photos?
Doesn't cover everything. <+++++> Good excuse. How many others you got?
Okay. I give you my word. Is ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you all right? <+++++> Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.
"You might think what I've done is shocking..." <+++++> "To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."
Curious. There's something missing. <+++++> The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her. <+++++> Naw.
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now. <+++++> Oh, yes, it's Thursday. Hello, Rose, dear...  ... my, you're... looking pretty...
Sir, your transmission's fading. <+++++> What the hell are you talking about?
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things? <+++++> No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
You plan to drink both those beers? <+++++> Sorry.
...so I, so I like that. I always like an underconfident person... <+++++> That's really nice!
They blame you for the compromise. <+++++> And they want me to make up for it.
Do you want to do bad things? Anything. anything. <+++++> What do you want?
You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy. But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment. <+++++> 
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us... <+++++> This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster? <+++++> Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
I had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once, sued me before I could bat an eyelash. <+++++> I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
Oh. Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy. <+++++> Mm.
A little family emergency -- <+++++> I hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other. <+++++> Yeah!... Anyway, I don't like hotels. Too much people, everyone's got the key... I don't like it.
I'll stop by. <+++++> Please call first.
I think so. <+++++> Show me.
Okay, does anybody here know what's going on? <+++++> Yeah, I know what's going on. We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood!
Schnapps... <+++++> Peppermint... alright.
He's alright. <+++++> How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy. <+++++> What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey.
He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth. <+++++> Let me earn my keep. I'll go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot.
I'm tired of running. <+++++> Oh, you won't be running for long...
That's what I said! <+++++> But - what can we accomplish?
Someone died here. It's tapu. <+++++> But we came down this way didn't we? I'm sure we did.
But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over. I'm unarmed and I'm coming in. <+++++> No, you're not! I don't trust any of you!
Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that. <+++++> Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated.
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call. <+++++> Oh great. Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
Liberating isn't it? <+++++> Y'know it is, a bit.
Go ahead. <+++++> You don't understand. This is my niece Vera.
Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information. <+++++> If we told you -- we'd have to kill you.
That's right. It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions. <+++++> Show me just Agatha's data stream.
But what about that math project? <+++++> Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there! <+++++> I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
Yeah. <+++++> It's like...
I'm not going! <+++++> You don't have a choice.
No wonder he let her go. <+++++> Really.
Day. Wednesday. <+++++> Last?
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here? <+++++> I must have made a mistake.
I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey. I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would... <+++++> Treat you like a mutant? We are not what you think. Not all of us.
How many trips did you make? <+++++> With ten thousand? Nine.
Where are we? <+++++> Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
Actually, I don't know... <+++++> Oh shit!
What? <+++++> Stop now.
You've done well by yourself. <+++++> I get by.
I don't think so. You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News. <+++++> My parents don't read the Daily News. All right, if you think I shouldn't. I can't believe the things the papers are printing.
And? <+++++> Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it. <+++++> And so you feel nothing.
Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g... <+++++> Uh, let's go sit down.
Stand back. <+++++> Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
I'm looking for my friends. <+++++> See, I heard you were looking for some guy with a scar. How's that going? You find him? Yes? No?
When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear? <+++++> Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something... <+++++> That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait. <+++++> Thank you.
Jesus. What kind of FBI agent are you? <+++++> I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare.
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything. <+++++> They don't know this.
You want the Spencer, Bill? <+++++> Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.
But what is this -- why? <+++++> The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up.
Oh, no. No. I'm just finishing up here, and I've got to get home. <+++++> Why don't you guys go sit down, okay? I'll catch up in a minute?
You can't print that! <+++++> He grins wolfishly.
Died there? How? <+++++> How the hell should I know?
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy. <+++++> Where's Turley?
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then? <+++++> Scobie was able to travel, but Carson Dyle was clearly dying, so they --
Not many things you can count on for sure. <+++++> I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.
I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers... <+++++> Then where do we go? !
You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town. <+++++> What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler!
X21. Come back. <+++++> Ray. What's your 20?
It's Madison Fra-- <+++++> STOP IT!
A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money. That's what I did. <+++++> Yeah?
What? <+++++> The costumes. Am I right?
What? <+++++> Meet again, sometime.
You will? <+++++> If that's what you want. Yes.
We'd love to hear it. <+++++> 
Yes, but no one is in control of their emotions. that's all we have time for today... <+++++> I don't understand.
What do we do about those three? <+++++> We got morphine, don't we.
How does it taste? <+++++> Just the way I remembered.
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there? <+++++> You pull me up.
You're not interested in sex? <+++++> You mean coitus?
This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve. <+++++> Still, fifty cents ain't bad.
I bought a beer. That was two- fifty. I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty. <+++++> I'm sorry, sir. It's thirty dollars for the ticket.
Halden, how nice to hear your voice. <+++++> What do you want?
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years. <+++++> No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
Did he? That's more than we get to do. <+++++> Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
What? <+++++> Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll-- <+++++> Two-hundred.
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur? <+++++> Jacques!
Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard. <+++++> The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much. But it is going to change.
Why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in? <+++++> I don't plan on dying.
Right here's fine. <+++++> Is that the woman from..?
Jesus. <+++++> She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.
We're not going anywhere. <+++++> But they don't know about the translation! They could be in danger right now.
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know. <+++++> I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ? <+++++> Yeah.
Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all. <+++++> But what becomes of our souls?
And where'd you go? <+++++> To the Riviera.
Edward Rama? <+++++> Eduardo. Rama.
That's what the Kurgan said. <+++++> The Kurgan was a pussy.
Now. <+++++> Okay. And what do you love? Say everything.
Lots must a died, too. <+++++> Well, we ain't out a it yet.
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan. I like your style. <+++++> What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech. <+++++> I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
Now, wait a second -- <+++++> You sent them to that ship. I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
Wesley... <+++++> "It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
Why'd they break off? Was there water in that canyon? <+++++> Huh...? No...no water.
It's all right. I don't like it, but it's over now. <+++++> I never had anything before, Epps. I never was anybody. Not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins.
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic. <+++++> He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
Well, what's the point of waiting? <+++++> I agree.
No accents today. <+++++> Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act. Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard.
Well, I held it like an egg. <+++++> An' he scrambled the son of a bitch. Having fun yet?
You look good in a dress. <+++++> You would have looked better.
What the fuck are you doing here? <+++++> Looking for you. I tried the hotel.
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world. <+++++> Have you got what I want?
Well, I'll be--!! ! <+++++> What's the matter?
Aren't we ... <+++++> No, we're not!
Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched. <+++++> You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager? <+++++> We have a business manager. The best around.
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris. <+++++> No, no, no, no. We must leave.
...Jimmy... <+++++> I really don't know.
What kind of crap is that?? ? <+++++> Jus' playin' the game, sucker...
Well, I'll be darned. And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do? <+++++> Go out with DIFFERENT girls!
There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin. <+++++> I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
What was <u>that</u>? <+++++> <u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor. <+++++> No way!
We still have to go? <+++++> Yeah.
Help me! <+++++> I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power.
Would that make you any happier? <+++++> Much happier.
Jeffrey! ! <+++++> Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time. <+++++> Really?
I will never forgive you. <+++++> I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
Yes, M'sieu Laval? <+++++> Madame has changed her mind. She'll be down in a minute.
The civilian does not. <+++++> The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
 <+++++> Someday she'll thank you.
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written. <+++++> That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head? <+++++> If there was, I didn't see it...
Come on. You can't be serious. <+++++> There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and lifeÂstyles.
No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy - <+++++> You're driving me nuts!
--chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents. It's called vandalism. <+++++> What is <u>this</u>?
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank. <+++++> It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
Neither will I. <+++++> I think I'm ready for the Show.
But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now? <+++++> What if he did?
How is it any different? <+++++> It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment.
No. They're beyond that! They're smarter than the humans. What's <u>more</u> advanced? <+++++> Dynamite --
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology? <+++++> -- Eddie told you?
Do you think that's a good idea? <+++++> Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him. <+++++> Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
It's a stunt. Humans don't write. <+++++> Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over... <+++++> You slept here all night?
Don't hold me so tight. <+++++> Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
Mary, Honey. I talked too much, like always -- he thinks you told Elaine the things I told her. <+++++> I don't care what he thinks.
I look familiar? <+++++> No. What house you work?
Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater. <+++++> I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job. <+++++> But what is this?
Don't worry, Mr. Baker. We'll knock him out. He won't feel a thing. <+++++> I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point. <+++++> He what?
This is it. <+++++> Where's Ricky.
I got word from Wynant this morning... <+++++> So did we. I mean, Sherlock here.
Yes, yes-- <+++++> Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course--
Quit kidding. You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it. <+++++> You and who else?
Hello. <+++++> Jacob Singer?
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir. <+++++> Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
Don't mention it. <+++++> I guess I owe you my life.
Yeah. <+++++> Well it sure looks dead enough.
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them. <+++++> Yeah, but what about--
Almost done. <+++++> Ow!
I must KILL! Kill! <+++++> It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here! <+++++> Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.
Where have you been? <+++++> Taking my pleasure. Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
Will it lower the curve? <+++++> I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.
Oh, don't be silly. <+++++> Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
 <+++++> Sorry.
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud. <+++++> It's a winner Mr. Mannheim, trust me -- buy.
You okay? <+++++> Yeah. How'd you do.
Yes. <+++++> What do you feel?
...uh huh... <+++++> 
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose. <+++++> Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
Well, aren't you going to invite me? <+++++> You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
Dad, you're not taking this seriously. <+++++> This is not how you do it. You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
Damn it! <+++++> Hi, baby.
Your parents are always going away for the weekend. You're so lucky. <+++++> Yeah, I guess.
Yes. <+++++> Anything?
Born and bred. <+++++> Lucky for you. Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place.
Sergeant? We thought you were... <+++++> Yeah, yeah. Well, what have you got to say for yourself?
No, I'm fine. I'm...  ... wonderful. Just walking down the street with you again. <+++++> We took a walk three days ago.
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it? <+++++> Yeah, what?
See? You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time? <+++++> I'm sorry, Ike. This is permanent.
Shut up. Here's to a great week. <+++++> Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she? Doesn't she? <+++++> I don't think we can do that.
There are forces at work here you don't understand; I can help you up to a point, but only up to a point. <+++++> Are you threatening me?
What? <+++++> The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis.
When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf! <+++++> Madmartigan! You saved her life!
She was sailing up north, right? <+++++> Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
About three months before I met you. <+++++> Why?
Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side. <+++++> I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
Sit down. <+++++> Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
Evan... or Maverick. <+++++> Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew. <+++++> How can you know this?
Getting a reading? <+++++> It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe.
Say hello to London for me. I miss her. <+++++> Oh, yes.
I have had command for the last time Â- <+++++> Come Â- you'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island.
Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender? <+++++> Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
I tell you I'm staying, Pop. Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers. <+++++> You are likeÂ
You're back. <+++++> It's Monday morning.
Very well. <+++++> Very well.
Your his publicist? <+++++> Sure I am. It's fun.
Yeah. It certainly is. <+++++> And you'd feel like an awful sucker if you found yourself marching right in the middle of it, wouldn't you?
Why? You wanna have sex or something? <+++++> Ooh! Can we? !
And the answer is, "of course" but also "no. It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can." <+++++> Good samba dancing...?
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you. <+++++> Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
The truck? <+++++> Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me.
So? <+++++> *That means I don't run Nirdlinger's! *
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. <+++++> That's all right, Eric.
You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day. <+++++> Well did you or didn't you?
He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole. <+++++> Ain't you seen your folks since then?
I'm so happy to see you! <+++++> hurries over.
I can't tell you that. It is quite urgent. <+++++> I would like to use the bathroom --
Hector, Jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank. Time to go home. <+++++> <u>That</u> was a bust.
Some sort of lead or something. <+++++> Radiation shield, you think?
And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon? <+++++> Dr. Hirsch?
This country is hard on people. Hard and crazy. Got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account. <+++++> Most don't.
I've got another story. <+++++> Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
No. <+++++> Too bad. I wasn't in it.
Knock it off, Damone. I need real help. <+++++> What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better. <+++++> Have you found him?
Why do you say that? <+++++> Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that? <+++++> No, we'll find something around here.
I'm... <+++++> Where are you going...? This is me...This is Ricky, Jim. Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.
Hiya, pardner. Long time no see. <+++++> Did anybody follow you? See you come here?
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke. <+++++> Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
I'm sorry, I didn't-- <+++++> What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on? Sunnin' myself?
 <+++++> Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
No! I can still defeat Bavmorda! <+++++> She's too powerful, Raziel
Harold! <+++++> I could carve a better man out of a banana!
Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out. <+++++> God, you smell like whiskey.
I'm here, I've got you... <+++++> I'm so afraid...  ...you won't let it happen...
In your pocket. Give it to me. <+++++> I need it.
C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters. <+++++> You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya? It's gonna take hours just to clean it up.
Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases -- <+++++> Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
To keep out the cold. <+++++> Aye.
I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew. <+++++> What things?
He helped you? <+++++> We were friends once... But that was a long time ago.
If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it? <+++++> I believe I said I'd be tempted.
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein. There doesn't seem to be an serious injury. <+++++> Not to me. But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me... <+++++> You're Margo. Just - Margo.
Checked and locked, sir. <+++++> Louder, girl!
They're not gonna send you right back. <+++++> I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over. All this time. Hiding.
You need new girdles. <+++++> Buy some.
Fuck it, is what I say. <+++++> Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
Oh, shit! I gotta have time to think. <+++++> What is it? Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan. It's all a whim. 'Rob a bank!
The body is a holy repository. <+++++> I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe. <+++++> The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
The Albanian Campaign. <+++++> ...the Albanian Campaign. This... this is history...
She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie. Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name. Paid cash. <+++++> Looks like she was holding out.
I got lots of presents. <+++++> Do you like them?
How can you tell that from a thermometer! <+++++> Those sultry sun-worshipers you watch haven't raised your temperature one degree in four weeks.
You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket? <+++++> We've done it before.
Should you see a doctor? <+++++> I don't know.
It's new. <+++++> I'm sorry. It's too white, too distracting. Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car -- <+++++> Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking -- <+++++> Linda, Linda...!
Nice night. <+++++> Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none.
Tell me where Jacqueline is -Â we've got to find her. <+++++> You don't expect me to do that do you?
Ted, are you okay? <+++++> Just a minute.
Stan? What's going on? <+++++> The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
About twelve hundred. <+++++> I went for four.
Look. I'm warning you. <+++++> What's he do? Nibble your bum?
Scarecrows? <+++++> Let's take a look.
So how's college? <+++++> I dropped out. I mean, uh, you know, this semester I'm taking a, a class, you know, three nights a week.
It may just be a down transmitter. But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor. That's all. <+++++> You wouldn't be going in with the troops. I can guarantee your safety.
Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back? <+++++> Unless you'd like to stay.
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend? <+++++> Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
I'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property. <+++++> Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores!
...I said, I like your hair. <+++++> ...Thank you.
What's happened? <+++++> The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej.
Son? <+++++> Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while.
I don't believe in luck. <+++++> Keep it anyway. I have another one at home.
I put them in your hamper. I thought they were dirty. <+++++> I have a hamper? Next time ask me first, okay. I have more than two grades of laundry.
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad? <+++++> He won't give it to me.
Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you -- <+++++> I'll go with him --
Now This I want to hear. <+++++> For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony.
Can you help me? <+++++> How 'bout Christian Dior?
You see, it paid off--you broke away from the old guard, congresswoman. It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore-- <+++++> Shut up!
I'm not hungry. <+++++> Not sleepy, either?
Philip! The senior partner? <+++++> His secretary just confirmed.
That's frightening. <+++++> It takes different strokes to move the world.
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack. <+++++> Last two like this we had, you caught.
I know I'm limping. I stubbed my toe. <+++++> Are you okay? You want some help?
How do you kill it? <+++++> Separate the character module from the neural net...
Those people were already dead. <+++++> Before the bomb went off?
I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere. <+++++> You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...? <+++++> I would accept that as an axiom.
This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara. <+++++> So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
Oh, that's a phoney. The men didn't even have to go down. <+++++> I thought it might be. From now on, they're going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is Wynant.
Jesus! <+++++> Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend? <+++++> As much as possible.
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on. <+++++> Do you own a car?
Give me the bat. <+++++> Go away from me.
Keep the change. <+++++> Don't think I won't.
Dr. Pemberton? <+++++> Yes!
I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30. <+++++> You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
Look at how cute I am! <+++++> What a little hosebag.
You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live? <+++++> I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
That would be Mars Krupchek. Jesus, he works for me, too. <+++++> Have Louise run the name 'Mars Krupchek' through DMV and NCIC. Tell her to list the tattoo as an identifier.
I'm so tired... <+++++> You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
Just don't fall asleep. Sooner or later something's gonna happen. <+++++> I'll try to stay awake. It's so boring.
I understand. <+++++> May I ask you something?
It has nothing to do with him. <+++++> Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you? <+++++> So?
I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys. <+++++> Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
Who cares? <+++++> Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight.
That's right! And if necessary, I'll drop the big one. <+++++> We have to entertain the possibility ...
I'm so sorry. <+++++> You fucking cow, can't you read? !
What I saw? <+++++> Anything. It's important.
Please put it down. <+++++> How'd he die?
How's Dee? <+++++> Fine. Good.
So...? <+++++> Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X. <+++++> Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
What's that? Present from Faith? <+++++> No idea.
I'm sorry. I'm Pike. This is Benny. <+++++> Pike isn't a name. It's a fish.
She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town. <+++++> She always leaves town, you dummy. That doesn't mean anything. What about in bed? How does she like it in bed?
You think that's a lot of money? <+++++> All I have in the world.
It will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time. <+++++> Ben, Jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom?
It sounds like you still have feelings for him. <+++++> We have a daughter together. I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
 <+++++> What engagement present?
Ever since I started. Gave up piano. Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started. Go figure it all out... <+++++> Yeah? Like what? Limos?
WhereÂs your wallet? Have you got a wallet? <+++++> Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
Oh, no! <+++++> Oh, no!
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you. <+++++> Who?
 <+++++> Elvis is still in there! It's gonna go off!
She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did. <+++++> Then I guess we're even.
You already went back to work. <+++++> What?
Good. <+++++> And something else that might interest you.
I'm sorry, but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side. <+++++> We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria.
Yeah, you know everything! ! <+++++> STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you! !
I'd kill ya. <+++++> From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
...just like that? <+++++> Just like that. Load up the Lincoln... point it West... stop when we hit the fucking ocean.
You just go when I say go. <+++++> Should have at least gotten the map off of him. Blows up with him then we did all this for nothing.
I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this! <+++++> Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before. <+++++> Yes. I'd considered it.
I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past. <+++++> Why not?
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming. <+++++> Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny. <+++++> You told me.
Hi, Ace. <+++++> Hello, Senator.
Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year. <+++++> Has a lot of rain.
You're talking like a drunk. <+++++> That's what I am.
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head. <+++++> But you said "you."
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad. <+++++> You remember what I said about the Vitamins.
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited. <+++++> Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round. <+++++> Some call it resilience. Others, stupidity.
Head towards Union Station. <+++++> What's at Union Station?
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes. <+++++> You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it. Where to?
I was building a doggy door. <+++++> God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here? !
What? <+++++> Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
Keep moving -- <+++++> Now, George --
We should slow down. <+++++> Hands off the suit, monkey-boy. Close your eyes if you're scared.
It left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here... <+++++> What is that?
Nope. <+++++> Good news?
Oh, my goodness ... <+++++> How about you? Are you going to win?
Make it our first date. <+++++> You're not gonna win.
Oh, Christ, you're hurt... <+++++> I killed Grady. I killed Grady, Lisa. I killed Schneider. Oh my God, he's inside me...
Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel? <+++++> I'll keep that in mind.
Shit. Sarah Darling. I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective? <+++++> Yes well we have a suspect, so don't get that worried.
You have to get out of here. Leave as soon as possible. Go to any rural town, away from any major city... <+++++> You are an insane person.
What am I gonna do? <+++++> You got to tell em that you saw the accident. Don't you?
What did I do? <+++++> Panes is not on my team anymore. I'll have Panes if I like.
Call him? <+++++> Call him. Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
Just stop. <+++++> Just giving the facts.
But all he had was chocolate milk. <+++++> I mean him.
Maybe he only likes white meat.... <+++++> Funny, Jake...Funny.
You got something to hide? <+++++> It's too late.
Does Rachel make a lot of money? <+++++> People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
I guess you'll be making' some changes 'round here. <+++++> What's eatin' you, Jocko?
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die? <+++++> I don't want anyone to die.
I need to work out some stuff. <+++++> You're hiding, Jeffrey. You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
I'm telling you. What you really need is someone to carry on the "Burbank" name. <+++++> You think so?
Hey, you on television? <+++++> No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
Fuck you Vincenzo. <+++++> Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
Come here, give me a hug! <+++++> Gee, you're home early!
I saw them kill him! <+++++> What did you <u>really see</u>? This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.
You know what, Ruthie? I better get back to my class, OK? <+++++> And the party?
You think he'll show? <+++++> Did he say he wouldn't?
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow? <+++++> Yeah, I guess... call me...
Right on time, baby. <+++++> Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
I left in a bit of a hurry. I'm terribly grateful, Sean. <+++++> How grateful?
...Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions. <+++++> Remo.
Why? The guys is ready to deal now. <+++++> Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
They took everything... <+++++> Not everything... Do you think I care? I'm a free man again. Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
Yes. <+++++> Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
Anyone else not coming? <+++++> Right behind you.
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy. <+++++> But... wait... there are things to say.
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat. No coolants to preserve food. Millions would die of cold and hunger alone. <+++++> Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
Why does he do it? <+++++> To see if he can get away with it.
You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while. I'll come and get you afterwards... <+++++> Will...
I thought they'd have stopped by now. <+++++> What time is it?
And I love you too. <+++++> And love's a funny thing. Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
PLENTY! TWENTY-SIX MINUTES! <+++++> WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
You don't? <+++++> Nope.
You're livin' in Edina, then? <+++++> Oh, yah, couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson, then!
Numero une, crevettes Ã  la mayonaaise. <+++++> I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ...
Nothing. <+++++> Nothing?
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person. <+++++> Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently.
I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed. In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened. <+++++> We're old friends, Chickie - quit it! A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter!
What makes me sore is how they behave towards you. They ought to be grateful to have you. I certainly am. <+++++> And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
Intruder alert! <+++++> Let's go.
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours. <+++++> Fish can't feel.
That's easy for you to say - you're already dead. <+++++> No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point? <+++++> I don't... ...I just thought it was weird.
Leon hung himself... <+++++> 
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me. <+++++> That so.
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married? <+++++> What...? 0h, yes.
I'll explain it tomorrow! <+++++> Is it hard?
No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe. <+++++> Okay.
Kathy? <+++++> 
What's you last name? <+++++> Childers.
Irena. <+++++> Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
Looks like some sort of code. <+++++> Why would Harry go back to using a code?
All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you. <+++++> I'll say. Holy moley.
Yes? <+++++> And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
How? <+++++> I don't know for Christ's sake!
My best friend got pregnant. <+++++> Before you? Whoo-hoo!
I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh. <+++++> Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
I won't be staying. <+++++> I'm not a half bad cook.
A Toon? Noooo. <+++++> Yeah, a Toon. It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man. <+++++> Oh yeah? What am I - Perry Mason here?
What's the point! You have me, finish it! <+++++> I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.
Fine. <+++++> What do you think I should do?
Stay out of the way! <+++++> Artie! Artie!
Yeah -- <+++++> Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land. <+++++> I see.
Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know. <+++++> The cook again?
Yes, it's-it's wonderful. <+++++> What book did you want to buy? ELLIOT  What? Book?
Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right. <+++++> I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please --
-- Thank you. <+++++> By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done. We don't even know what it is. What did we steal? <+++++> I don't know.
What did security say? <+++++> They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
Well -- last night was not so good. <+++++> I thought she was splendid!
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything? <+++++> I'm sure.
He'll keep calling. <+++++> Max! Dammit! <u>Answer!</u>
But I survived. And I still have that single shot. It's meant for one man. My mutinous first mate-- <+++++> Barbossa.
Grubbel's here. See? <+++++> Yeah. That'sÂthat's him.
Waiting's hard. You never learn how. <+++++> You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
Will champagne help? <+++++> Not enough.
Severed spine. You'd better get in here. Bryant's waiting for you. <+++++> I'll see you in a minute.
We have enemies. <+++++> The Chinese.
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute? <+++++> Sure, just a sec. Excuse me.
But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan ... <+++++> You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
Hold out your hands. <+++++> I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
Certain? <+++++> Perfectly certain, because I shall make him tremble.
But you always knew you couldn't <u>take</u> the credit.... <+++++> 
Fucking A. <+++++> Worse since she talked to who?
And if I didn't want to come? <+++++> I guess I'd ask you why.
So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me. <+++++> Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter Âwhoever she was.
They're coming in here, aren't they? <+++++> No, I told you, they can't. It's not a possibility.
Oh Soph... <+++++> You'll hate it in London. It's wet and miserable. A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized. Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... -- The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank. <+++++> LISTEN TO ME!!
When they realise IÂm missing... <+++++> Shut up and walk...
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here. <+++++> Oh, yeah? Then how'd you find my house?
A wife. She left. <+++++> I'm sorry.
You heard about Carlton Fraser? <+++++> Yes, Jennifer told me. What does that have to do with me?
Old friend? <+++++> Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. HeÂs a man of great integrity.
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus. <+++++> I intend to, believe me. Someone has to.
You do? <+++++> Yeah, you want it?
What did he talk to you about? <+++++> He was upset with moving, I believe.
Thank you, Basil. <+++++> Oh, and Austin...
I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that. <+++++> Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs? <+++++> Hey, don't run away now.
About what? <+++++> 
 <+++++> 
Look, I'm warning you. You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people! <+++++> I'm not going to "do" anything, I promise. But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is.
You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy? <+++++> Wha... ?
No. You're a wreck. <+++++> Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
Her name's Hannah. <+++++> Is that Jango?
What mission? <+++++> To save the world.
Sandy, you want to give us some vision? <+++++> Feast your eyes.
The ambulance guys lugged him up. <+++++> You stayed away?
Good thinking. You figure it out. I'm tired. I'm gonna take a little nap. Wake me if there's a fire. <+++++> Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
Absolutely. <+++++> We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny." Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much. <+++++> I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.
The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder. <+++++> You're the one who should be in politics, John. You're tougher than I am. You never crack.
So what does he want? <+++++> What does he want? He wants revenge.
I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today? <+++++> It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch.
Sir, we are Negroes. All except our a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, the fella that plays the gui-tar. <+++++> Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.
Lotte? Is that you? <+++++> Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
You're saying they mutinied for the gold? <+++++> If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if -- <+++++> You mean you know about this?
Isn't it wonderful? Such a party! <+++++> Yes.
If necessary. <+++++> What if they're naughty?
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway? <+++++> Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car.
Is he serious? ? <+++++> Don't worry about fingerprints. I never had any.
Really? Do tell. <+++++> Gwen.
Where's the car? <+++++> I need to get something straight first.
Back to that mountaintop on Veridian III, before Soran put out the star. I have to stop him. <+++++> What makes you think things will be any different this time?
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play? <+++++> No.
Nick, Vince, Albert and John. <+++++> No women?
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something. <+++++> Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
Yes, I know. <+++++> You probably also know that we found them okay.
What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...? Where's my other shoe? <+++++> What kind of an act is this?
One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat. <+++++> How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
 <+++++> You invented Space Paranoids?
What's it to you? <+++++> Them was nickel apiece candy.
Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway? <+++++> They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit.
Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like "druthers", doesn't it? <+++++> It's okay.
They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture. At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide. <+++++> What's that little air bottle on the machine?
Yeah! <+++++> This is about freedom of speech, Stan, about censorship.
Is Chase Porter your husband? <+++++> Yes.
And even if they did, I wouldn't get it. So there's that on top, then. See, these're personal matters. <+++++> Personal matters.
'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man. <+++++> Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
I still don't. <+++++> Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there.
My wife always said I had a problem trusting people. <+++++> Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant.
Good, good. Give them that. <+++++> What?
You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive. <+++++> Gee whiz--
Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet. <+++++> People come first, Dr. Isley.
It's like they know what every kid's doing. <+++++> They hack into people's programs?
Lemon? <+++++> Sure.
I work alone. <+++++> That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it.
Jesus. <+++++> You don't know me.
He's not a suspect, is he? <+++++> We haven't ruled out that possibil...
Jill! What are you do ... I mean ... how did you ... Are you alright? <+++++> Yes.
No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along. <+++++> Didn' none of these have no breakfast?
Give away food? <+++++> Sacks of grain, even bread.
Then say it. <+++++> Life is good.
What happened to her? <+++++> What do you mean? She's not here?
All right, all right. But I - I - <+++++> You'll get a heart attack like that.
I'm not here to make you feel bad. I'm here for vindication. In my heart... <+++++> You have one?
The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper. <+++++> It's a good idea for a newspaper. Four hundred sixy thousand.
How much you weigh, Johns? <+++++> What the hell's it matter?
Whatever makes you happy. <+++++> I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature. <+++++> Romantic? He rapes her.
Hi. Where's Holly? <+++++> Hi. She's auditioning for a television commercial. She said she's gonna be a little late.
Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby. <+++++> You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.
The workhouse. <+++++> Yes! The workhouse!
I got pinched in the elevator. <+++++> Well, now you know how the other half lives.
It's your favourite... <+++++> Who are you?
In your car <+++++> Why not.
With you. I want to become...become a whole person. I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown. <+++++> James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number! You tried to call and...
The kid needs a man to show him -- <+++++> The kid will do fine on his own. Give it your best shot, Ricky!
Should we get a what? <+++++> points at the motel.
I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island. <+++++> Yes, sir.
Hey. Mason. <+++++> Yeah.
What the hell happened to you? <+++++> Well. I don't really know where to start.
I'm an artist. I'm not like a banker, you know. Like I create. <+++++> I know, man.
Ilsa Lund. That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America. <+++++> You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit.
I think so. <+++++> I've been looking for that flash and I look and I look and I can't find it. And what if I already had it?
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first. <+++++> You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
...Can I come in? <+++++> No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
He's on his way. <+++++> He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?

Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing -- <+++++> They hate each other --
What are you doing out here? <+++++> I might ask you the same question.
Thanks. <+++++> No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook? Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime. <+++++> It's okay.
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog. <+++++> Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
But I'm afraid of-- <+++++> Don't look down.
Captain, we need further Warp simulation on the flow sensors... <+++++> Engineer, we need Warp speed now!
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older. <+++++> If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Me too. <+++++> Okay. Did you bring a condom?
Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system. <+++++> Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!
I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter... <+++++> I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
Were you present when all these things took place? <+++++> Yes!
What's the fight about? That's her fiancee, isn't it? Are they blaming him? <+++++> I don't know! Why are you asking me? How can it take an hour to find an ambulance?
That's right. <+++++> My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
Daniel give me that beanshooter! <+++++> No! No! I won't.
It looks delicious. <+++++> You hear me talkin' to you. The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
May I wash you? <+++++> Groovy.

Yankee Poodle. <+++++> I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.
What? This? <+++++> -- OK?
You won't believe me. <+++++> Try me.
They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away. <+++++> But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
Were you listening to the story, Donny? <+++++> What--
Daddy, what was that noise? <+++++> Gabe? What are you doing ... ?
Mr. Nasty time. But take it easy on me, girl. <+++++> Craig, you ain't the only lightweight around here.
What are you working on, Egon? <+++++> I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.
Has he? <+++++> Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens? <+++++> Yes.
Making a living. <+++++> Good prospects for advancement, is there? A pension? Do you know, I'd almost forgotten what your eyes looked like.
I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why? <+++++> I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.
With what? <+++++> Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning.
How did you feel when he died? <+++++> I loved him. I hurt.
I think it's a different place for each person. <+++++> Did you have a dream?
If ever I need a Boss, Joe. <+++++> Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
I saved your life. <+++++> You shouldn't have.
Objection sustained. <+++++> Did Miss Lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving?
You could have been honest with me for starters. We work together. I have to be able to trust you. <+++++> I admit I handled it badly. Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
That's a nice scream, lady. You oughta be in movies. <+++++> Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious. <+++++> Yeah.
How nice. <+++++> It's my daughter, man. I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.
4-monoxytocin is... "A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland." <+++++> Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.
ItÂs cute. <+++++> What is?
Yeah. <+++++> I've been doing a lot of thinking.
No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign. <+++++> Come now, Mr. Chance.
What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun? <+++++> She's not sick at all. She's pregnant.
You would have done the same for me. <+++++> Why would you do this...?
They are live ones? <+++++> Yes, Master.
What's going on? <+++++> I'll tell you everything later.
Four hundred? <+++++> That's right.
I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules. <+++++> Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
Damn! What is your name? <+++++> Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
I heard that too. <+++++> Did you hear his son is still around?
And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street. <+++++> I'll get your cash. You haven't been straight with me ever since I met you! You never loved me in the first place!
Oh, I wish they wouldn't feed him like that. <+++++> Now he'll be up all night...
Yeah, but I want Carmen. <+++++> You got it bad.
Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes? <+++++> It's the smoke.
Don't be sad, Barry. You'll find true love someday. <+++++> Suck my ass.
Adam, that's not true! <+++++> Yes, it is.
What else did you learn from your mind meld? <+++++> They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
It's worth more money to you. <+++++> Goodbye.
One. Squeeze. <+++++> This is ridiculous...
I'm coming with you. <+++++> No, Dr. Frock. You can't.
Well. See. That was a... reflex to see if it would... <+++++> ... look good on Kimberly.
Oh... <+++++> I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
Father! Thank God you're better! I really need your help. We've only got a few more hours. <+++++> Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
Live ones where only the dead should be? <+++++> Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.
I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile. <+++++> And?--And?--
I had to. You made me. <+++++> Bullshit, you killed him. Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat. <+++++> Ahhhhhh. Leo, Leo, Leo.
What's your name? <+++++> Palm Apodaca.
They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady? <+++++> Inside.
Yes... Isn't it? <+++++> Well, I'm just asking. You sound a little Â
Thanks. <+++++> Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
Lenore, I'm here. I'm getting out. <+++++> I can hear you again, clearly.
What? <+++++> Do you still love me?
In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me. <+++++> Yeah, that's right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get you out of one of your jams.
Too bad he's in Kansas this summer. <+++++> Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
They're holding my husband downstairs. <+++++> Sure. And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
And then shoot them. <+++++> I...I never killed anyone before. I told you that.
Let's look anyway. <+++++> Lord, you're stubborn.
She's moving! <+++++> I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there? <+++++> That's right.
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket. <+++++> They're what?
Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston? <+++++> The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins.
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs. <+++++> I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
Can't talk right now. <+++++> See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear.
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone? You think so? <+++++> Oh, come on! Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
Do you? <+++++> No.
Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's looking for about a quarter's worth. <+++++> Crank or glass?
Okay!!!! Anything else?! ? <+++++> Just how grateful I am.
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand. <+++++> We can do that.
I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again. <+++++> You're trying to make me feel guilty.
All right...  Come along. <+++++> What?
And he's never once attempted escape? <+++++> A man of his notoriety? He wouldn't last a day on the streets without capture.
We have matching luggage. <+++++> What?
C'mon, Laurant, America? <+++++> The job is worth about two million euros. Pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money, Daniel. You leave tomorrow.
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called. <+++++> Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
You wanna do somethin' with me? <+++++> Not really.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen. <+++++> Oh, God, Michael, I know. Why does everything have to be so hard?
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley. <+++++> Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
What? <+++++> I can't feel my legs no more.
Let's go outside and talk. <+++++> What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
Get undressed in your own room, would you? <+++++> I thought you'd missed the train.
Great book. <+++++> You've read The Fountainhead?
Life is not a dream. <+++++> Go to sleep, Spock.
I'm not leaving Midge. <+++++> Don't be an asshole, Richard. They're gonna kill you.
-- talking to you... <+++++> I enjoyed talking to you.
Sure, Jimmy. <+++++> What does J.F.K. stand for?
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here. <+++++> Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
Yes? <+++++> Something happens to my confidence.
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage! <+++++> ...sabotage!
Stop it. <+++++> You stop it.
You're coming with us. <+++++> It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around. <+++++> Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too.
How old is Richard? <+++++> P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
Do you often model for Glaucus? <+++++> Heavens no! I don't have the time.
We already did. <+++++> Do it again.
From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected. <+++++> I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...? <+++++> Because it is exclusive... because <u>everyone</u> will be here...
You look pretty good for a corpse. <+++++> Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha. <+++++> Think this about money still, ya old fool?
Dmitri didn't want the money? <+++++> No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
Is it peace in out time? <+++++> No, Mother! It's War! War!
Sorry I lost my cool like that. It's a funny thing, women. <+++++> Yeah...
Tell you all about her. <+++++> Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her. <+++++> What does this have to do with..?
then why did you marry her - <+++++> It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society. <+++++> You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
Sir, may I suggest -- <+++++> Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
Got any plants? <+++++> No plants.
<u>Niente!</u> <+++++> That's just what I tried to tell him. Well, one word led to another. He really was a very charming fellow.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me. <+++++> Come on, let's rock.
Pretty country. <+++++> Hmm-mmm.
You can't do this! This is New York! Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York..It's...it's too Midwestern. <+++++> Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze.
Gee, I'm flattered. What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead. <+++++> Very funny.
Ahhhhhh -- Alpha Waves. <+++++> 
Yes, please. You said he gave a name... <+++++> James Cole. That's everything we got. None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.
You were right all along. I'm not a Space Ranger. I'm just a toy. A stupid little insignificant toy. <+++++> Whoa, hey -- wait a minute. Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
I think Armani. They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done. <+++++> Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
She undressed alone... she bathed alone. <+++++> Is that normal?
Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light. <+++++> Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves. We'll be our own stoplight.
Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool. <+++++> Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out!
Oh. Er... well you're the file clerk. You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet. <+++++> But what's our relationship? Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
If it's a boy --- Taylor. <+++++> A bit much. Lucas.
You live around here? <+++++> Yeah.
When? <+++++> October 12, 1969.
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter? <+++++> Paul.
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it. <+++++> Yes, I do, sir.
Thank you, Mr Carter. This is Mr. Leland. <+++++> How do you do, Mr. Leland?
Thanks. Why do you do it? <+++++> What do I do?
I need thirteen. <+++++> That's a bit much.
...About what? <+++++> About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow. <+++++> Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
For who? <+++++> For me.
I will. But I must find the right moment. <+++++> Did you see the moon last night?
ThereÂs nothing wrong with the line, sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box. <+++++> A call box? ThatÂs odd. Where exactly?
There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years. <+++++> And Buddy was one of them.
I like the way you talk. <+++++> I like the way you talk.
You have enough worries of your own. <+++++> No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?
Calm down. Let's do it anyway <+++++> I guess you're right...  THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S OKAY!
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends. <+++++> Then I won't bring you....
Knox, you are so infuriating! <+++++> Just give me one chance. If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
...what a lovely perfume. <+++++> 
Crayons? <+++++> This is a real piece of shit.
Still mad at me? <+++++> For what.
Could be. <+++++> You gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk. that doughnut's chocolate you, know.
Fletch! <+++++> What goddamn right do you have to take him?
Discreetly. <+++++> All pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer, an Esper 231 -- I believe -- and a photo over-lay packet is being produced.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand. <+++++> If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
No, Your Honor. <+++++> Maybe you don't know what it's like where Mrs. Crawford comes from -- but I do. I came from a neighborhood just like hers.
I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her. <+++++> We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you? <+++++> No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness? <+++++> Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel. <+++++> What's it about?
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine. <+++++> Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do I do if he smells the trap.
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh <+++++> Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
I told you to shut up. <+++++> Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
You were right. <+++++> About what?
He was our teacher... He was great. <+++++> Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster.
Yes, sir. <+++++> Imagine that - holding the ends of my pants!
--you're going to be on your own. <+++++> So?
Yes, sir. <+++++> Then your toes belong on the other side of it!! !
What's your name? <+++++> Vincent...
What's changed? <+++++> You mean... since this morning?
It's on West Broadway. We can walk. <+++++> Well, I don't want to walk.
You wrote it. <+++++> I couldn't face telling you.
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me. <+++++> You know that's not true.
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization. <+++++> With all of it?
Where is she? <+++++> She's...not here...she went out. She went out of town, she travels a lot.
Seems exciting. <+++++> It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.
I'll think about it. <+++++> Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
I'm gonna try and get us across the border. <+++++> No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that they're back there.
Don't touch it! That's Li Mu Bai's sword. <+++++> Come and get it if you can.
Apology acknowledged. <+++++> Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?
I won't do it anymore. <+++++> Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors! <+++++> No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
Just like that, eh? <+++++> Just like that.
You want some coffee? <+++++> Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
She is very young -- I have an old habit of failure. It would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage. <+++++> A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
Jesus, why? <+++++> I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
A little country club we run for retired bootleggers. I'm gonna put your name up for membership. <+++++> I never join nothin'.
You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me. <+++++> I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry.
If I don't get power up we are! <+++++> Drop the anchor!
This is a very dangerous man. <+++++> I'm a dangerous man. You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
Nor did you, I noticed. <+++++> He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie. <+++++> How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
Great? He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him. <+++++> Oh, that Karl.
For me? <+++++> Open it.
They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works. <+++++> So you are going to talk me to death.
What? Oh yes. <+++++> Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
I'm going to the dance. <+++++> What for?
The robbery. <+++++> No, sir, I'm not involved with that. I'm doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago.
Well, now, maybe you won't have to. <+++++> Always lookin' on the bright side, aren't ya?
Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again. <+++++> Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things.
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple? <+++++> He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple?
Why not? <+++++> Because there's nothing to see.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there. <+++++> You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities. <+++++> What responsibilities?
He would not have spoken of it openly. <+++++> Then, how --
For defending my honor this afternoon. <+++++> I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
It takes all kinds. <+++++> Zat what it takes? I always <u>wondered</u> what it took...
I hate funny exit lines. <+++++> Who was the trunk addressed to?
You'll be missed. <+++++> Screw you!
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad. <+++++> That's also my business.
What? <+++++> Coming.
She's not available. <+++++> We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
I don't care about myself, my wife and four children were sleeping in their beds, they have nothing to do with this. <+++++> Let's get out of this cold.
Right. And how did she dress him? <+++++> ... Like Prince Charming.
What are you doing? <+++++> My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop? <+++++> Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
About yourself? <+++++> About anything.
A scratch? Your arm's off. <+++++> No, it isn't.
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private. <+++++> Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
MOM!! ! <+++++> Boobie... This is the only way you're ever going to learn. I have an opportunity here to teach you about consequences.
Did you get it? Jesus, did I say that? <+++++> Yeah, I got it. Sports training. You learn to follow the ball. How about you do a wrap-up from up here?
They know. They've been watching us. I can feel it. <+++++> They don't know.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock. <+++++> And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
You fellas got names? <+++++> Lansky. Meyer Lansky. And that's Bugsy Siegel ya got there.
He's blind, for Chri... <+++++> I ain't blind, you asshole.
We're from Channel Four, yes. We'd like to find -- <+++++> "This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!" Incredible. Unbelievable! For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?
For the artistic effect. The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask. It's quite striking. <+++++> I don't know.
Are you sure you can afford twenty-five? <+++++> Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean.
Arrrgh! <+++++> It wasn't him.
Heal who? <+++++> The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
Jesus what the hell is that? <+++++> That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside.
I got it! Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel! <+++++> Good work, my son. Now all we need is a way to get there.
You're damn right I'm serious.... <+++++> I'm just getting started....
For an instant... A scout class vessel. <+++++> Could be Grissom. Patch in the hailing frequency. U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please.
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear. <+++++> Ninotchka, you know I am your friend, you can trust me.... Did you bring back anything else?
Well, there it is. Writ large in legal escriture, next step is-- <+++++> Look, uh... Creighton...
I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces? <+++++> That's right.
Do you think that's such a good idea? <+++++> Don't you want to make one?
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid. <+++++> It's nothing to do with money. I don't gamble.
Just when exactly does an actress decide they're her words she's saying and her thoughts she's expressing? <+++++> Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!
OK! Goodbye! <+++++> Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
The show must go on. <+++++> No, dear. Margo must go on. As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
What do you expect me to say to this? <+++++> How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization. The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you... <+++++> Oh. Well, what's this?
You got to merge your whole soul with God. And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost. <+++++> Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely. <+++++> I don't doubt it. But at a time like this we're the least suitable persons to be with him.
Good heart, at what? <+++++> At thy good heart's oppression.
No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about. <+++++> That's a nasty cut you got there.
No shit. You know how he makes his money? <+++++> He sells guns.
And this poetry ÂÂ like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life? <+++++> It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
Inside, they were talking of you. <+++++> I can just imagine.
The dog's always doing that. And the car's always doing that. <+++++> Can I help?
You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out. <+++++> Fine!
Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such "exception" to. <+++++> Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done.
Your mother, and your father <+++++> From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?

You're alive? <+++++> No. He got tired of pretending.
Would you like to try it on? <+++++> 'Scume me.
There's nothing to be sorry about. <+++++> The whole idea is preposterous....
Look, Earl. We gotta go straight. This is all messed up... <+++++> If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
Sounds like Beverly Hills. <+++++> Here, are you always this sarky?
She's gonna kill Scotty! <+++++> BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR!
It's in the driveway. <+++++> Temporarily.
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I? <+++++> Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
What's the writing say? <+++++> Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you were here. Love, Cool Hand Luke.
Goodbye. <+++++> Goodbye.
I sure turned into an interesting driveway. <+++++> You did, sir. GILLIS' VOICE He goes out. Gillis     I pegged him as slightly looks after him, hangs   cuckoo, too.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone. <+++++> I'm sorry.
I love that belt. What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall? <+++++> I always go a size smaller. Makes me look slimmer.
All right, all right. Hey, hey. <+++++> Hey. Mason.
Can you? <+++++> Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but...
Now. But first, he worked for you. <+++++> You were going to have this thug...?
Sure. You got some kind of -- bean juice on it. <+++++> Human bean juice. The Comedian is dead.
Well, this might come in handy. <+++++> Thank you.
Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date? <+++++> Yes.
Such as...? <+++++> My master requires the fort be destroyed. But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied.
So, been married long? <+++++> Eight years.
What kind of job... ? <+++++> A boost. A big boost ...
I don't understand... <+++++> Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago.
You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying. <+++++> That's not what I meant, Dignan.
College president shouldn't drink. Tends to set a bad example, I figure I saved them from a big temptation. <+++++> Oh Christ! I should of been there and I wasn't there, I should've been there.
I was lookin' for you all day today. <+++++> You were?
Don't look like nothing. <+++++> Just banged my head. It was an accident.
No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita. <+++++> Oh. Well, they're just a wonderful couple, we've been friends for years. We visit their island quite often.
Since the murder. She was fine before that. <+++++> Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate.
It's not talk; I'm doing it. <+++++> You would risk your life for strangers?
Are you sure you're OK? <+++++> Yeah I'm fine.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it. <+++++> If it was a ship she hit.
I got in early. I was excited...  Who was that guy? <+++++> Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Mom, just this once, give it a rest. <+++++> You're jet-lagged. We'll talk about this back...
I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident. <+++++> Is he circumcised? Can you imagine what his anus is like? Describe it to me. Would you like to sodomize him?
Eh...? <+++++> That's right?
Yeah? Why not? <+++++> Cause I can't allow it.
What happened? <+++++> I didn't have the guts for it.
To our new life. ...What's wrong? <+++++> That's what I need to ask you. You know you can't keep anything from me.
Gustafson's accountant. <+++++> Yah.
Crony indeed! <+++++> You can get out.
Fun today. Like old times. <+++++> Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
Wha... ? <+++++> Who is this, in the mask? Who is he?
We've certainly been in some swell jams. <+++++> Remember the time we broke into the D.A. 's office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in. <+++++> There's not going to be a debate. You must leave.
How could it not? <+++++> Why don't you ask the Mosebacke? Brazil.
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us. <+++++> And if he's not?
We gotta go, Jack. <+++++> No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty.
Go open the video store. <+++++> Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past. <+++++> You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
Nobody give their right name ... it's the FBI! <+++++> I just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here.
If only we could get a fix. <+++++> What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
It was the best, kid <+++++> So, on to the Life Of Christ!
Guys ready to order? <+++++> Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he -- <+++++> Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
And what is it with you? All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time. <+++++> I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'?
Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin. <+++++> Have them make their own calls.
What's she done? <+++++> You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
More or less. <+++++> Not this twig, friend. I got plans.
Yes, but I... <+++++> What's his name?
How long are you planning to stay in Regan? <+++++> Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.
Excuse me. <+++++> I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available.
You know what's the problem? <+++++> Too much mayonnaise?
You use their witness. <+++++> That's right.
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes. <+++++> Aw, Baby.
This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra. <+++++> Who is LaMagra?
He's mooing. <+++++> You wouldn't?
It's Blake. Meet me at Grand View. <+++++> Where?
I look horrible. <+++++> The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
We did the decent thing. <+++++> This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean? <+++++> ...everybody gotta die sometime Red... Get back to your foxhole.
...resourceful! <+++++> Yes, sir. So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
This psycho can. <+++++> Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
What's that? <+++++> My glands. They grow old too fast.
And how long was it before they caught up with you? <+++++> That time?
I was going to make some pancakes, you can have some if you like. <+++++> Hm.
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here. <+++++> You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
She just seemed... depressed... ? <+++++> She didn't seem herself. For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.
We can't shoot the Old Mill. <+++++> You know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes. Kid the New Guy...
 <+++++> Jesus, how can you stand her?
Dancin' on razor blades here... <+++++> I won't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.
'Course I do, they're my brothers. <+++++> Well...
Like me. <+++++> No. Not like you.
Believed what? <+++++> Nothing, Ray. That Larry, he's a pisser. You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
Tell him it hurt -- <+++++> I have to talk to her, Col --
I know, I know. But still, somehow I don't feel better. <+++++> All right. How about I feel better when you take them?
I thought you were enjoying yourself? <+++++> Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin? <+++++> No.
Is she not here? <+++++> I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor. <+++++> You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Yes. <+++++> What's inside?
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over. <+++++> No...
I can't believe you're still here. <+++++> I'm moving.
Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there. <+++++> But...
And ...? <+++++> There was a lot of dull stuff -- vacation schedules, the like. But then there were a few memos about the holding ponds.
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there. <+++++> Okay, I'll -
We! <+++++> I've got the real thing!
We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows? Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes. <+++++> Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
And she likes Pinot. <+++++> Perfect.
I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues. They don't let everybody in. <+++++> I think we should stop talking.
A dollar seventy-five. <+++++> Okay.
Killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder. <+++++> Jesus. Any word from Brent?
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here. <+++++> What's in the back?
Yes, your honor. <+++++> I see. Well, you'll have to do better than that. Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad? <+++++> Do I? I saw an iceberg once.
The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past? <+++++> Maybe.
A wig? <+++++> Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.
Do you have the tape? <+++++> I might know where you could get a copy.
I hear that's a rather popular date. <+++++> Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
Kent, Kent for Chrissakes. You must be Eleanor. <+++++> Ellie. Pulsar?
Your husband? <+++++> Yes.
Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick. <+++++> Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
...as of today, 89% favorable. <+++++> Eighty-<u>nine</u> percent favorable, is based not on <u>events</u>...
Victor, your scar -- <+++++> I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
Really? <+++++> Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
Did Marylin end up with money? <+++++> She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
So. Is it different to how you imagined it? <+++++> Yes.
Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down. <+++++> I can't.
Stop talking like a monk! Just fight! <+++++> Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
Bribing me again? <+++++> And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?
You never had The Talk, did you? <+++++> No.
Stop it, Dil -- <+++++> Just don't kick Dil and she'll be touched. Be nice to her and she'll be yours forever.
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism. <+++++> Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house? <+++++> I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
Every time you and Marlon-- <+++++> --We could bum around the world for a year on that.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you? <+++++> Go ahead.
Leave us alone right now. <+++++> I've booked you a flight and packed you a bag. You just need to get into a car and go.
What can I say? <+++++> Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.
That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding. <+++++> Current levels may not be sufficient.
What's this? <+++++> So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.
Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself. <+++++> Such as?
You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box? <+++++> The one in Brentwood.
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar. <+++++> Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Depends, who pays? <+++++> Definitely not Martin. Movie stars never pick up the check. They have no idea what things cost.
Did you sleep well? <+++++> Yeah. Too good. I forgot where I was.
Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler? <+++++> Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo! <+++++> You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
There's no way you could know that. <+++++> But I do know. I also know your lines of credit are over-extended.
That would complicate things. <+++++> Because I'd be to blame, right?
And that man with her -Â he doesn't make her laugh ÂÂ he just sits and talks. <+++++> We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything ÂÂ and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
What about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned Italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn't let her! ? <+++++> Waddaya talking about?! !
Oh, yeah. <+++++> You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.
Water mains usually go in the winter. It's August 1st. <+++++> Tell you what. Reminds me of life in the Delta.
You need the money just like we do. <+++++> Shut up, Violet.
What do I get for it? <+++++> You get it's brother.
Do you think the official network would surrender to one man? We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult. <+++++> 
Oops! <+++++> All right, who serves?
I bet you come here on a Saturday night, you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass. <+++++> I do okay.
Yes. She's very old. She's been with us since the beginning. <+++++> The beginning?
Barely living, from the looks of it. <+++++> No, no, no... this is different!
What? <+++++> I believe I can bring him back.
Everything's all right? You okay? <+++++> Yeah, just a cigarette got in a wastebasket.
Oh, boy! <+++++> Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
Huh? <+++++> It's open...  What'll you have?
Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow. <+++++> Aren't you going to change?
Yes, Doctor. <+++++> You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
What happens if you level with her? <+++++> Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
So, you live here alone... I mean with just your brother? <+++++> No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
Yeah? <+++++> Go fix the phones.
Yes. <+++++> That's how a man would do it. I'm not a man.
And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian. <+++++> Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
I have illegitimate children. <+++++> What?
Your moans seem almost pleasurable, my dear... developing a taste for the lash? <+++++> Kill me... I want... so nice...
I'm a toy to her. <+++++> A toy?
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand. <+++++> Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
You heard him. <+++++> Okay, Herr Preismaier, let's have the mail box.
Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer. <+++++> Yes, ma'am.
Where are we? <+++++> Givvem a cigarette...
This is your car. <+++++> You're in a playful mood.
What d'you mean? <+++++> The mafia! La Cosa Nostra!
No. <+++++> I thought your parents were in Italy.
Got you the multivitamins and the iron tablets, hon -- <+++++> Don't call me that --
Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ? <+++++> Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude. <+++++> You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
What about them? <+++++> They're playing games behind the couch ...
Then don't go out with me. <+++++> For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella. <+++++> Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
I'll take care of it. <+++++> Where can we go?
Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something? <+++++> No, it's coming.
Max Reiss, novelty acts. Was that judo or something? Ah, skip it. Question is, can you do it again? <+++++> Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but--
Have you seen Willie? <+++++> Is he not back yet?
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that. <+++++> I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece.
We could try pushing the other buttons. I have a flashlight in my purse. <+++++> It won't work.
Well, go get it then. <+++++> Where is it?
Yeah. Do you paint? <+++++> No.
And you dropped it? <+++++> Yeah! Shh!
Wonder where we'll be then. <+++++> The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty.
You're a lucky man, Diego. <+++++> I love you, my brother, do you know that?
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute. <+++++> Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now? You wanna go for a ride?
No, it reminds me. <+++++> Would you like one? Huh?
You gotta stop thinking like that. <+++++> Then, where are you going?
I don't care about your sword. <+++++> Why were you spying on the Yus?
But your instinct was to lose sail? <+++++> My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
Oh Captain, My Captain, we came here so I could talk to you about something. <+++++> Okay.
Hey, you alright? <+++++> What?
What is it with you people and pain? <+++++> We need it. Sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest. Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring -- because we regenerate, none of it's permanent.
Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch. <+++++> Why didn't he just go public with the tape? Save himself that way.
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties. <+++++> The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
I know. <+++++> I've never admitted that to anyone.
I can check and call you back. <+++++> Thank you. I'm at 639-7393.
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway. <+++++> What stuff?
What's Doug do in Chicago? <+++++> He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you. <+++++> What?
What happened to Sam? <+++++> Who are you?
Can you imagine that brain in this body? <+++++> I'm getting excited just thinking about it. What if he's not there?
This is undeclared income. <+++++> And who's gonna find out?
You know what else? <+++++> What?
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams. <+++++> Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.
Ask me them again. One by one. <+++++> What do you do?
Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering? <+++++> You wanna know? Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya. One of you Toons killed my brother.
What are you saying? That you don't have sex with men? <+++++> I don't.
No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean. <+++++> The guy's a Boy Scout, Bob. He declared frequent flyer miles on his income tax return.
Which part of no don't you understand? <+++++> Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.
Why do you hate me? It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop. <+++++> Two words. Disco Express.
You heard me. <+++++> Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
They'll know whether he killed himself. <+++++> I don't.
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do. <+++++> Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from? <+++++> Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -
Well... how have you been? <+++++> Fine. Everything much the same. When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately. Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking? <+++++> You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name?
He phoned it in. <+++++> I see.
Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions. <+++++> He's running the show.
But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender. <+++++> However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
Nicole... <+++++> Later for it.
Oh yeah. Can you just take us to Washington? We're gonna meet her there and, you know, heh heh hmmm... <+++++> Washington! That's where she was gonna meet up with ya? Damn, she's goin' all the way!
He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook! <+++++> Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you!
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me. <+++++> That's good. Terrific.
Walter, you can't do that. These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector. <+++++> You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point. Not in Nam, of course--
What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates? <+++++> Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.
...Ma?? ? <+++++> Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!
Aw-right. What about the other guy? <+++++> She didn't know him. But she said her son might.
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes? <+++++> They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells. <+++++> 
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks. <+++++> Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos. <+++++> Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.
Shut up. I'm all right. <+++++> Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
Let's do it here. <+++++> What about him?
Did she know where Nix was buried? <+++++> No.
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married! <+++++> Darling!
What? <+++++> You know, "some". The fag stuff.
Ten. There's a lot of other places I could work. <+++++> A ten percent raise and benefits. But that's it. I'm drawing the line.
I don't suppose you've seen her. <+++++> Have I seen her?
Please. <+++++> Besides attending all your regular classes, I'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school --
I want to talk to you. <+++++> Talk to me?...Of course...Come on...
What's going on in there? <+++++> Some meeting. With PG&E people.
No problem. We're in. <+++++> Okay. Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit? <+++++> What?
They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails. <+++++> You have a yacht?
Yes. <+++++> This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh.... I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money.
Would you please calm down. Tell me what happened. <+++++> Stuckey! He wants an "appointment" with me after you leave. You my pimp now or did he think that up on his own?
Goddamn landlord. <+++++> I told you this was gonna happen.
She's only perfect. <+++++> Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes. <+++++> Nah. Don't sweat it.
Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too? <+++++> Sure.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute. ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa? <+++++> Aw, shit... I gotta pee anyway.
Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out. <+++++> Very well... Can we rule out inefficiency...?
...they're from Baltimore.... <+++++> I've never heard that he...
I think so. Maybe. <+++++> You are so brilliant.
How's your star? <+++++> Gosh, you look nice.
What else do we know? <+++++> I just wish we knew when someone would talk to us, that's all.
Thank. you, Master Control. <+++++> We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here. <+++++> You own this land.
One officer already got killed trying to protect me. Please, just take it all away. Leave me alone. <+++++> <u>He</u> won't.
The principal? <+++++> Yes.
That's something I haven't done in fifteen years. <+++++> What?
Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off? <+++++> Who says I'm the one that called it off?
Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully. <+++++> And how will you make him keep it?
And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress... <+++++> Shrink major, not a shrink.
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out. <+++++> Exactly. Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS. <+++++> I'd better take a look anyway.
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning. <+++++> How? When?
You first. <+++++> How about both of us at the same time?
And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong. How could you be so careless? <+++++> I'm sorry. I think I was crying.
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand... <+++++> You're going to return every cent of it!
I know. Anyway -- <+++++> Anyway, I've got to do my tap dance here.
Got a minute, Jack? <+++++> IÂve got all the time in the world...
Yes. The actors. I must destroy the actors. <+++++> Stop! Stop! This is insanity.
Well, maybe they're not. <+++++> No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber... <+++++> There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh!
What the hell's going on! ? <+++++> Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
No. No chains either. <+++++> You ain't man enough to wear them!
I love the pillows. <+++++> Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
I never like to talk about my work. <+++++> Alright. Well, that's something new.
I'm sorry. <+++++> You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
Yessir. <+++++> Give me that.
You hired someone to open it. I'll bet the lawyer loved that. <+++++> There was nothing he could do. My husband left everything to me. I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.
Sharon's far from a slut. <+++++> And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy. <+++++> 
You probably also know that we found them okay. <+++++> Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
Oh, Jesus. <+++++> No question, huh?
He's an organic farmer. <+++++> Oh. Well, that would be a ... change. Thank you, Mrs. Peterson. You have a very reassuring voice.
You're his sister, right? <+++++> Rick stayed later after school with Kristen. She wasn't feeling very well.
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two. <+++++> This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us. <+++++> She came up here on her vacation, 'cause she likes shitty weather.
Maybe that's why you can't catch him. I <u>know</u> what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer. <+++++> I just came from her... here's what you haven't seen.
That's exactly what I want you to do. <+++++> What about you?
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now. <+++++> She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow. <+++++> Yes -- she did.
You don't? <+++++> Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it. <+++++> The rules of engagement are not flexible. They exist for your safety. You will obey them. Is that clear?
What? <+++++> Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married.
On the contrary. I want you - unharmed - perfect. <+++++> Why?
You must have come a long way. <+++++> About 250 million of your miles.
He can learn. He is learning. <+++++> You really think so? Did you tell him you were pregnant?
I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage. <+++++> Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?
What? <+++++> Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
What?! ? <+++++> I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
I'm not sure... <+++++> What do you mean?
They aren't as watchful as you. <+++++> Too busy looking after themselves.
Sorry, it's my book now. <+++++> Blonde, shoot this piece of shit, will ya?
 <+++++> Thank you or calling Central Services.
Yeah, well, that's what I do too. <+++++> What?
 <+++++> Why don't you go to the police?
...stole the truck. <+++++> Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck. Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...
Probably the caffeine. <+++++> Do you have something to bring me down?
Don't even think you're walking away from me. <+++++> <u>I don't wanna know you!</u>
For me? <+++++> Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
Mmm. <+++++> Yes. Mmm. Yes. Precisely. Precisely. 'Cause your partner depends on it.
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but... <+++++> What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that. <+++++> We miss you. We miss our son.
I see you got the telegram. <+++++> Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.
I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return. <+++++> Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes? <+++++> No. Only an object of equal size.
Anna... Maybe it would be better to wait a while. <+++++> Wait for what?
No. <+++++> His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
Sanchez...? <+++++> I'm here.
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"? <+++++> Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away. <+++++> David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
Wait. What, what are you saying? <+++++> I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
What? <+++++> A magazine? A toy perhaps? In the bookstore.
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl. <+++++> Do you feed on mice and rats?
Well, where are they? <+++++> We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
Joey ... ? <+++++> Help me pick 'em up, Terri. I think the lady just made a sale.
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified! <+++++> What the hell is it, anyhow?
... Peddles it to this old skate down there! <+++++> Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
Want me to wake her up? <+++++> I'II go....is it...back here?
Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all? You know how to boil water? <+++++> I can handle that.
"External mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust. Aggressiveness: extreme." <+++++> So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
Oh, well. <+++++> Why are you lying?
What? <+++++> Yesterday.
It's true. Has to be said. I got off to a slow start. <+++++> I don't believe it.
You lose! <+++++> I suppose anything's possible.
What do you mean, "'yes"? <+++++> Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
It is? <+++++> Yes, it's lame.
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie? <+++++> I won't have to.
I know that -- <+++++> You don't know that. You couldn't possibly.
I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too. A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours. <+++++> Maybe if we had them both to dinner or something.
That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ. <+++++> No, Mr. White. Pierce Morehouse Patchett. Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.
It's what he would have wanted, sir. <+++++> What he wanted? Look... look at him. Look at him! What does he want? This is a person.
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals. <+++++> Good God Almighty, bless your bones. But the problem grows.
So? <+++++> So let's kill the motherfucker. I mean, what are you guys... like that's your new thing right?
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now. <+++++> O.K.
We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay? <+++++> Okay, Mom.
The house, antiques, your model. Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone. <+++++> What makes you think she likes me?
We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once. <+++++> Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected.
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people. <+++++> They haven't been tough on me. I just lost my money. But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
Don't even...I'm there. <+++++> I wasn't sure.
Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money. <+++++> Goody!
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you. <+++++> Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches?
Why show me? <+++++> I'm going to run.
Wallowing in sin and lust... <+++++> They need guidance.
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job? <+++++> You know about that?
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet. <+++++> About the baby.
No, you're not. <+++++> No? Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.
If John Doe's head splits open and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it. <+++++> I will.
Hey. This is looking good! Paul, where's the octopus motor? <+++++> What octopus motor?
You put everything on the line because you... <+++++> You slept with the fucker! !
Story of my life. <+++++> I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding. Outside. I could be outside --
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze? <+++++> No, no, I wasn't trying.
They're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups. <+++++> That's awful.
He disappeared. Later he was found dead. <+++++> I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone.
I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom. <+++++> What time was this?
Is it a bomb? A booby trap? Tell me! <+++++> Stop, please! I don't know!
What? <+++++> Is that what you're trying to tell me?
...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way. <+++++> You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
...we, we love her, Dick and me... <+++++> ...I'm sure you do...
Oh, boy. Will ya take a look at all those presents? ! <+++++> I can't see a thing!
I know. I called them. <+++++> Shouldn't we --
 <+++++> Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to.
Her name was Elizabeth. <+++++> So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
Republican? <+++++> Sure.
Don't make me come there. Answer me. <+++++> I love you.
I had no idea you'd be this good! <+++++> Neither did I!
But my sleeping is really fucked up. <+++++> I don't think I've slept in a year.
I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that. <+++++> Hit don't make no difference where I was to be. We'll always be friends. There ain't no way to stop that.
Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you. Proof! <+++++> Martin, this is kind of an official meeting
Yes, that's good. Until he meets <+++++> Ethel.
I don't know, nobody does. I'm an employee. <+++++> Then, what good are you?
You want me to come with? <+++++> I should do this myself.
I don't think we should leave her alone. <+++++> You're right. We should stay.
How many leads have we got? <+++++> The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand. Five. Five thousand leads.
What makes you think I would do that? <+++++> I'm your son.
How can you be so sure? <+++++> Well, uh... I'm an expert-about stuff like this -- she was totally for real!
Yes. I am. I'm sorry to antagonize you. <+++++> Let me...
We did it. <+++++> There better not be anything missing. This is private property.
Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here. <+++++> A lot of men come in here?
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think. Tell us why all apes are created equal. <+++++> Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
Injected Windex! Why would he switch to a new m.o. ? <+++++> Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him. Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.
We're about ready to go here. Are you ready? <+++++> Let's do it.
What's going on? <+++++> There may be jobs where you can disappear for days at a time, but this isn't one of them.
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse! Junk! Heroin! <+++++> Is that what that is? I never seen any before. I always thought that stuff was expensive!
...and... <+++++> And? NO. I don't wanna know. What do you <u>mean</u> "and..."?
Ah, leave him alone. He's doing no harm. <+++++> With a face like that? I don't want you looking at me. You hear?
Wonder what he said. <+++++> My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said "you complete me." _ 40.
Where's Jesse? <+++++> There is no Jesse. I'm Jesse now.
...quarrel? <+++++> If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him.
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth? <+++++> Yes.
It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill! <+++++> It was?
Like the shields Reed said would protect us. How long? <+++++> At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
Who's my real father, man? <+++++> He, he, lives in South America... he's doing that anthropologist- archeologist-dentist kind of thing ... he's real busy.
Yeah? Outta what? <+++++> Outta my job, outta Seahaven, off this island...<i>out!</i>
What's your game? What do you shoot? <+++++> You name it, we shoot it.
It's me. <+++++> Bourne?
You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man.... <+++++> The females have eggs....
Know what I always thought I wanted outta life, Erin? A Jaguar. <+++++> Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
Hudson, don't you understand... <+++++> And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman. I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.
I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house. you'll check on her - every day...? <+++++> Every day  twice.
Exactly. <+++++> Then why especially does it have to be in German?
You got a warrant for this? <+++++> Yes, Sir.
I hate outside! I hate it! <+++++> We'll be all right...  We will...
I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured! <+++++> I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
Now, monsieur, you have no right... <+++++> Just a moment. I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties.
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on. <+++++> Let me see it. Did you drop it?
Captain Walt Muldoon, NYPD. <+++++> Detective Sergeant Phil Heller.
Whatever you say Kojak. <+++++> I'm serious.
Oh no. Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you. <+++++> But if it's sickening for you --
Better known to his friends as the Death's-head Moth... <+++++> The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell. Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time. Didn't I read that?
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll-- <+++++> You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
What are you doing? <+++++> Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.
It's early yet. <+++++> It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night. <+++++> Can I come?
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself. If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong? <+++++> The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.
Gardiner, yes, sir. <+++++> And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
What'd you say? <+++++> I said you're soft.
Have you got a match on the bullet? <+++++> No.
Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir? <+++++> I would, actually.
It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close. <+++++> Listen, we get a deluge like this, just deciding priorities on a medical basis is hard enough. So never mind the side issues.
I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman. <+++++> Who is that?
It's a myth. Some kind of counterfeit. <+++++> It's much more than a counterfeit. 14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.
He was creepy. <+++++> Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
What the fuck are you doing? <+++++> I-I'll tip her.
Someone stole my car. <+++++> Grady.
Do you mean to say you'd set it off in your own country? <+++++> Naturally. It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only. <+++++> They'd gone.
Yes mother. <+++++> I mean it now. I carried the two of you little bastards around in my belly at the same time you ungrateful pissants.
You don't understand. You have been chosen. <+++++> Chosen to go to the graveyard? Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends. <+++++> Okay. Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
What's her name? <+++++> I don't know.
No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this. <+++++> Frida, wait. Don't go. We can just sleep. I just want to wake up with you.
...back... <+++++> ...and that power...
What'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were? <+++++> W...B...2...YXB.
Follow me then to plainer ground. God, I love this! <+++++> This play?
No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about. <+++++> Like what, Will?
Even the bedchamber passages! Let none remain! <+++++> Yes, your Majesty.
Envelopes? * <+++++> He knows you're no good on the phone, so		    * he calls you up to bullshit you.
Say something. <+++++> What?
Oh, sit down, man. What you tasting? I'm buying. <+++++> I ain't drinking hot piss with you. Come on, Sam.
I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard. <+++++> That's forgotten.
What have I got to do with it? <+++++> Everything.
Every word, Starling? Every gesture? <+++++> Right down to the kleenex I used. Sir, why? Is something wrong?
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier. <+++++> You goin' out?
We shouldn't buy a single slice, spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there. <+++++> That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
...if we don't get out of this tunnel! <+++++> INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem. <+++++> It's gone too far.
Maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking. <+++++> And nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity.
Hardly. You have six bedrooms <+++++> I know.
Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope. <+++++> They're much smaller than bacteria...
So youÂre telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? ThatÂs a down payment on a Ford Focus! <+++++> Not dollars. Pounds.
The "stiff?" He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man. <+++++> Is he dying or something?
It is you Junior! <+++++> Don't call me that, please.
Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down? <+++++> Because they got wet.
It's always in the more gifted of the three. <+++++> Which one is that?
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you. <+++++> 
Hey. It's me. <+++++> Where are you?
Let me out. <+++++> Listen to me-
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again. <+++++> Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.
I want to know who is responsible for this treatment. <+++++> Yes, sir!
God, you need help. <+++++> I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy.
Can't see a thing. Are you sure? <+++++> Yeah, I...
Yeah. You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here. <+++++> Alright. Thank you.
Have you seen him with someone? <+++++> No... I can just tell.
Where's my baggy pants? <+++++> Here. Whenever you want them.
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views! <+++++> It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous. Nature can be wonderful and terrible.
Everyday. Now that's about a quarter mile each way... 17 years... that comes to about three thousand miles...  And you know what Kris? <+++++> What Mr. Parker?
Hold on a second. <+++++> Eddie, come on.
The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape. <+++++> This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer? <+++++> Yeah, I think so.
In the middle? We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish. <+++++> You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
Want to talk to you. <+++++> Okay.
W-w-whatta you mean? <+++++> I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.
Come on. <+++++> Come on...
Those are the Hoyts. <+++++> I don't care. They're out.
You had no inner feeling? <+++++> None.
Oh yeah, to what? <+++++> You'll be me.
My...my neck. Perfect? Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect. Go ahead -- bang on it! <+++++> Oh --!
You're glowing again. <+++++> A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution.
What are you gonna do? <+++++> I'm going to kill him.
Does that help? <+++++> Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
I'll brook no denial! <+++++> It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
Mr. Willis? <+++++> Yes, sir.
God, Spiderman looks different. <+++++> He was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr. Gene Scott?
Where? <+++++> Yeah. Pull in here. Park it.
It reminded me of my dog Callie. <+++++> Is Callie still around?
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed. <+++++> They're like demons, Jez.
Well... <+++++> It's just filthy. People are dirty. I think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people.
So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night. Michael has served his purpose. And soon we will have a new progeny. <+++++> Jamie's baby ...
Easy, Dude. <+++++> We're screwed now! We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
How bad is it? Bad enough for-- <+++++> Yes. I've never been very far from it, for a long time. Will you do something for me?
Please go away, Thel...I...I just have to be by myself for a little while... <+++++> Ted, I just heard...
Do not turn your back on me. <+++++> You are really going to force this, aren't you?
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you- <+++++> I'm not enough for a paragraph.
I don't know what we're facing. <+++++> I understand.
Yes. <+++++> Where?
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down. <+++++> Thank you. Can I see her?
But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it. <+++++> Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do? I'll build in a counter-punch!
You think so? <+++++> You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
This is how I helped you, right? <+++++> Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
Okay. You didn't like the party, huh? <+++++> Too many smart people in one room -- it's not healthy...
I have no memory. <+++++> Amnesia?
I guess it's,the Plaza then. That brings us to the twenty-seventh. We got the Avedon for three or the Park downtown for two. <+++++> We take the Avedon, right? Simple.
That's stupid. <+++++> Why? People fart backwards.
I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass. <+++++> You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy. We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end.
Antarctica? ? <+++++> Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat. He invited us to come along. I've been thinking. If things do get nasty . . .
You... you're a beast! <+++++> We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
They just left, didn't they? <+++++> What are you, drunk?
He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him! <+++++> And then?
What are you doing? <+++++> Please.
Oh yeah, the board. I guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws to ya, huh, Norman? <+++++> Norville.
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy. <+++++> The one of 'em still alive?
I've got the check... <+++++> Forget it. Frame it. It's worthless.
It most certainly is. <+++++> Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
Are you okay? <+++++> Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine. Could you cut me down?
You haven't seen Susie, have you? <+++++> No. Why?
This is Mr.--er-- <+++++> Brett is the name.
Nicky comes on Sunday's. <+++++> Where are your glasses? Go get them.
What do you want from me? <+++++> Well, the man of the hour that we all would like to talk to about now has apparently skipped town.
I never heard of it. <+++++> It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
Something's wrong with you. <+++++> Nothing is wrong with me. I know something's in there - and so do you.
Really? <+++++> But listen, Glenn. If you're lying to me...
You tricked me. <+++++> You need me.
A little mushy. <+++++> A little mushy! You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm. <+++++> 
Now... you go home. <+++++> No! I mean... why so soon?
Why is that? <+++++> Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there... <+++++> What's still there?
An hour? <+++++> Mmm.
Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here -- <+++++> But you will.
I don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me. I was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial--- <+++++> Everybody knows who you are. You're famous.
... I thought it was the drug store. <+++++> Are you sick, Louis?
What about Luther? <+++++> What about Ganz?
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab. <+++++> You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me.
When? <+++++> Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour. Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
You feeling all right? <+++++> Come on, Jim. I'm serious. Dot... Dash. It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.
I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise. I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it. <+++++> How the hell did he find it?
I don't remember <+++++> Think.
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened. <+++++> I want to go home.
There's... a wall between you -- <+++++> -- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country. He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere. <+++++> I'd sure like to know who.
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother? <+++++> She'll be all right.
Oh! You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco! The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879? <+++++> Yeah.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask -- <+++++> Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
How are you fixed? <+++++> I'm okay, Matt.
Fortunately, I am to be married. With your highness, permission. <+++++> Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time. <+++++> What's that supposed to mean?
Pay the rent. Let the tailor wait. <+++++> It won't leave much of a balance in the bank...  Mr. Robard? Could you locate him?
Surprise, surprise. <+++++> I'm not a field agent, all right? So cut me a break.
I doubt it. <+++++> I see. Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
James! That's a policeman. Pretend you don't know me. If he sees you... <+++++> No, I want to turn myself in. Where is he? Don't worry -- it's all okay now. I'm not crazy any more!

Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit. <+++++> But it can't wait.
Mr. Spock, what would V'ger need to fulfill itself? <+++++> V'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe, thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions.
She just don't know how I ain't like that no more. <+++++> Well, she...

This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom! <+++++> Hang in there, I'll think of something.
Oh, you're changing your mind -- <+++++> No, I'm not, but --
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us. <+++++> Pris?

And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered. <+++++> Could these wormholes appear in nature?

She's still alive. <+++++> The transmission is an hour old...

I didn't say that. <+++++> You didn't have to.........
There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact. <+++++> Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?

I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific. <+++++> Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers... <+++++> Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent. <+++++> Who did you get it from?

Are you alright? <+++++> Pigsty.
Naw. <+++++> And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
How was it...? <+++++> From the store.
What's your point? <+++++> No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
But that's what we're here to find out, right? <+++++> You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
You need to make these your primary "action items." <+++++> He was full of pep. Must've had his grande latte enema.
No. <+++++> He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.

Mike's gotta go. Nice to meet you. <+++++> Yeah, nice meetin' yuh.
You're connected to this guy somehow. He's after you -- just like the others were. <+++++> It's late.
I'm fine. <+++++> Can I get you something?
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail. <+++++> I thought that was in detail.
Let's see it. <+++++> I gave it back to her.
The mirror. You can't see yourself in it. <+++++> I don't want to.
What do you mean, we must abandon? <+++++> Ruptured steam pipe.
What do you propose? <+++++> I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation.

You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls... <+++++> All right, cut me a break.
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot. <+++++> Great, thanks for the tip.
Well, it's very easy. You simply raise more money than you really need. <+++++> What do you mean?
What? <+++++> 
We don't have much time left! Go on! Go on! <+++++> I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
Who is, then? <+++++> I don't know. Merlin brought you to me when you were newly born and charged me to raise you as my own.
I understand you joined up in Bremen. <+++++> You seem to understand a great deal.
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies. <+++++> What do you mean?
-- anything you want -- <+++++> I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
Blue, then. <+++++> Blue is cold.
SHUT UP! SHUT UP! <+++++> Put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man.
Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago. <+++++> Well, yeah it's a classic.
Here it comes again ... the sacred job... <+++++> That's right. I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong...
She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go. <+++++> Oh, wait. Wait . . . Wait a minute.

 <+++++> Sang? His name is a past tense?
What is it, 97 days? <+++++> Till this opens, not our wedding.
They are. <+++++> So who's going to know?
I didn't know that. <+++++> Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
No, you're not. Max! Max! <+++++> Max is a good idea. He can help with my luggage. Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.
Yeah. <+++++> How many?
For what? <+++++> For being one helluva guy.
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City. <+++++> So?
Like a sister? <+++++> Jamie, sometimes it's...
Did you really ask? <+++++> I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
You hit a bad streak. We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole. <+++++> He said he filed...
And tell me that she's happy. <+++++> Oh, Dmitri.I wish that I could.
GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE! ! <+++++> "Fuck"? You think I don't know this word "fuck"? Is that how you talk to policemen in America?
Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for. <+++++> Any of them hot?
Dominick said they're in the motel? <+++++> Yeah, either that or in the fuckin' bank. I don't know. They're all over the joint.
Interesting analogy. <+++++> I'm babbling.
Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood. <+++++> Alex.
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage. <+++++> Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books.
Easy, Bill. <+++++> I seen the angel of death Ned, an' I seen the river. He's a snake, he got... snake eyes.
Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice. <+++++> I'll torture it out of you.
A piece of shrapnel hit me. <+++++> I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice.
I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor. <+++++> That's right, Jan.
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it? <+++++> The what?
If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message. <+++++> We're going to work on the message.
I have feelings for you. <+++++> Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards. <+++++> It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter. Did you find out where the bomb is?
Yes. Yes. That's exactly it. Yes. <+++++> Okay.
Yeah? <+++++> I'll wait for you till seven.
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'? <+++++> Look, a man can make an honest mistake!! Anyway, she was asking for it! They're all asking for it all the time! !
Full impulse. <+++++> The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man. <+++++> Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
I think it worked out okay, donÂt you? <+++++> Sure. I really like Annie.
I'm not going! <+++++> I'll get your bag.
You survived it. It can't hurt you now. It's no good to dig it up. <+++++> Oh no, my friend. It's digging itself up. There is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it.
I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing. <+++++> Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?
This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so! Do you deny that? <+++++> That's got nothing to do with it!
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school. <+++++> You timed that beautifully.
You're going to take a year off? Join the Peace Corps -- ? <+++++> No.
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it. <+++++> Is there any way you could get into his truck?
Boo. <+++++> Hi.
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise. <+++++> It's not a real "funny" time for us, okay?
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson. <+++++> What happened? You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
Why don't I feel like celebrating? <+++++> Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge. <+++++> The milkmaid's daughter?
 <+++++> Appy polly loggies. I had something of a pain in the gulliver so had to sleep. I was not awakened when I gave orders for awakening.
And here they are! <+++++> And she was saying how happy you were to finally have them over. Because you're both, so, what - introspective?
You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how. <+++++> I'll take some lessons this time. I promise.
Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out. <+++++> [Beat] We will.
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body. <+++++> Tut, tut! I can play at fencing as well as you, Mr. Roderick James. Ah! You change color, do you?
Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag? <+++++> Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
Why not? <+++++> I'm not hungry. What's wrong? I spent all morning on that soup. I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
You're back. What happened? Never mind. What's going on? <+++++> I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir. We've had some problems.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he? <+++++> It's not like that, luv.
I don't know what this crazy bitch is on. You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business. <+++++> Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Then where did I get this?
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year? <+++++> I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that. <+++++> Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts. _ 86.
I don't know. <+++++> Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.
Yeah. <+++++> Okay. You behave yourself.
 <+++++> We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
Hold it, hold it... <+++++> What's wrong?
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them? <+++++> Sometimes.
Eddie, you're a born loser. <+++++> What's that supposed to mean?
I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself? <+++++> Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me...
You're lying -- <+++++> Pull up my sleeve. Right arm.
What? <+++++> What do you need me for?
What are you up to? <+++++> That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember? That was made out of the metal of ordinary things.
Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes. <+++++> Why don't you put me in chains?
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner. <+++++> I'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy.
How was the beach? <+++++> Fine.
No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners. He was like a... like -- <+++++> A son.
Northeast? That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi. <+++++> There's another pass on the photo.
What's it matter? Get to the point. <+++++> Look -- you know the girls -- Thta's Terri -- she was playmate of --
Why don't you answer the man, Sidalee? He's trying to take you off the hook. <+++++> You just had a good example of it. A press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna.
Maybe you should talk to him about it. <+++++> I can't... I just don't know how to...
Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes. He won't be long. <+++++> I promised I'd be at the Robinson's. They've lost nine today.
Does what feel comfortable? <+++++> This could be it.
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean? I don't think so. <+++++> I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
Pardon? <+++++> I said--shall we get started *now* or--
I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend? <+++++> Someone in the formal set, no doubt, with a ten-carat kidney stone.
If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now? <+++++> I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
-- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, John! <+++++> You think you can make me tell! But I won't! I won't! I won't!
You are going after Mayor Bennett. <+++++> Let's just say I'm sending a very clear message to his ReÂElection Rally...
Talk to me. Let's assess. <+++++> Right.
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it. <+++++> Alright. How much you need, ho?
Justin, finish your sweep. <+++++> Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you. <+++++> What?
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now. <+++++> Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
I like that... yeah! <+++++> Sal wanted to go to Wyoming. I told him it wasn't a country. We gotta get outta the country!
No. <+++++> How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
Hey, Violet! Hey, listen ÂÂ that's Violet Bick! <+++++> I know. I know.
I'm getting married. <+++++> To whom?
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go. <+++++> Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought -- <+++++> -- You thought what?
Let's go. <+++++> She's not very nice, is she?
Mr. Arnold? He's not answering me. Okay I'm on the grating. <+++++> Good! Keep going, now. The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
Sure. <+++++> Great. Sit down. Oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30. <+++++> You're going to miss your train! Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began. <+++++> I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
Well, in times like these most people are cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and fifty? <+++++> Oh, madame, you're just too sweet for words!
You want to know the trouble with you? You think it makes you a big man if you can give the answers. <+++++> Listen, JohnnyÂ
A private investigator? <+++++> Mr. Gittes.
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter. <+++++> Don't you remember....
People are pretty cagey. Who do you know? <+++++> For what?
You get benefits? <+++++> No.
I'm just an accountant. <+++++> Don't denigrate yourself, my friend. Where would the government be without accountants?
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight. <+++++> I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
Oh. You wanna talk about that stuff. <+++++> Yes I do. Terri, something awful happened to that boy. I have to find out what it was.
The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am... <+++++> Oh, you. You talk same as you write.
What? <+++++> Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
And you? <+++++> I didn't dive.
...and sort of...disinterest. <+++++> Disinterest?
Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh! <+++++> And another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you?

When will they be here? <+++++> Very soon.
God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him. <+++++> I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
Why did you write remember on the wall? <+++++> That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself. Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
That's right. <+++++> You bring American money?
So how're you doing? <+++++> Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man. <+++++> Unnhh!
I feel much better. Thank you. <+++++> Are you comfortable here?
That's great! <+++++> How can I possibly thank you?
It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers... <+++++> So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
Susan! <+++++> Wellie well, Dr. Bright. You're just in time.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. <+++++> You need not worry...Not just now, anyway.

Yes. <+++++> Do you like it when he asks you?
Doom. <+++++> Jesus Christ... <u>that</u> was the Judge?

Good Lord. So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match. <+++++> Do they know yet?
Okay. <+++++> Come on. Inside.
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators... <+++++> 
I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me. <+++++> She does. From when you were a boy.
 <+++++> What did your wife get her?
You ask a lot of questions. <+++++> That's how you get to know someone. Did it hurt when you got it?
Good. It's supposed to be. <+++++> I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her. <+++++> Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
Well, how's your friend? <+++++> She's still dead.
I fooled them into thinking I was alone. <+++++> Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
Why are you following me? <+++++> I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just driving...
I'm sure Sim is looking for you. Just sit tight. I'll bring you back a pizza. <+++++> No cheese.
I'm a working stiff, pops. <+++++> Take a vacation. I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
Sure! <+++++> No. I'm serious about this.
I can't tell you. <+++++> You understand you're on trial for murder?
Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me. <+++++> Early 70's. I was away. Maidstone. Possibly Brixton.
Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good. <+++++> Was it reasonable?
I caught one, back there. <+++++> Caught one? You mean you got shot?
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir. <+++++> Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Elaine, we have to go back. <+++++> We can't go back. We had something very special, but it's all over.
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude. <+++++> Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want? <+++++> Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on... <+++++> You're going to stay here...?
I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you. <+++++> In all these years... Why couldn't I see how it wold turn out?
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me. <+++++> Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph. <+++++> Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like? Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
Call me Sonny-boy. <+++++> Sonny-boy, one word?
Buster. <+++++> Answer me a couple things?
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money? <+++++> Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
Fine. You want me to call your supervisor? <+++++> Please do. He's a lonely guy.
You've just said you signed it. <+++++> Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
That would hardly be proper. <+++++> 
Do they drug you? <+++++> Oh, come off it, man.
No, it hasn't. <+++++> Yes. [Beat] It has. Everything up 'till today is done. Everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs.
Veil nebula. <+++++> Who cares?
Thorfinn! You can't die! <+++++> I'm not frightened... of anything...
What d'you mean? <+++++> Nothin. Quit lookin' at me like that!
Got a half a tuna sandwich. <+++++> Same one you had yesterday?
Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy. <+++++> Hello, Mollie.
I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too -- <+++++> I thought only the best students were made assistants.
Good to see you. <+++++> Good to see you.
Don't worry, they have no idea where you are. <+++++> You sonÂofÂaÂbitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?
Eddie, what's <u>my</u> motivation? <+++++> Oh. Er... well you're the file clerk. You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
Tonight we marry. Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon. <+++++> Every ship but your four fastest, you mean.
I remember. The big tipper. <+++++> Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about.
No one's keeping him here. <+++++> Bullshit, Nick. And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
I'll be ready. <+++++> Yeah.
Hold on Â <+++++> You gotta believe me Â
Me, too. Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse. Have we fed them? Like raw steak or something? <+++++> The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night. Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart? <+++++> You switched the charts; you tell me.
Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much? <+++++> What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it!
Definitely old. <+++++> That's Itchy, alright. How many y'need?
The Rangers and DEA are heading out to the desert this morning. You gonna join 'em? <+++++> I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
They turned me loose from the state hospital. <+++++> Is that right? Are you going to be staying here long?
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora? <+++++> playfully shoves his hand away.
She'll never forgive me! <+++++> Bombs away!
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy. <+++++> Yes, I *have*!
Gino Marzzone. <+++++> Marzzone? As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman? <+++++> 
Listen, Scooter -- <+++++> No, you listen. We're partners now and even though I'm running the show for you, I'm still running the show.
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes... <+++++> You've got plenty of contacts.
It's okay, Stephen, I -- <+++++> -- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.
To land any closer would risk detection. <+++++> Mr. Sulu. Execute.
That's very considerate. <+++++> I'm always considerate- my mother taught me that.
 <+++++> I got to agree with that.
 <+++++> What kind of doubts?
I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water. <+++++> Somehow I feel safer in here.
This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful. <+++++> I will see what I can do.
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong. <+++++> If I break one you gonna shoot me?
I just mean... <+++++> Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, Tripp. But... ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?
I can't risk it. <+++++> You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man.
Yes, I knowÂbutÂ <+++++> What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
But you can't be sure! It's suicide. You have to come with us! <+++++> I can't!
What's happened to you? <+++++> The NLF has condemned you to death.
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp. <+++++> Thanks.
I'm not sure. We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation. <+++++> Anything happening in there, El?
IÂ I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's. Yours is coming out at the elbows. <+++++> I don't rate it.
How about the other one? His friend. <+++++> Just moved in with his girlfriend.
Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it. <+++++> I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
You won't find it because no such telegram exists. <+++++> Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried.
I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him? <+++++> I wish you wouldn't be so sarcastic about Ralph. He's the sweetest kid I know.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel. <+++++> When you could've found one in America.
C'mere. I want to talk to you. <+++++> Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right? <+++++> Right.
Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so. <+++++> A baby... and she isn't even married.
Guilty until proven innocent? <+++++> Mother and Father know best.
Don't tell me they're refueling... <+++++> Oxygenation...
... You saw her? <+++++> Yes. Yes, I have.
Don't even ask about your money. Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed. <+++++> Motherfuck a window, Radio Raheem is dead.
Not you too <+++++> It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
Fuuuuuck <+++++> Can your man handle that?
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship... <+++++> They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
Well... you see, the problem is -- <+++++> -- the problem is you're a big fake. You haven't got a clue what's wrong with that girl.
Extinguish? <+++++> Should we counsel fear -- or trust? Should we seek to destroy -- or to build?
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot. <+++++> I can... The question is, can you lie to your ex- husband?
I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way. <+++++> We're doing this for Ma.
Brad! Oh, Brad. <+++++> He's a lame dog, remember? But even he wouldn't want to see you like this.
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow. <+++++> Can you configure it?
Aiiee. More waiting? I don't know if I like this plan. <+++++> It will take the entire day, but he will begin to doubt himself.
Both of youse--shaddup. This is a place of business. <+++++> Tell 'em, Pop.
That's me, Sir. <+++++> Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley. We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
Nothing. Why are you doing this? I thought God didn't exist. <+++++> He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
They're varicose veins. It isn't leprosy. <+++++> I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow. Come on now, sit down and go on eating.
Sounds boring to me. <+++++> Don't come.
Recommended? <+++++> Must I speak to you in French?
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night? <+++++> ...Fine.
Let's go. <+++++> Wait a second. We can't go in like this. Look at this place, we gotta look fly. We gotta Mac out.
Look. I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you. Are we really "friends?" <+++++> Why not --
I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves. <+++++> How ill is he?
And old ladies? <+++++> -- Burn them.
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one? <+++++> Spike. For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
This is it -- 3B. Check it out. <+++++> Open up. I want to see.
She's got a... <+++++> Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
You know it's not like that -- <+++++> Do I?
<u>Where am I</u>? <+++++> You're on a boat. A fishing boat. Italian flag. We're out of Vietri. It's the cold that saved you. The water.
Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino. What the hell's a Nintendo? <+++++> Oh man, you still got a thing for those unmasculine European coffees? Who's your buddy?
You feel sorry for the husband? <+++++> [Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]
So? <+++++> Stand back.
Wasted? <+++++> Charlie? !
What "revenge" is he talking about? <+++++> 
Nice weed, huh? <+++++> Fuck yeah. I never seen nothing like it. I'm fucking wasted.
...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal. <+++++> ...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.
Our plan is to hit them as they leave. <+++++> While they're strung out?
You're not going unless your sister goes. End of story. <+++++> Fine. I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house. I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway... <+++++> How do you mean that?
I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick. <+++++> Chick was outright killed by a mob.
That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again. <+++++> But you don't understand. There's this girl he's gotten pregnant and she's putting him through hell, sir.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square. <+++++> Yeah, yeah, yeah. You remember?
Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves. <+++++> When I told her I was going to bring her father, she kind of melted.
That is not a human decision, not your or mine. <+++++> What do you mean?
I'm looking for them. <+++++> Where?
Okay. <+++++> Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
Are they true! <+++++> NO! !
No? What do you mean 'no'? <+++++> No.
Does Webb not even know we are besieged? <+++++> Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements!
No. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened. <+++++> Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors. She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society. <+++++> Could it be intelligent?
Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please? <+++++> They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
So? <+++++> Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern? They were wedged in tight. They couldn't get a grip on them.
I've just been so busy, Lisa. <+++++> He has to go.
I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave. Am I forgiven for sending for you? <+++++> Forgiven. You know, when we were on that plane, I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it.
Is that the mail? <+++++> Yeah.
It doesn't matter. He was there and he let it happen. He can't take us in. <+++++> Give him the money.
They came back? <+++++> No.
...uh, drifting around like the trash you are, or were you here workin'? <+++++> If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
Um-m, well... <+++++> Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in. <+++++> Bob?
My lawyer, Tom Hagen. He arranged this all through your man Turnbull. <+++++> I thought we would meet alone.
He needs that regimented thing that prison provides -- <+++++> -- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you? <+++++> Sure. How much does the job pay? Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
We have plums in the orchard. We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth. <+++++> Thank you.
Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course. <+++++> We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
I sit. I think. I play games. <+++++> What kind of games?
Let's get out of here. <+++++> Did you see them run!
No, no. Just worrying about my boys -- as usual. <+++++> Let me tell you something about boys. They're like weeds. They grow best when they're ignored.
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane. <+++++> And our World will do the Time Warp again.
I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing Â apple core. <+++++> Apple core?
Gotta be in person. <+++++> Oh.
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there? <+++++> You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
Man, I can't wait for you to be dead. <+++++> Bear, you're not really gonna Â-
I never touched her. My mother's gr... <+++++> And a <u>fantasy</u> object...
My nerves are being torn apart. All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind. <+++++> I haven't done anything, Norma.
Shouldn't we wait for the others? <+++++> Careful, it's slippery. I had it waxed.
No -- <+++++> Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
You take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have... <+++++> Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
Cancer. It was the cigarettes. Right? The cigarettes? <+++++> Yeah, lung cancer. Ten years ago.
Oh Jesus Christ... <+++++> So I want the money and I want it now.
Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him. <+++++> What's that got to do with it?
Lucky man. <+++++> Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
I hope it wasn't cheap. <+++++> Oh, it was.
It doesn't matter how. I was driving a stolen car-- <+++++> Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
How much you pay me for my help? <+++++> I think it's more complicated than that little man.
This is a mistake. <+++++> He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
If you want... I can take you back to town now. <+++++> I ain't in a hurry.
 <+++++> He said he was dissatisfied... and was going back.
How old are you? <+++++> Nineteen... or thereabouts...
You considered becoming a prostitute? <+++++> Yes, I considered it.
What do you want? You must desire it for me to weave it. <+++++> Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man...
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes. <+++++> Excuse me Miss Daniel?
What the hell's going on? <+++++> I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.
Wait a minute, Major. "OPE," that's the recall code. Where would they get that? <+++++> You tell me.
Where..? Who . . .? I'm alive. You brought me back. <+++++> Obviously so.
Yes. <+++++> Huh?
Start it. <+++++> I can't...
Why not just steal another one? <+++++> Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
Shit, Earl. It's Ted Holster. <+++++> You dumb son of a bitch, you said you saw Myers.
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!! ! <+++++> DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
Military marching bands. <+++++> You think I'm rich and you hate me.
Yes! <+++++> Why?
Really? So, so, what else? Wh- what are you up to? <+++++> Oh, I don't know. My unemployment checks are running out.
Let's not. <+++++> I want a tape.
You can count on the truth from people who don't like you. <+++++> You have a helluva way of asking for help.
Did you hear that click? <+++++> Yes -- I think so. Another crossed line?
Who is it? <+++++> A friend of your fiance's.
It makes us feel a whole lot better. <+++++> That's what I thought he said.
Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back. <+++++> Ha! Go back! What a great line!
There are some people I'd like you to meet. Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock? <+++++> ... All right.
I never said that I believed... <+++++> 
Walter. <+++++> Do you have many friends?
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you. <+++++> Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
Aaaww, shit!... evil woman! <+++++> Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.
Why does that bother you? <+++++> I'm not sure why. It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
You asked if there was anything more you could help me with. <+++++> When?
That's cute. You're funny. <+++++> That's funny, you're cute.
You've quarreled and now you're going to be friends again. And that is as it should be. Never let any stupid misunderstandings come between you. <+++++> But it was really my fault.
I know it's not. <+++++> You don't even know his name.
Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi? <+++++> May<u>be</u>.
Where'd you get it? <+++++> Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too. <+++++> This town sucks.
Forget his reputation. Do you think we've got a plan or not? <+++++> Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
Nope. <+++++> You.
Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you. <+++++> I'm not sick.
They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  First time shooting up? <+++++> Nah...
Excuse me, but how old are you? <+++++> Twenty-six.
Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes. But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while. <+++++> Okay. What's the second thing?
We're getting everyone together as fast as we can. <+++++> What does the letter say?
A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine. <+++++> Well spoke. True to the mark. And if it's wine you're wanting, it's wine we shall have.
The Bruce is not coming, William. <+++++> Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these. <+++++> Fire insurance!
Yeah. Great, isn't it? <+++++> Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.
But I can't leave with you. I won't make it. <+++++> Maybe you can.
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them. <+++++> What...? Oh.
Are you alright...? You look pale. <+++++> I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health. I'm the doctor.
I'm Helen Tasker. Harry's my husband. And you are? <+++++> So now it's Tasker? Not Renquist?
They came here ÂÂbroke open the tombs and despoiled the graves. <+++++> All the graves?
Who? <+++++> Me!
Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness. <+++++> The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.
Full of beans, ain't you? But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now... <+++++> Calculated risk. Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.
Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger? <+++++> The pimp-mobile? Just made a few after market modifications. Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
Won't you get in trouble...? <+++++> Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean. We could take a few days....
 <+++++> Find out is there <u>any</u> chance we can get some rain tomorrow, <u>will</u> you...?
I'm in the bath, mom. <+++++> Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
When? <+++++> As the trucks go.
Will you stay here with us for a long time? <+++++> I reckon if you want me to. I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise. <+++++> At the gallop!
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it. <+++++> No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
They're all in here. All the ones he killed. They're just children! We have to help them! <+++++> Come on! Why are we waiting?
I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man. <+++++> This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it? <+++++> That's where the what comes in.
For what? <+++++> A certain weakness.
Thanks, Mr. Gittes. <+++++> Call me Jake. Careful driving home, Curly.
Can you even imagine? Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess? <+++++> Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
I don't look too foolish? <+++++> Foolish?
He wants to kill US! <+++++> Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
Touche. <+++++> It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.
Perform? <+++++> You know.
I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.' <+++++> Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?
What's more interesting than boffing the girlscout? <+++++> Well, that's what we're <u>doing</u> here...
He treats you okay? <+++++> Okay.
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws. <+++++> Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight. Bright colors. Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning. <+++++> As you wish.
What happens now? <+++++> The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting Sire.
I don't care... Just get it over with. <+++++> Hurry... hurry... hurry.
He's out of the equation. Talk to me. <+++++> I'm about to blow the wall.
Homesick? It's only been two days! <+++++> We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
Red or white? <+++++> Both.
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally --- <+++++> -- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
Bye Mrs. Sennett. <+++++> Bye Ma.
Yeah, I'm here. <+++++> I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper. Tell him I'll call back.
Oh, come on, come on! <+++++> Jump in.
Yes. Is this David? <+++++> Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
The guy from near where Christie used to live? <+++++> No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
30 minutes ago you said we had him. What in hell's goin' on out there? <+++++> He had help.
Liz, I'm really sorry. The meeting went much longer than expected. <+++++> We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake. It's Easter! You promised, Jim.
Ellie, it was a formal party... <+++++> Excuse me! You went to a party with her?
I don't <u>think</u> so... <+++++> Well, then, you have insufficient information. I'm grateful for this opportunity to set you straight.
This wasn't in the plan. <+++++> I think he has his own plan, Uncle Lex.
Oh? <+++++> I... I...
I didn't ask him to come! It's like I said, Thelma, he just loves the chase. <+++++> Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
Walter-- <+++++> JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE SAPS!
Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it. <+++++> No. Please.
We don't know that. <+++++> Come on Booth! Look at these scumbags around us. Who's going to know what happened! Let's take it and get out of here!
Like hell. You know, if you fellows stuck together 'stead of letting them walk all over you, they might not try it. <+++++> Like hell they wouldn't.
I'm not easily shocked. <+++++> I get that impression.
It's not too late to show her you're sorry. <+++++> How?
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop? <+++++> Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
I think I should. 3000W? <+++++> That's right.
The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly satisfied. <+++++> Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never saw fifty dollars before. You could have bought him for six bits. Funny thing about Bingy.
We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them. <+++++> Fair enough. But Castro's on alert and we're flying attack planes over their sites, on the deck.
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel. <+++++> Much better.
You sure about that? <+++++> I'm sure.
 <+++++> You left me at the hospital.
You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money. Joe is just... around. <+++++> For how long? And why?
That thing is poisonous. <+++++> Extremely so. You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow.
Not his style. <+++++> Katie was digitized.
Hi! Star. <+++++> Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
Okay. <+++++> Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night?
I was the kids' godfather. <+++++> And...?
I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . . <+++++> But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
He's from... Ohio... My cousin. <+++++> We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different. Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush. <+++++> Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant. And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty. Dismissed.
How do I know you're not lying. <+++++> Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
Jesus! <+++++> It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
See? She doesn't have one either -  You don't? <+++++> We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
I don't know! <+++++> ...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
IÂll send someone out. <+++++> Could...could you come?
What is it? <+++++> Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
I don't know. <+++++> I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
Oh. <+++++> It was my decision, not his.
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story? <+++++> What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
Let him have it. You're winning anyway. It doesn't make any difference. <+++++> I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that. <+++++> Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
C'mon -- <+++++> Top shelf, is it?
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo -- <+++++> I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
You've a touch of the poet, too; perhaps you should take up the quill. <+++++> Do I have your word?
Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it. Nice drinkin' liquor. <+++++> Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day. <+++++> That's it, I'm goin'...
Commander. <+++++> Sorry, sir. There is too much interference in the planet's ionosphere for an accurate reading.
Are you crazy, you'll get stung! ! <+++++> You're right, let's knock it down.
Okay, Phyllis, what's up? <+++++> Kramer...
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered. <+++++> Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
Who? Who is? <+++++> You, Vince! You! You are! You're a crock! You're a walking, talking crock!...
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you... <+++++> I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
Area code 212-555-0199. <+++++> I'll call you then.
What's C.R.S. ? <+++++> Consumer Recreation Services. It's their building. They...
Charlie! I said, what time is it? <+++++> Half past eleven.
Dr. Crowe? <+++++> Yes.
Is the hospital covered? <+++++> The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time. What about the hit list.
I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week. <+++++> And you've no idea where he went?
Maybe the demons are real. <+++++> Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
That sound good, boss. <+++++> ... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles. <+++++> Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
You want us to get ourselves killed? <+++++> From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman. There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it.
Of course. <+++++> Thank you.
Just a minute, you! <+++++> Yeah?
Yeah. And I thought everyone liked Eddie. <+++++> Who?
Nobody gonna come lookin' for it. I got the pinks... got no problem. Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus. <+++++> Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned... <+++++> What are you saying?
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much. <+++++> Kris Kristofferson.
Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>? <+++++> General Formica won't let me die out here. I'm his fiancee.
No! No -- no! Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto. <+++++> That's a good little girl. I knew you'd see reason.
How about a pedicure as long as you're down there. What's this? Lo-Jack? <+++++> Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting.
Aaagh! <+++++> Got you!
Thank you, Exposition. <+++++> Oh, and Austin...
She's buried. <+++++> I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
Me, too. You have a paperclip? <+++++> Paperclip?
Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three... <+++++> Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
I trust...  Want to see what I trust... In God we trust... The word's on every bill!! ! <+++++> You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me.
What? <+++++> Nerves.
Hal, is there anything bothering you? Anything that might account for this problem? <+++++> 
What is this business with you and explosives? Do you think you're immune? <+++++> I promise you that was the right thing to do. He's my good luck. Now cut. This one. I hope we don't die.
Mister LaPlante... <+++++> Do I hit anybody? You see me shoot anybody? Hey, drugs! Do I sell drugs? Jesus, I don't belong in prison.
What does it want? <+++++> I don't know. Something. Anything.
That's impossible. I'm a doctor, I'm -- <+++++> And I'll be a visitor.
And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it. <+++++> Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
Walter. This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors. In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge? <+++++> God isn't there to do it.
Where've you been? <+++++> Rabbit hunting.
They're not usually graduate students. <+++++> SWAT wants to go in.
Where's Ricky? <+++++> Ricky's taken care of.
Yeah. Come onÂcome on! <+++++> Oh, excuse me. I was just tryin'Âyou knowÂto make things pleasant.
A half-a-million dollars will always be missed. <+++++> You're avoiding the question.
Yes. <+++++> Where does it lead?
He'd kill me. He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is. <+++++> Or was. We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
Just make something up. Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months. The whole thing is under control. <+++++> You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
It's an unusual trade. <+++++> Yes it is.
The Wizard of Oz? Is he good or is he wicked? <+++++> Oh, very good, but very mysterious. He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here.
Why were you so careless? <+++++> I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally?
You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy. <+++++> Get out!
There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses. <+++++> Flew?! Oh, come on Benny...
You are bad. You are a bad person. you are a bad person and you have no right to take people's confidence in your service -- <+++++> You better watch your mouth, cunt, you're gonna get hurt.
Scared of a girl? <+++++> Scared to make a mistake. Supposing she's right... supposing she really has been sent by God? ?
What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>? Have I ever... ever pressured you! ? <+++++> No.
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me. <+++++> Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener?
So what's it going to be, Coogan's or U Vayvudoo? <+++++> I don't care. I'm not staying out late Doug.
Can you borrow me a dime? <+++++> Sorry, buddy, I'm clean outta change...
I am seventy-four years old. <+++++> Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself. <+++++> I think I heard about that.
Is that you down there? <+++++> Shit! Yeah, Grandma. Me and the squad.
Or somebody stopped them. <+++++> Either way, they must've had a pretty good reason.
Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood. <+++++> 
That bugger moves fast. <+++++> Give me a 400-foot magazine;  we may be down there for a while.
Yeah, that one. <+++++> That one.
They make my eyes itch. <+++++> Don't worry. I won't make you do it alone. I know all the right places. I'm a member at all the right clubs .
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation. <+++++> Oh?
 <+++++> If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
Who is it? <+++++> Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.
Talk from there. You can talk from there. <+++++> In private. They got cameras and alla that crap in there. Microphones.
I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win. <+++++> Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
Seltzer? <+++++> Want some?
He thinks they're what? <+++++> In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.
You're lucky, boy. You come home, and nobody's here. When I go home, everybody's going to be there. <+++++> This room is full of ghosts.
They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart. <+++++> Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
Him? Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board. <+++++> Yeah, everybody thought so. But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons. All Toons. We couldn't see the bad in 'em.
Excuse me, Wichita, I can't seem to reach the top shelf in the storage room. Could you... <+++++> Not now, Wendy.
What's that? <+++++> A statistical phenomenon. Says everything in the world goes in streaks.
You're not marriage material. You're not even boyfriend material. You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid. <+++++> I'm not a kid.
I can't find my ball. <+++++> Can you see it?
It's Saturday. <+++++> You got in late last night.
I had a great time last night. Again. <+++++> Me too.
He wants to shut down the storage grid. <+++++> If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now! <+++++> Ten seconds....
He was trying to kill me, not you. <+++++> Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what? Six hours?
Original. <+++++> Give -- me -- your -- hand!
How's it look? <+++++> Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
Was I in an accident? <+++++> No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
Sweetheart, no. Don't be ridiculous. <+++++> Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
Yes, but we're just singing. <+++++> Sue was trying to get hold of you.
Don't tell Elaine. <+++++> Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
And you haven't made an ounce of progress. <+++++> I know.
Yes, I'll do it. Just leave my family alone. <+++++> Good. Good.
Firing range, sir. <+++++> 
Don't worry. I wasn't missed. The only important man here is the owner. <+++++> Mr. Holland?
Like the guys that attacked us. <+++++> What do you mean?
How are you holding up? <+++++> Well...
You'll have it. <+++++> But not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing cops, and not horse shit paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs.
Double scoops? <+++++> Double scoops. Now lets get some breakfast.
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do. <+++++> Where you been, Harry?
Yes. <+++++> I want to talk to you.
Go back to Bulgaria. <+++++> Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out!
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open? <+++++> Honest, Mr, Charles. I never touched that safe. Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
Excuse me? <+++++> Several possession charges, but nothing major.
Melanie must be dyin' to see it. Louis. <+++++> That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
I'm sorry, Claudia. <+++++> What is it? Did you forget something?
...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons,  and we're... <+++++> ...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar! And let me tell you something else.
Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore. You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife? <+++++> She's coming, Omar, she's coming--
Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door. <+++++> You want me to come with?
Pack, Wladek, there's no time. <+++++> I'm not going anywhere.
Here we go. <+++++> Wait a second --
 <+++++> You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
God help you, Lynette! <+++++> You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff? <+++++> * John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with.
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving. <+++++> You're breaking my heart. Got to see a man about a dog.
You're sometimes not sure? <+++++> I'm sure. Pretty sure.
Alice got married again. <+++++> She did?
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you? <+++++> Mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow...
Make it five. <+++++> Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
Morning. <+++++> Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home. <+++++> God forbid!
This is not very good, is it? <+++++> No.
So that was why she tried to run away. <+++++> Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
What about the aftermath? This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory? <+++++> We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the... <+++++> No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch."
Never. <+++++> The fastest.
God, you're a slob. <+++++> But a fabulous cook.
Sir, I've always wondered... Why <u>Sue</u>? You could have any woman in the world but -- <+++++> <u>That's</u> why.
- none taken - <+++++> - wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
Jesus, I don't know if I can get away. I've got a client waiting. I'd have to do some heavy duty juggling. <+++++> Then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here.
Like, that last "Francis the Mule" picture -- it got <u>terrible</u> notices. But it was a huge hit. <+++++> Lines around the block.
Good. <+++++> Thanks.
You're NOT DYING! <+++++> Okay. You're probably right.
Vegetable meaning paraplegic. <+++++> They put up the least amount of struggle.
And cigarettes. I smoke, too. <+++++> You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.
What? <+++++> I'm just not ready to go home quite yet, that's all.
Well, here we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of like one of those documentaries on educational TV? <+++++> It's nice here. It's different.
Tommy! The guy's a sleaze-bag. She can't sing. <+++++> I don't think she can sing, either.
A bit less florid, Data. <+++++> Aye, sir... This way.
What you do, boy? You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep. <+++++> I didn't know... I --
Talking. <+++++> About what?
Yeah. <+++++> Okay, how much time do you need?
If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come. Got a toothpick? <+++++> No. But I've got a penknife.
What's it going to be, Elizabeth? SeventyÂfive? Eighty? <+++++> I'm not telling.
Where's Adele? <+++++> She wasn't feeling so good.
You must have me confused withÂ <+++++> Quit kidding!
It is vulnerable and endearing. And that is annoying as shit. <+++++> You like her.
Where'd you find them? <+++++> They were walking along the fence past the soccer field. Said they were curious about the school so I invited them to the meeting.
I'm sorry, Momma. Maybe next time. <+++++> I don't want you meeting around that house. You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
This one could seduce the devil. A body! and eyes as big and black as olives. <+++++> I know about what you mean!
Why? <+++++> How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
It's not that, it's just that... It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything. <+++++> You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised -- <+++++> Who? !
Sure you don't want any salad? <+++++> No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
Jesus... <+++++> Get back in the car!
In a lake. <+++++> I might have known. As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling? <+++++> They didn't, they buried him at the foot of Anubis. He was either someone of great importance. Or he did something very naughty.
There ain't a better insideman alive. He'll teach ya everything ya gotta know. <+++++> You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do. <+++++> The keys. She took the keys.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior. <+++++> Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried... <+++++> You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific! <+++++> I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you. <+++++> Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
"Pack Up Your Troubles." <+++++> Are we leaving, Captain?
Go home, Walter. <+++++> Now I know. It's when I can see a girl, be near a girl, even talk to a girl... and walk away.
I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself. <+++++> Would it make you anymore amusing?
Oh yeah. <+++++> Just do me a favor. Think about what this is costing everybody. Not just the railroad.
Open your door. <+++++> What? What for?
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls. <+++++> Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...
She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive. <+++++> But you knew this was important to me.
You see, it's not a dream. <+++++> You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set. <+++++> Why are you so hostile?
They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means? <+++++> Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.
Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office? <+++++> Listen to me! The young man in there...
It will be a good harvest this year. <+++++> Can you really tell from doing that?
Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags! <+++++> There might be some extras in the garage.
Well, I don't... <+++++> I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
I heard you weren't coming. <+++++> We changed our minds.
Like Joey? Are you afraid to mention his name? <+++++> Why keep harpin' on it? Come on, drink up. You got to get a little fun out of life.
No, sir... <+++++> I asked for the man in charge...
A million dollars. <+++++> Million point two.
It's so dirty. <+++++> Nah. The girls sponge off between johns.
...People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are? <+++++> Yes, your honor.
You can believe that if you want to. <+++++> Well, I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now, above a saloon, it's true, but... walk up a flight.
You people...rich people... <+++++> I'm not rich people.
No, Dad. <+++++> Are you sure?
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday. <+++++> You stole it?
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby? <+++++> Sure.
I'll make the arrangements. <+++++> At least it's over...
And is Foley a part of this? <+++++> He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks. <+++++> What are we going to do?
This is Doyle, Jeff. <+++++> Tom, I've got something real big for you.
Do we need him? <+++++> The green-and-whites saw us. One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there? Ties it to the break and turns around...
- See, what you can do for him --... <+++++> Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
 <+++++> [Within] Juliet!
Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks. <+++++> Humpbacked - people. ?
Looks like you'd make a good runner. <+++++> Well.
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone. <+++++> As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.
So I can get my job back. <+++++> Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
You stay with me. <+++++> Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
Uh huh. Okay, enough practice. <+++++> Close your eyes.
You see the paper? <+++++> I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
An honest living. <+++++> So anyway, he says, 'whyn't you do what the Chinese do?'
Just one daughter. <+++++> Hey <u>you've</u> been on Saturn! I <u>hate</u> those sandworms!
I would cherish you--and stay sober. <+++++> Diz, you're a swell playmate--but--.
Give it up. <+++++> Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy. <+++++> Oh? And what's that?
Professor, be serious, would you? <+++++> I am serious.
That bothers you? <+++++> Yeah, maybe, a little.
You're sure? <+++++> Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters. <+++++> What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
You'll have to find that out, won't you. <+++++> The slush fund at CREEP financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so--
Let's talk about that. I'm looking for some men. <+++++> I've given that up.
What, you're saying she was overwrought. <+++++> That could be.
So what? <+++++> Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'.
I don't want to. Don't need to. I love you. <+++++> You don't ever think about other people?
You're not from around here, are you? <+++++> Why you say that? Just because I help a lady with her package?
We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets. <+++++> Don't you want dinner first?
NO, but I will lock you in. <+++++> What?
Well... <+++++> These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
I don't believe it. <+++++> I swear to you, it's true...
Newspaperman? <+++++> Wants to know who the heir is.
What are you doing? <+++++> Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
Nice car. Yours? <+++++> No.
Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking! <+++++> Yep.
Are they still operative? <+++++> Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, IÂd watch my step.
I'd slap his face. <+++++> I'd kick him in the nuts, if I thought he had any.
I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of. <+++++> You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
I don't know. Big. Dark. <+++++> He's gone. Did you get a license plate? Or a make?
What is it? <+++++> Power line.
No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer -- <+++++> C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message. <+++++> That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
No. <+++++> You're free to go to her, if you want. If you'd rather be a woman and run with the women, just say the word.
Some of 'em. <+++++> Can I open 'em up?
Psychiatrists make you nervous? <+++++> Just ones this beautiful.
With pay! She is out the door. <+++++> You'll get it, Babe. You'll get it.
No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that. <+++++> Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son
And what? <+++++> Did you?
We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know... <+++++> Right -
Wait. I think we understand each other. <+++++> We have no understanding.
Where are you going? <+++++> Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
Where you from? <+++++> What is this?
There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor. <+++++> I don't know if I can do that without a...
I wish to be your husband. <+++++> I wish to be your wife.
My wife wears a seven. You don't look like a seven to me. <+++++> I wear a seven.
I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you. <+++++> Are we?
The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced... <+++++> That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
How? <+++++> You never disappointed me.
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate. <+++++> Wow.
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address. <+++++> Well--that's very fine. Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt. <+++++> Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece. <+++++> No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
I have a headache. You have a headache? <+++++> No, I don't have one.
They're calling me in to work. <+++++> I should be going anyway.
But how can you say that? <+++++> They're mesmerising.
And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars. <+++++> For what cause?
Dylan's been telling people that Annette gave him a blow job. <+++++> And she didn't?
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter. <+++++> Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us. <+++++> You don't know how to hotwire.
So? <+++++> 
Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs. <+++++> Oh yeah!
You don't have to make any decisions tonight. <+++++> But what am I going to do?
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals. <+++++> You need healthy, natural sleep. Chew valerian root and get some more exercise.
Do what? <+++++> Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.
So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight. <+++++> She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
Ssshh! What was that? <+++++> Let's find out.
Too much... too fast...? <+++++> Mm-hmm. Scared-  I feel a little like the moth and the flame.
The family know? <+++++> I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room.
It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go. <+++++> Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
They were simple songs. <+++++> Not for me. I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that? Otherwise, I forget. I just forget. But you.
People say that? <+++++> Forget it. I was joking.
What are you saying? <+++++> You need company, Louis. More congenial than mine...
So, how long you've been living here? <+++++> Long. You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
It came my way. 450 a week. <+++++> 450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
You here for the summer? <+++++> Some friends and me took a house.
Give me your hand and we both live. <+++++> 
Give me your gun... <+++++> ...<u>what</u>...?
Really? A girlfriend then? <+++++> No. Perhaps I work too much.
Shh . . . ! I'll wait for you upstairs. <+++++> All right, dear.
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra. <+++++> Huh?
If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once -- <+++++> Then take the pills.
My God... these people are insane. <+++++> Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy. <+++++> Don't curse.
No. <+++++> Good. So let's go...
You're sure? ! <+++++> Relatively.
It's his nature. <+++++> But what if he doesn't --
This is a complicated case, your Honor... <+++++> I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something.
Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives. <+++++> So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
Carter, get off that stage! <+++++> Are you kidding, they love me. I'm a star, Lee. A god to these people!
I can't. <+++++> For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
Comin' in or goin' out? <+++++> Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.
I thought I would kill you. You killed my friends, you ruined my hands. But the girl was always here, like some Guardian Angel. <+++++> You can't kill me. I died years ago.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that. <+++++> I know.
So I can go over there and pick up your things. <+++++> No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
I'll go in right now and get that eye. <+++++> Then do it.
Do you want anything? <+++++> Maybe an orange juice.
No, no, no, no no... You need to go now. <+++++> What did I say?
I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves. <+++++> Avocado groves?
I'd eat a lot of red meat. <+++++> Good for you.
You and your husband never discussed her? <+++++> He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name. We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
Hey man, you can't do that! <+++++> What? This?
And the world -- the whole world. <+++++> -- Burn it all.
This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways. <+++++> You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at. But I already knew you could make me laugh.
Jeffrey, when you see your father. <+++++> Yeah?
Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's  inside the station. <+++++> And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it? <+++++> Listen to this. A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning.
My family lives in Miami. Because of the death threats. <+++++> It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?" <+++++> And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
Think about it. <+++++> Yeah, sure.
I don't know. <+++++> Matthew.
You're kidding. <+++++> They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.
For Christ's sake, Violet! I heard you! Thin walls, remember? <+++++> What you heard wasn't sex.
A heck of a lot. What'd you say you were gonna put there? <+++++> lot. It's a limited -
Bruce Wayne was something I inherited. All I ever hoped for was someone who could see through Bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened. <+++++> I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
My, God! What have you done to him? <+++++> I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it. Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer. <+++++> I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace. Really.
Kkinsa, open the goddamn door! <+++++> Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.
Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers. <+++++> Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me-- <+++++> They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
It looks like we're too late. <+++++> There are no other ships in the system.
She was stealing. <+++++> But she's colored.
I'm your son. I'm you. <+++++> Sean, wait...
Huh? <+++++> That's the name for when you wake up and find this little pool of sticky stuff, like after a sexy dream.
I don't know. If this one's any faster than that other one... <+++++> I think we wait right here.
He's a jerk. <+++++> Yes. He is.
Thank you, sir. <+++++> Would you care for a beverage? Tea?
Can you get it? <+++++> The Russian would be easier.
You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo. <+++++> What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you want. <+++++> See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.
How do I leave here? <+++++> The front door is open. Will you be back?
I don't know... I like the Army. <+++++> C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
What was it like? <+++++> I said, `I'm dead'. He killed me.
One week old. <+++++> Congratulations.
I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th. <+++++> Are you kidding? We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th. I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth.
Yeah, you are. I can tell by the way you look at me. <+++++> I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices. You know, the police are looking for you.
But -- why? <+++++> Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body.
No. No. <+++++> You're my Olympic event.
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart. <+++++> Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back? <+++++> Come on, Myra, don't talk business here. This is time out.
Yeah, that's pretty much it. <+++++> I thought so. Because, one time? I was at this --
I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship. <+++++> It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.
Can't we come with you? <+++++> Nobody sees where I get the stuff. That's good business. I'll be back in thirty minutes.
No you don't. Did you see the woman in the red dress? <+++++> Yeah.
All right, then tell me how - <+++++> No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island.
How would you rate this one? <+++++> Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good. This is the new one, right, Chris?
Stay away...! <+++++> Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you. You didn't let me finish my sentence.
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints? <+++++> I don't know.
Well, i-if-if you have some free time... <+++++> Yeah, sure.
We still don't know that it's the plague ÂÂ <+++++> Dr. Drossos will tell us. We will know what to do then.
I told you I slept with him. <+++++> No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there? <+++++> Lucky, I guess.
What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths. <+++++> I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying.
Uh-huh. <+++++> I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
I sent for  the police. We can explain. <+++++> Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away. <+++++> Or didn't. There's no way of knowing, is there?
Is he here in Borderdale? <+++++> I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team... <+++++> Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us.
Yes, sir. <+++++> You try it.
Oh, nothing much. You know... <+++++> Well...
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic. <+++++> Doesn't sound free to me. So you want me to pay for it?
Oh dear....easy honey... <+++++> Ninety-five miles an hour...
I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow? <+++++> No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's.
How they goin', kid? <+++++> Not bad.
At least once a week. <+++++> And you like that?
Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew? <+++++> Cut me open. Find out.
CRIMINAL <+++++> SIN-I-FUL
Apparently I can disappear. <+++++> <u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up? <+++++> I wouldn't bet against it. My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
All right, but... <+++++> But don't you <u>do</u> anything. You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
I am stronger than you, Highlander. <+++++> That's what the Kurgan said.
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you? <+++++> You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
Mom, do you miss Dad? <+++++> Sometimes. But, just when I think your father's changing for the better, I realize he's as self absorbed as ever.
Don't worry about it. <+++++> There are cops all over the place.
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card. <+++++> ... What? ?
Are you alright? <+++++> ....I don't know.
What? <+++++> Where you lived with them.
What is it you want? <+++++> Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.
And what do you want for Christmas? <+++++> Just you.
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how... <+++++> I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right? <+++++> No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher.
...and Abby. Maybe. But as far as I'm concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility. <+++++> What's that?
Why didn't you go? <+++++> Too old.
Where's your bike? <+++++> Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
Three's a crowd, especially if you've got to cut your way through barbed wire. Here's the wire cutters. Are the civilian clothes ready? <+++++> Coming up.
I see. <+++++> Have we got a play, Anne? Oh, have we got a play! Of course most of it is Gallagher's.
Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud! <+++++> I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
How we doin' on that vehicle? <+++++> No motels registered any tan Ciera last night.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards. <+++++> Well, I've not brought them.
What are you afraid of? Turn it on. <+++++> Impossible. Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.
You know, clean the pipes. <+++++> Pipes? What are you talking about?
You are not in a band, Barry. You are not a musician. And no posters. <+++++> Thanks for your support, Rob. Really appreciate it.
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out. <+++++> Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved. <+++++> I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage. <+++++> But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
Everything all right. <+++++> Huh-huh. You?
Diane! Alright, let's stop this right now. Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous. This isn't even smart thinking. <+++++> Dad, why are you acting this way? Is this because of the other morning?
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one. <+++++> Looks like Tim Kobza.
We had a bargain. You promised. <+++++> I lied.
Want one? <+++++> I don't drink beer.
I don't know. Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun. <+++++> Boy, are you ever a shitty judge of people.
What is it, a still life? <+++++> No, not exactly. Want to see?
No, I mean - about my client. <+++++> Oh - we'll have to do something about the common wife.
I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl. <+++++> There's only one I want.
You wouldn't shoot anyone... <+++++> But I would.
Where are you going? <+++++> I'm going to Canada but I can let you ride with me up to the border.
If someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again. <+++++> Yes.
With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now. <+++++> It'd be for your own good. I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book. ...
You sure you want to throw that card? <+++++> Sure.
It sounds stupid. <+++++> Nevermind.
Yeah... great. <+++++> You know... you could say thank you.
That doesn't bother me. <+++++> You think this is funny?
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating. End of discussion. <+++++> What if she never starts dating?
Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless. Unblinking in his prejudice. <+++++> It was obvious from the way he first looked at me.
I'm tryin' to find my jacket. <+++++> Look in the hamper. Linda's been dumpin' everybody's stray clothes there lately.
Y'all come back. <+++++> Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
They knew of you. Now they know you. <+++++> Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know?
No thanks. <+++++> I think that's it.
Trust me. I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply? How much can we get? <+++++> Don't worry. We will talk of everything. We have the time.
The deflector shields are gone. <+++++> Are the coordinates set?
He's back, Col <+++++> Hi.
Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, I'm going to have to bring you up here to New York. <+++++> Thanks. I just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds.
Mister, can you visit anybody here? <+++++> Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should... <+++++> Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him... <+++++> I saw him leaving wearing it.
Please, Uncle Al. <+++++> Will you?
Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word. <+++++> Certainly!
Um. Happy for you. <+++++> Thanks.
I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go. <+++++> This time you gotta go.
Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since. <+++++> I'm at sea, Jason.
I'm going ashore to take a look around the island. There are some ruins up there... <+++++> There too...
Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name. <+++++> Teddy!
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again. <+++++> Despite all your talents, you are still a novice in the ways of family.
Oh, leave off!! ! <+++++> Temper! Temper!
He's a pretty tough old man, huh? <+++++> No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
No. I told him to. I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end. <+++++> But we heard him.
And I, personally, would not care to refer them to--to-- <+++++> To M'sieu Laval?
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself. <+++++> I've never lied to you. I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are. <+++++> But an Oracle can.
Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention. <+++++> He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
You know how your Daddy is. <+++++> If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself. <+++++> -- I do not accept excuses. I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
Black market? <+++++> Same thing. Ya know, Rock, remember when we was kids, we fought together.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey. <+++++> Say "goodnight" to Sandy.
...don't feel like it either. <+++++> ...beautiful night.
Don't play games with me, Ted. <+++++> I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
You a mini-golfer? <+++++> Nope.
He's not here. <+++++> Oh.
Long enough. <+++++> "For"...?
You think I don't know that? <+++++> We're lost!
No, not at all. <+++++> Well she must've packed on a few pounds over the years.
Sir-- <+++++> Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
She had the same. <+++++> Okay.
Koko, why don't you let one of these Newmeats take your broom for today? <+++++> Hell, no. I ain't goin' down in the ditch.
Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money. <+++++> Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water. <+++++> Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed. She's even more beautiful than I remember.
I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow. <+++++> That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
Long ago -- before my father's father. <+++++> And it had three lines painted across it? The lines represent the three levels of the universe. I've seen stones like the one you lost.
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart. <+++++> I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
The police have the poor unfortunate lad in the Bridewell. <+++++> The police station.
I've been knocking. The door was open. Is everything all right in here? <+++++> Who are you?
Talk what? I do not know anything! <+++++> How many do you want? A thousand?
...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear? <+++++> Pretty well.
My parents wanted me here all along but my grades weren't good enough. I had to go to Balincrest to pull them up. <+++++> Well, you've won the booby prize. Don't expect to like it here.
Join us, Commanders. Now what's the disposition of the fleet? <+++++> They're holding position.
I know. I know. <+++++> I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?
You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum. <+++++> Who's the subject?
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet? <+++++> Why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?
I have cheerleading squad. <+++++> Skip it.
Why, I'm assisting you, sir. <+++++> Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
Did we win or lose, I mean --? <+++++> I don't know, Richard, they need to talk it over --
You have an emergency call on your private line. <+++++> Thank you. This is Burgess.
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on. <+++++> He left!
I tested positive? <+++++> I'm sorry.
The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible... <+++++> There are caves in those mountains.
Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight. <+++++> Why would you do that?
Harlan. <+++++> What?! What about him? !
Uh-huh. <+++++> I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now watch . . . right on the second floor there.
I'll be back in a while. <+++++> I don't want to see you anymore.
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine. <+++++> Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
...to steal my girl. <+++++> Where is she?
What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life? <+++++> Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...
Are you nuts, walking into a gun? <+++++> You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.
I'm all ears. <+++++> Don't you have to finish the game ?
Yeah, we can. Least till after this weekend. He ain't going nowhere. We'll deal with it then. <+++++> Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here.
-- enough time tomorrow. I know. <+++++> Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.
I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all. <+++++> But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
Then you never loved me? <+++++> Love you? I loathe your bipedal arrogance, your animal superiority.
Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time. <+++++> That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank? What happens if I miss the train?
What was that, I didn't hear... <+++++> It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions? <+++++> Come on in.
You like this place? <+++++> It's very nice.
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run? <+++++> Because he thinks he's innocent.
I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him. <+++++> He was here?
Really? That's amazing. <+++++> Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
Why? <+++++> He was, like, a total babe
Make it plain. <+++++> And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you --
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s . <+++++> I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
Help me with this thing! <+++++> It's not the gas, Dad!
First you tell me. <+++++> Brilliantly moving.
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said... <+++++> And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
What happened? <+++++> After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.
Eventually. Does it have to be right now? <+++++> Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
Jews, yeah. Investors. <+++++> Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
No. <+++++> Just...try and go back to sleep.
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you? <+++++> Nope. Back then we did not.
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly? <+++++> Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
No. What I have is a lot of money. <+++++> I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing. Even the pension funds are stripped clean.
He made it, hunhh? <+++++> Yeah, but at what a price.
All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa. <+++++> The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
Some cream? <+++++> I'll get it.
No. <+++++> Really?
Are you drunk? <+++++> No. Are you drunk?
Goodnight. <+++++> Goodnight.
Let me explain something... <+++++> No. Wait! Did I say Promise! Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment? !
These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed. <+++++> I have a plan. If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
Man. Fuck you guys. I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical. <+++++> Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy.
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper. <+++++> Egad, were you horrified?
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden. <+++++> Ow! Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
It's okay. <+++++> And I had to widen a few doors. You'll see.
You show Claire these sketches? <+++++> Yes.
Us. <+++++> Of course.
Here you go... <+++++> YouÂre kidding me...
Fuck. <+++++> What do you think?
Show me Della! <+++++> Hey, I'm here.
What? Yeah. <+++++> Are you all right? You coming down with something?

You were good. <+++++> How do you know?
Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing. <+++++> I was getting to that!

So you think you can? <+++++> No. I'm sorry.
Mama? <+++++> Huh?
But he's one among some two hundred wards -- <+++++> Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?

Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have. <+++++> -- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
Rain. <+++++> Real rain?
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right? <+++++> Yeah. She told me. You walk her to school.
Who? <+++++> You.
Nope, there's no way. <+++++> Let's say... for instance...
What are you going to do, Sam? <+++++> I don't know. When I met my wife, it was so clear. I just <u>knew</u>.
They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me. <+++++> Yes. That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
Hi, Chief. You like the suicide? <+++++> Never reach out!
He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money. <+++++> Not this one. And not Mitchell.
Oh? <+++++> The charades.
I made it. <+++++> What are you going to do?
Signs? <+++++> Yeah -- like keep out --
Slow. <+++++> It's grandmother style.
Ten bucks. <+++++> What's it for?
I want to stop aging. <+++++> And I want Doucet.
Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight. <+++++> Then... I guess you have to.
I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense. <+++++> None taken. There are talkers and doers. I like doers.
Take your time. <+++++> Look, Colonel... we're all adults here. This is a war. A very quiet, very intense war. People get sacrificed.
You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling? <+++++> I don't know. I don't know.
Jesus Christ! <+++++> One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum." And it's playing like gangbusters.
Helena -- <+++++> We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents.
Not in my experience. <+++++> Off his wages.
It's not true. <+++++> Yes it is, Jake! Yes it is! They were right there for you. She was right there for you! Look at her!
You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead. <+++++> Is he working?
In a fire, as I recall. <+++++> Started he couldn't remember things? Got real violent?
Don't tell me what to do. <+++++> Leave.
Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them? <+++++> The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok? <+++++> Yeah, I'll be fine. Bye.
I don't know. That's why I'm asking you. <+++++> You must have some feeling. Some immediate impression. A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.
Otis you crazy dog! Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon? My people are very hungry. <+++++> 
Now listen... <+++++> No, no, let me go on before you get the wrong idea. Ann and I have kept to our separate bedrooms for the last three years.
Why not? <+++++> It's killing me.
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T... <+++++> An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
We're going to take you home. <+++++> That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
I've been using you? ! <+++++> You didn't know my father --
Of course, dear. <+++++> Aw, gee, Mom -- I had plans to play with Mr. Carpenter.
You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it? <+++++> I'm waiting till the time's right.
Don't you gamble? <+++++> Only make bets I can't afford to lose. Only way to be 100% committed.
That will not be necessary. You can simply speak to me. I understand most languages fluently. <+++++> Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
Are you busy tonight? <+++++> Yes.
You and the Colonel go back. <+++++> He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
I'm in the middle of it... <+++++> Turn if off!
How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day. <+++++> What's the matter?
We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. Nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'. <+++++> Thank you, Sergeant.
Oh Jesus. I'm going home. <+++++> Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin. <+++++> The taxi life, you mean.
I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...? <+++++> Miss, we are going to ask you to sign this little sheet of <u>paper</u>...
...then... <+++++> ...I only...
Are you from L.A.? <+++++> No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
Since when does... <+++++> ...Darlene pay you in cash?
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ... <+++++> Look, it's a longshot...
What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>? <+++++> Glenn, take the exit.
Your gun. <+++++> Mind your own business, Father.
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark. <+++++> Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.
--the lookout in the Motor Inn?--  --he say anything we don't know?-- <+++++> --just that a lot of reports were sent to CREEP, but he doesn't name who, not here anyway--
Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful. <+++++> For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
Sixteen <+++++> Live with your parents?
So they said more than the address. <+++++> No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
No. But he hands them over. <+++++> Kiss me. Before I cut. Just in case.
I didn't believe in what they were saying. Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying! <+++++> So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
That was for you again. He wants you to call him up as soon as you get back. <+++++> I don't know what's keeping me. I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition?
Not at all, sir. <+++++> Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing. <+++++> Enjoy.
They had to kill 'em? <+++++> Nah, they were dead-ass asleep. But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her. <+++++> Let me show you something, Ray.
You might still have a house. <+++++> I wish it could all have been different.
Unbelievable. Can you believe that, Violet? <+++++> Hey, Johnnie ...
No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever... <+++++> Just give me a chance, will you?
He didn't do it! <+++++> What?
How'd you get him to say yes? <+++++> I told him you looked like me.
 <+++++> And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
Oh, me - <+++++> How old did you say you were?
He didn't do you a favor. <+++++> Screw you!
Hey -- do you mind? <+++++> Not at all
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates... <+++++> Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
No, he's not with a girl. <+++++> Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun... <+++++> So Christ, call her up.
Anybody see them? <+++++> Activating Power Scope!
We chould be resting up. <+++++> Resting Up? Sorry Spooky, I've got to go with God on this one. I hate to think we're just in this for the money.
Still got him? <+++++> It's moving slow. About... eleven metres. On the left.
Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it." <+++++> That's right, sir. And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb. What if they start something?
It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes. <+++++> I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt. <+++++> Excuse me? Do I know you, friend? Take a look around you. Do you even know who I am?
But meant her moving here. <+++++> Closer to Japan. You're fast.
Thanks. Come on Chris, give me a hand. <+++++> I can't, I've got to split. I have to take a class at two o'clock.
Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello. <+++++> Hello.
What do you want? <+++++> My father's guilty. He lied to me, he lied to everybody. I just left home... I need you.
Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now". <+++++> Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?
So what are you going to do? <+++++> I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station.
Suit yourself. <+++++> Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
The Polacks? From Sacred Heart? <+++++> Nobody ever beat me up. Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons.
No, I will not step outside. <+++++> Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.
You don't like this, I take it? <+++++> Come on, you're prettier than that.
Absolutely-- <+++++> --what about you?--
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife. She's a good lady. I'm glad you got her back. <+++++> And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back. Think you'll keep it?
And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice. <+++++> Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
Are you crazy? I have no use for a woman! Since my accident. <+++++> No, no. Johana is visiting me.
It is, isn't it? It is your first time. <+++++> That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas. Grayson. <+++++> Where are you gitting these...? Aaron --- if it's a boy.
Better than you. <+++++> Hmm, I still owe him.
Oh, man. <+++++> We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
What? <+++++> 
I don't need a babyÂsitter. <+++++> What you need is a collar.
How much? <+++++> Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat! <+++++> Right.
Dan'l Webster is coming to my party. <+++++> Dan'l Webster?
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours? <+++++> There is nowhere else to keep it, and it's the last place they are going to look.
Gabe! <+++++> Hold on! Hold on! Reach up!
I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night. I never gave it a second thought. <+++++> I think Hemingway wrote somewhere...
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate. <+++++> So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself.
But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's... <+++++> Do you know the <u>seller</u>?
I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over. <+++++> Sure thing.
How'd you know I was in here? <+++++> The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.
What kind of band is this, anyway? <+++++> You got to be under twenty-five -
For a while. She left. <+++++> Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in.
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right? <+++++> Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name. <+++++> What's he look like?
But Your Honor-- <+++++> That's it, Mr. Dulaney. Take a seat.
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much? <+++++> See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car.
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe? <+++++> How much time do you have?
No question, huh? <+++++> No, its -- Why did she--?
Yes. <+++++> With how many people?
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl. <+++++> You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
Dick. <+++++> Exactly.
Wait. What about . . . him? <+++++> Put some clothes on him. When I get back We'll load him in the trunk and dump him in the desert.
Have you got the new pages on the Old Mill? Hey, Bob. <+++++> Hey, Tommy. Heard your wife's having a baby.
Excuse me. <+++++> What?
You're putting off the inevitable. <+++++> I'm putting it off.
But I love you. <+++++> You say that over and over but you don't even know me!
...I should? <+++++> YES!!! You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?"
He goes to a whorehouse every night? <+++++> Don't tell him I told you--he'd break my neck.
What about Ian? <+++++> Ray's a disaster.
What do you want to drink? <+++++> A coke.
So what's up? What'd I miss? <+++++> She told us the story of Freddy. It's a town legend. He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
Where is she? <+++++> I don't know.
The poor thing. Six years? <+++++> ...And she's with someone else.
Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog? ! <+++++> Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us... <+++++> I can't do this. I can't leave you...
It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too! <+++++> What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people-
You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent -- <+++++> What're you gonna do with me gone? You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now.
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch. <+++++> The standard ten.
Are you all right? <+++++> ... right as rain.
W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get? <+++++> You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.
You see, we've got to light into this and get it going-- <+++++> Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready.
I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin. <+++++> Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
Hi. <+++++> Hi.
Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express. <+++++> Yeah.
Has it been fifteen minutes? <+++++> We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation? <+++++> But the situation is perfectly clear, If you will allow me --
The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief. <+++++> I think they were Catholics.
And if you did, it'd never get on the air. Time-Life buried the Zapruder film for 15 years. <+++++> What about newspapers and magazines?
Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics. <+++++> That's not the point.
Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me? <+++++> Shhhh!
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27-- <+++++> The year 2027?
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee. <+++++> That's very nice of you. Thank you.
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do. <+++++> Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context. <+++++> I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
No. <+++++> He would have. You were his best friend. A better friend than me.
Shermin... <+++++> What's all this for?
What is her name? <+++++> Valdes. Miss Valdes. It's Spanish, you know.
Fuck you. <+++++> Fuck me? Fuck YOU! !
...you got to get me that street for nothing... <+++++> I will.
My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable. <+++++> I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
Darling, Peter says I could stay <+++++> Why not?
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ? <+++++> Yeah.
You can't leave. She won't let you. <+++++> Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home.
Good. What do you want? <+++++> Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs.
I think we may as well sit down. <+++++> I guess all the suspects are here.
I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean? <+++++> Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
Oh... Yeah. <+++++> Mind if I sit down?
Mr. Caiman... <+++++> Call me Charlie.
It was alive wasn't it? <+++++> I don't remember.
The important thing is, the police won't believe you. <+++++> I saw him on the floor. He was cut -Â  --here. The blood was running out. He was dead. I'm sure of it.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink. <+++++> Who did?
If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize. <+++++> If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
Social issues. Crime prevention. <+++++> Hand to hand combat?
That's good, Eddie. For how much? <+++++> You name it.
What did you get? <+++++> What do you mean?
I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside. I got something to show you. <+++++> Thanks, Unc.
That's right. <+++++> San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction. <+++++> Eventually you'll let go.
That's a fact. <+++++> Wynant's body?
Well, somet... <+++++> I mean she's a junior at Chicago University, she's twenty years old! Like when I first met you.
Uh-huh! <+++++> Run into Josh?
The cemetery... <+++++> Yeah, alright... I'll be there in ten.
You two need a time-out. <+++++> Blockhead started it!
-- White ladies? <+++++> -- Oh my yes.
Is it finished? <+++++> I think so.
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant. <+++++> You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
Laser-envy. <+++++> All right, that's enough. Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --
Got it. <+++++> Okay, here it is. Eldon Tyrell, his family and half his staff were just massacred. The cat is about to get out of the bag.
Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone. <+++++> So... they didn't...
Where you been? <+++++> I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going.
What changed? <+++++> Should probably ask him that.
They killed him. They threw him out that window. <+++++> Oh no...
Is he coming over now? Right away? <+++++> That's what he said.
You can survive anything but steel against your threat. Then it is over. The end. <+++++> How can I stop such a man?
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys? <+++++> Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
Hello? <+++++> S'up Trent?
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it. <+++++> If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.
This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place. <+++++> It has its moments of uncertainty.
Sounds boring. Are there any songs? <+++++> Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
You like Chicanos? <+++++> Sure.
Naw, I already ate. <+++++> Come on, Day, try it. For moms.
Yeah, but my- <+++++> I'm getting to your rug.
Yeah. <+++++> Where was that?
What if it is? <+++++> Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz.
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles. What? ! <+++++> You gave us <u>names</u>? What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
What are you talking about? <+++++> Nothing.
I followed them. An hour from the train station. <+++++> How many men?
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way. <+++++> You refused to comply with a direct order.
Nobody saw you bring her in? <+++++> There wasn't nobody around. This place was a shit-hole. I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.
Crabapple Cove. Maine. <+++++> Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
Well...I'm -- uh, Joe. And you're Susan. And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees -- <+++++> And is your heart beating strangely?
Lillian! <+++++> Where's Jill?
Fuck... <+++++> Three...
Why not? <+++++> Haven't called her.
There's no way of knowing. <+++++> Perfect...
-- forget it -- <+++++> -- we'll tell them what happened --
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that. <+++++> I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
 <+++++> As you know ratings have never been our primary goal. I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.
You donÂt know why heÂs come to Los Angeles? The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his? <+++++> No. A poor little rich boy who thought heÂd save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition.
You're kidding! <+++++> No, I'm not. Why do you think she does all this? It's one of the many ways she can put herself on display.
I don't think so. <+++++> We have to go home, Jason.
 <+++++> Huh?
Reasonably so. Yes. <+++++> And you'd hate to think you were common. My, wouldn't that sting! Well you're far from common, Officer Starling.
What did you want for Christmas that year? <+++++> Hungry Hungry Hippos.
When? <+++++> This afternoon. It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
There was a bang. <+++++> It was the window.
Time for a change. Keep your margins straight. <+++++> Yes.
All right, do me a favor. Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there. <+++++> What the hell for?
We've got a power leak. And it's unsafe. We're moving residences to the... Marriott Long Beach ... Just for the night ... <+++++> Oh, for God's sake
Don't you like Bodega Bay? <+++++> I don't know yet.
A hammock? <+++++> Have you ever made love in a hammock?
But she told him, Frances. She told him about us. <+++++> I know this is difficult for you. I know that you love her.
What's going on? <+++++> They're here.
A Butterfinger wrapper. <+++++> A rich, possibly fat, slob.
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you? <+++++> It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health. <+++++> So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
It doesn't hurt. <+++++> No?
For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it. You don't want her, you want me. <+++++> I need her; she's a cop. I have to kill a cop, and then...
It takes all types. <+++++> So who's he?
There's nothing around. Nobody's holding. <+++++> I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle? <+++++> Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine. <+++++> Good to meet you.
Are you a dream too? <+++++> Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
Is there another way? <+++++> We go down to the torpedo bay.
Yeah. Somebody won. <+++++> Check out the tent.
Can I lend you a hand? <+++++> As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
I didn't do anything...God saved her... <+++++> What's going to happen?
Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT? ? <+++++> Well - yeah - but that doesn't...<u>apply</u>. It was different then.
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask? <+++++> I'm looking for a missing person. My name's Arbogast, private investigator... Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week.
That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now. <+++++> It is for me.
It's on. <+++++> ...it's definitely on.
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy. <+++++> Have more coffee. It'll wake you up.
What about it? <+++++> The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
You're very macabre. <+++++> It's my birthday.
You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do? <+++++> I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.
I will not allow it. I will not! <+++++> Protest to my superiors if you like.
I said, what have we done? <+++++> Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher.
Helen. <+++++> You can call me Simon. You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
What? <+++++> You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
Wait. <+++++> You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me? <+++++> Nothin'. I told ya everything there is.
Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners! <+++++> Oh -- Jabez.
No. <+++++> Do you take cocaine, Irene?
What? <+++++> Pointing There's a beehive right there!
If you go, I go. <+++++> She meant nothing to you!
Can you help me? <+++++> Of course. Of course! Where? Can't I bring it to you?
What about the other kids? You get anything on them? <+++++> 
And certainly pretty. <+++++> Yes.
Why? <+++++> We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.
Where's Laurie? <+++++> I don't think she's coming with us.
What about her? <+++++> Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
I don't hate you, Jimmy. But I have a couple questions that I wanna ask.... <+++++> I'll answer anything.
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future? <+++++> No.
You knew about us? <+++++> Sorry. Thought you knew I knew.
So I... well, well, you know the rest. <+++++> Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
Do you want to do something tonight? <+++++> I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it? I have to go to the store!
You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks? <+++++> No. I'm going home.
Unfeasible. <+++++> Is that all?
Okay. <+++++> I'll catch up with you.
But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station-- <+++++> Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy. <+++++> Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
I kind of half expected you to thank me. <+++++> Your ego is colossal.
I don't know. Some disease. <+++++> What disease?
No. I'm doing it behind her back. <+++++> In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
Was there never ambition? <+++++> Maybe, once.
Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it? <+++++> Why?
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago. <+++++> Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things.
That's it then. Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry. Jesus. <+++++> Do we just leave him there?
Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see. <+++++> Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.
I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye. <+++++> Kay, I told you...
 <+++++> Immigration Officer?
Hello, little orphan boy. What happened to you? <+++++> Skateboard.
Which way? <+++++> Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
She took a flight to San Francisco. We figure she's going to connect to New Hampshire; her parents' place. <+++++> I can't let him down.
That's all I get? <+++++> We'll make you better. We can put the pieces back. We can do that.
Did you ever see a lion that size? <+++++> Not even close. What happened?
But, Bishop... <+++++> St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality. To all in need.
I'm a phony -- just like you, man. <+++++> What do you mean?
Thanks. <+++++> We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this. <+++++> Do I?
How are they going to do it? <+++++> McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
Men? <+++++> Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
Oh? You've tried? <+++++> Well, I do a little drawing --
What's the matter? What are you saying? <+++++> 
I know how Chase really died. <+++++> What are you talking about?
Just like that? <+++++> Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
That is repugnant. You have the habits of a goat. <+++++> <<belch>>
Bruce, you can't. <+++++> Chase is coming for dinner. Why don't you join us.
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do? <+++++> You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
Move with the music. <+++++> Um...okay...
There's nothing for me to do here anymore... I don't belong here I want to be with Him now... <+++++> Do you think you are ready?
Jesus, Lindsey-- <+++++> Bud, something really important is happening here.
Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology. <+++++> Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
Don't... don't say that to me... <+++++> Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk.
What is that <i>thing</i>? <+++++> I think that thing is Ben.
Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it? <+++++> Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision. <+++++> And how would I know that?
Right. Sit up so I can see you. <+++++> Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl! <+++++> What do you mean we?
Where do you get this shit? <+++++> Ricki Lake.
Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you. You're not going to find what you're looking for. <+++++> What do you mean?
I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier. <+++++> Bring me the bay scallops with mercury poisoning.
Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise. <+++++> ... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. <+++++> Or the one.
Daughter -- my daughter -- <+++++> She was born before your wife returned here to die. You never knew.
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one. <+++++> It's all my fault. I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling? <+++++> I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved.
...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it. <+++++> It's not strictly legal.
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all. <+++++> Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
I want to know you. <+++++> I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
Idle hands, the devil's workshop. <+++++> There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
You alright? Y'okay? <+++++> Yeah. No, not really.
You called the police? <+++++> They're going to send detectives.
FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT! <+++++> I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep.
I gotta, I gotta go...! <+++++> Alonzo...
How'd you get this? <+++++> Boxin'.
Yes. <+++++> Let me have them, and I might consider it.
It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid -- <+++++> I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try. <+++++> [Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]
Where? <+++++> California.
Oh, so loosely. <+++++> No, not "Oh, so loosely"! Real specifically! Is that how you see us?
"It's why the witch kills children." <+++++> I thought all witches were benign and good.
Huh huh huh huh huh huh. <+++++> Uh... Uh...
...above Murmansk, and Finland. <+++++> Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place. <+++++> We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig. Guy had it under a wig. <+++++> Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
I never bought that. <+++++> Oh?
Hold it. Whoa... What's your name, son? <+++++> Tommy Jarvis. We gotta do something. He's even more powerful now that...
I want you to try something with me, okay? <+++++> I've taken a lot of morphine. Oral morphine...for my back. Can I wait till I can say no and sound convincing?
He's right on the heading. <+++++> All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.
 <+++++> All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --
Tell me all the details. <+++++> It was... Fantastic.
What on? <+++++> On your piano, that is the swap.
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect. <+++++> Really! Is it serious?
Long live Theramini. Take a left here? <+++++> But what if Sarris survives?
You're better when you take them. <+++++> I know, I know. But still, somehow I don't feel better.
What? <+++++> Nothing. So good luck.
To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge. <+++++> We have to cover both possibilities. We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering.
The children! May I see? <+++++> Of course.
The sunrise? What for? <+++++> Jeez, what do you think? To see it!
What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor? <+++++> Mine? Why--naturally--whatever benefits the state is mighty important to me--owning a lot of its industry-- newspapers and other odds and ends.
I haven't broken any laws. <+++++> Then you won't mind if I look around.
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin? <+++++> Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms. <+++++> Get yourself something to eat.
You got to be kidding me. <+++++> I'm not kidding.
You're the only woman he ever took out. <+++++> Not true.
Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to-- <+++++> Don't bother. I'm coming home.
This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall -- <+++++> Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.
However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain. <+++++> You're mad at me, aren't you?
Why are you telling him that. Are you crazy? <+++++> The rest of the money is here in the car. Why don't you come and get it?
They all know you? <+++++> 'Course they all know me. And I know all them. Town's got my name, don't it?
Oh, I can't stand it. <+++++> What is it?
I don't know. <+++++> Where did he keep his money?
Yes. <+++++> I'm Carrie Frazier from Toys 'R Us. Judy Hinton from May Company told me I could ask you something.
You know where they are? <+++++> Sure.
You're here early today. <+++++> We're getting out of the ground today.
Do it. <+++++> Yeah, but where's the third guy?
Will I get to work for Outpost? <+++++> No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it. <+++++> We don't know that's true, he never said that.
You were going to be married. <+++++> How did you know that?
What it is? <+++++> Not what...who. Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
Where's where I asked him about being scared? You should work on your speech. <+++++> No. It makes me nervous to think about it. Let's do this.
Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here. <+++++> Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me.
Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything. <+++++> I don't have what they want, Harry. Harry, will you tell me something?
Mr. Jameson-- <+++++> I got a question, college boy. What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?
This is great. And it's yours? You like own it? <+++++> The bank owns it. But I'm working on it.
No Lisa Anderson, detective. <+++++> Can there be some mistake?
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight. <+++++> Great. See ya then.
That's what I thought! <+++++> Could you concentrate for five seconds?
Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe. <+++++> I'd love to go there one time...
But Frank Ligourin had another girl you said, besides McKenna and you. <+++++> Arlyn Page.
Jesus, don't quibble with me. I want to know if a Great White Shark did this. <+++++> Probably.
Who's voice was it, Dottie? <+++++> It was her! Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there! I'm lucky I'm not DEAD! !
How fast? <+++++> Twenty-four-five.
Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends? <+++++> No reason at all, darlin'.
You hear that? Anything we want. Anything...Well?? ? <+++++> Well what?
I'm thinking about producing. <+++++> How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
And they can't fly around out there forever. <+++++> So we wait.
That the word on our boy? <+++++> Yeah, this is Skinny.
Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby. <+++++> The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
How much for your company at chow? <+++++> Company, shit. I watch the man's back.
Ok. <+++++> Ok, bye, bye.
I'm sorry, sir. General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty. <+++++> What is your name, young lady?
They seemed, closing by much <+++++> Tony and China?
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai? <+++++> Brian told you that?
Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol. <+++++> Let's load 'em.
Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men. <+++++> Yes, I know.
Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series... <+++++> I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
I never had that. Ever. Don't ask me to give it up. I need it. <+++++> More than you need me.
I thought you wanted... <+++++> A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
You quitting? <+++++> IÂm desperate to start but I donÂt have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I canÂt get enough of.
Told you, I did. Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse. <+++++> The boy is our last hope.
Look, what do you expect? Considering how we met you. <+++++> What do you mean?
Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock. <+++++> Where does her get the power to summon all his old raffish friends? They all smell of moth balls.
Who's the girl? <+++++> Jewish...
Hello...? Sully...? Sully, that you? <+++++> Who the fuck is it to you?
I think we're lost. <+++++> You have a map.
With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes. Maybe he's just unlucky. <+++++> I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky. Widen the sweep. The West side. Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.
Then why send me back to them? ! <+++++> Because I have to!
...that...he <u>sees</u> that... <+++++> As the Old Mill goes around...
I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection. <+++++> I know what you mean.
Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I'm going to talk to someone. <+++++> Wait?
Let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son. <+++++> No. Before anyone moves, you two shake hands and don't carry it any further.
Well, here are fifty francs. <+++++> Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
What do you mean? I remember everything! Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper. <+++++> You have no pants, sir.
George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again. <+++++> I must trust you, Matthew. I cannot stop this without you.
--which Young? <+++++> Larry Young, a California lawyer--
Really? Care to make a wager on that? <+++++> Good luck, Sebastian.
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife. <+++++> Holy shit!
Why don't we talk inside? <+++++> Well...  ... perhaps for a few minutes.
Here's the plan. You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr. William Jones. <+++++> What urgent message?
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl? <+++++> Down that way.
How much we got left, honey? <+++++> Under a hundred.
No. <+++++> So what are we gonna do, Jack?
Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch. <+++++> We're not gonna have pie and punch!
Zackly. <+++++> Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
What do I get? <+++++> The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
Please! <+++++> Bet you'll never look at birds the same way again!
Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason. <+++++> There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
Of course he is. <+++++> Are you?
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it? <+++++> Well, I don't have no trousers on...
I can see her, the phone in her hand. Became a sort of joke between us. Only it wasn't a joke. <+++++> She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
You already made the delivery? <+++++> No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing. We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.
Well? <+++++> They're coming.
I can see that, what're they for? <+++++> In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship.
Do you have your papers, sir? <+++++> What?
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on. <+++++> Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Okey-doke. <+++++> We have to own this guy, Marion. We don't want him dead; we need to use him.
You're a pal, Rock -- How 'bout yo' talk to her? Y'know, it's Thanksgivin' tomorrow. <+++++> ...Sure.
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive. <+++++> Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun. <+++++> You don't?
I can't promise you anything. <+++++> You think I'm crazy.
What the fuck... ! <+++++> I promised him to Machine.
Well, thanks for coming. <+++++> You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba. What can I do for you?
I just hope this is still good up there. <+++++> Mom?
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket. <+++++> Oh man, you're way out of our league.
 <+++++> I know all that, chief, and I don't like it any better than you do, but there's something else --
And the church. <+++++> And the wedding date. There's the two of us.
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick... <+++++> Oswald:  We need one more thing.
It's gotta be the next one. I mean it's gotta be! Right, Albert? <+++++> Fuckin' A. It's gotta!
It's not what you think. <+++++> What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
Tell him I'm not here. <+++++> I did.
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me. <+++++> Who?
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence. That was... <+++++> That was good. You were holding the evidence.
And you're sure about that? <+++++> Yeah, I'm sure.
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ... <+++++> You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
That would be no. <+++++> I've had it. No more wirehead shit in my car. You understand? You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
How many'd you do? <+++++> Five.
Yes. <+++++> I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.
They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in. <+++++> No, I can't. I'm sorry and all, but...
This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest. <+++++> Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here. <+++++> I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.
And I congratulate you. <+++++> What for?
Startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh. <+++++> Inventin' jokes ain't easy.
Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch. <+++++> I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard. <+++++> That sounds good.
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before. <+++++> You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
John: gimme a cuesta-ray. <+++++> Oh shit, what's today?
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday -- <+++++> -- just --
Nay. Tempting as your invitation be. Tell me one thing more. <+++++> Ask away, sweet man.
I don't know. I think she's breathing. <+++++> Okay. Okay, look my wife called the police. They're coming. It's not too late.
Having fun yet? No? I'll give you a hint. Remember whatshername? <+++++> Shelly?
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't. <+++++> What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -
Hey, Ray, what's the name of that nightclub of yours? <+++++> You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
All it is is onions and gravy. <+++++> I'm allergic to onions.
Well, teacher's away and actors will be actors... <+++++> During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night...
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone. <+++++> <u>What</u>?
How do we know what room she's in? <+++++> Wait here.
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves. <+++++> I'll go up and take a look at the General Â- perhaps sit with him.
And, writing on the walls happens all the time. It's like the fashionable thing to do. <+++++> One is gluttony.
She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is. <+++++> Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel. <+++++> The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...
Without the glasses you're not even ugly. I don't need them because I never read. How do I look. <+++++> Like Clark Kent. Now Superman.
Oh, yeah? <+++++> Yes. He never forgave him for it.
Yeah. <+++++> Were you drinking?
And I said so what. You think she's any happier? <+++++> What d'you mean, any happier?
Why me? <+++++> We like you. At least the computer at Langley likes you. Pulled your file because of various factors. Service record. Area familiarity.
 <+++++> Front page. Washington Post. Tomorrow.
Yeah. but. <+++++> Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
What's wrong with you? <+++++> I just had a mental picture of...
I'm okay, you go. <+++++> Why the hell should you believe him? He had us beat up. Naked. That's nasty shit.
Just a little bit too much, I think. <+++++> How do you mean?
Are you okay? <+++++> There's that question...
We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece. I'm waiting for the girl. Her mother wants to talk to her. <+++++> Hand me the phone.
It's really cold. <+++++> Yeah. It smells like snow.
The most respected... <+++++> Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something.
Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight. <+++++> Why not?
Micheal? Do you have something to tell me? <+++++> Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
Sure I do. <+++++> You mean that?
Not really to live, just to play. <+++++> That building?
I'll be gone again tomorrow. <+++++> ...Guess it was her time to go. You can't argue... when the good Lord calls you home.
I can't handle that thing. <+++++> Don't worry, I can.
See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel. <+++++> If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing. <+++++> But you must! I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father. I'd never make it.
Dr. Lunacharsky...? <+++++> Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
Do you even know these kids? <+++++> They hid my car--
Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke? <+++++> No.
Tyrone... <+++++> Oh shit Alma... you're...
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything. <+++++> Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
No, it's not what you think, I swear! <+++++> Save it for the jury. I hope Sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma. <+++++> I'm on my way.
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home. <+++++> I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else -- <+++++> I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
When did you begin to question Lastday? <+++++> I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green. What would you like to relive, Logan?
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence? <+++++> Yes. Come in.
California... <+++++> Live there?
No. <+++++> What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
Like what? <+++++> Action! Interaction! Give and take! Challenge and response!
No, everything's fine. Honestly. Thanks anyway. <+++++> Okay, just thought I'd check. Good night, Dana. Sleep well. Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
What's happening to you, Frank? You're acting like you're on trial here. This has become personal to you. <+++++> Back off, John.
That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore. <+++++> Watch out for them air pockets!
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril. <+++++> Okay...
As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her. <+++++> No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you. <+++++> 
But what's it look like? <+++++> What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
What kind of information? <+++++> She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.
I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl... <+++++> She's all right, Andy.
You really are one dumb asshole. <+++++> Life is unpredictable.
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot? <+++++> Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . .
Gorkon's own man? ? <+++++> Who else?
Or a vegetarian? <+++++> Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap.
For what? <+++++> I think... for the pleasure of the kill.
Cute puppy. <+++++> He must be on his way to pee out a fire.
People have made mistakes in these situations before. <+++++> I've been investigating sightings for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin. This one's real.
Outside? <+++++> Yeah --
Could <u>she</u> stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse. <+++++> No!! Out!
...Stanley Moss... <+++++> 8 days and we bring it back home....
You didn't walk out here. <+++++> It's mine all right.
Helena, please. This is out of your hands. <+++++> I know I made things worse. I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you.
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard. This guy's an eccentric genius. <+++++> Hey, so was Mr. Wizard.
Unbearable, I'd imagine. <+++++> I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
Do you know where fuse box is? <+++++> In the cellar, I think. Wait, I'll take care of it.
That's not even -- <+++++> Yeah yeah yeah. Do you have my money?
She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you. <+++++> Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
Gotta go. <+++++> Where?
To get on the... <+++++> To get on the board. Yeah. How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack?
Safety on? <+++++> Yeah.
I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing. <+++++> My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
<u>What</u>? ! <+++++> Sshhhh!
Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would? <+++++> The Ba'ku.
We had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang...  ... but Shelly made them see the error of their ways. <+++++> It was nothing.
But, but -- what would I do? <+++++> Anything! Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn. I can't be sure, Peter. <+++++> No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them.
I was only talkin' to her. <+++++> She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives. <+++++> I'm going to count to three...
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice. <+++++> That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
You being cute? <+++++> I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
It's the biggest secret I've got. <+++++> Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me. <+++++> I have lived in this place, like my fathers before me, guarding the old knowledge.
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that. <+++++> You're taking "no" for an answer?
Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack? <+++++> Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac.
Oh yeah! <+++++> I didn't think anyone would get it.
Dad, you seen the drill? <+++++> What drill?
This week. <+++++> Ever again.
You're surrendering. <+++++> Yes, sir.
She says she's gonna write fiction. <+++++> Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
Do you know me? <+++++> Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
Men he knew he could march into certain death. <+++++> But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent                  t us to kill someone?
Bullshit. They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him... <+++++> No, now wait... think about it. What did you see... ?
Let's go, Chucky. A police escort is gonna pick us up en route. You too, LaPlante. <+++++> Me!
Yes. <+++++> I was quite enjoying that.
No. <+++++> Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?
That'll work out just fine. When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina. How does that sound? <+++++> Familiar. Be careful, Eddie.
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said. <+++++> I'm sorry.
Wait -- down where? <+++++> To the spacecraft. To investigate.
Have you got a minute? <+++++> Not much more. Big day in the big city. What's on your mind?
Do you ever do any writing? <+++++> No, I don't.
Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall. <+++++> Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
Nine. <+++++> Any of us?
Excuse me. What part of NO don't you understand? <+++++> Mace, you're my friend. I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it. <+++++> Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore. <+++++> What's wrong?
Hold on Â <+++++> I didn't do this, I did NOT do thisÂ
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield. <+++++> Nice.
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do? <+++++> No.
I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you? Not while I'm holding this. <+++++> Krieger.
Let's roll. We got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to Doucet. 0800 this morning. <+++++> What else did he get?
 <+++++> ...Work okay?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout... <+++++> Don't worry about it -
I don't know. Why don't you ask him? <+++++> C'mon, Jackie, I'm only trying -- George --
Joseph Macdonald... Your son. <+++++> Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
Adolph J. Giron. <+++++> And you expect me to believe that?
Do you want a coffee? <+++++> No. No, no. Thank you.
Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions. <+++++> That's correct -- but Andrew never told me he had a heart condition. He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious.
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him. <+++++> What? !
Of you? <+++++> Yes.
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police. <+++++> But Sacha always puts out that light --
...No. Why was it. <+++++> I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
I'm Joe Buck from Texas and I'm gonna buy you a drink, what do you say to that? <+++++> Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't mind if I do.
Hey. Fuck you. <+++++> Where's Jack? Anybody seen Jack?
Wouldn't know anything about it. <+++++> That's too bad. I was hoping you were there. Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.
MAVERICK. <+++++> YEAH, COUGAR?
Yeah. Maybe. <+++++> Wait here for me, Gummy.
He was... taken. <+++++> He was killed.
That's very thoughtful. <+++++> Never a break. Never.
Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him? <+++++> Whatever.
That's just a dream, William! <+++++> We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over. <+++++> I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit. <+++++> The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.
Are you sure this is a real dance? <+++++> Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now. <+++++> Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
So did I. <+++++> But then I had a brother and a sister left.
 <+++++> Everything O.K. ?
 <+++++> For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
No - the ukulele. And I sing. <+++++> For your own amusement?
We gotta talk. <+++++> What's up?
One word. You won't find it in the phone book. <+++++> Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
I've missed a step. <+++++> He has you on a pedestal. And me in his arms.
Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains. I guess it gets cold at night. I'm just gonna bring everything. <+++++> Okay. I will, too.
<u>You</u>? <+++++> It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
I'm sorry, I don't understand. <+++++> It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
Why are you working today? <+++++> Holidays are our busiest days. No one likes to be alone on holidays. I know I don't.
All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister? <+++++> I'm not sure.
What are you getting at, Moran? <+++++> You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill. Your notes are very complete.
Your extensive law enforcement contacts should be of some use. <+++++> I was never politically correct enough for Comrade Dowd.
No, I'd better not. <+++++> Sure, sure, give go.
Mom...what are you doing here? <+++++> Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.
Why do you look at me like that? <+++++> I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
Okay, I get the point. <+++++> So, whatever happened to her?
Who are you again? <+++++> Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
This. I can't tell you how sorry I am! <+++++> Don't give it another thought, one of destiny's many pranks. After all, you didn't personally drain the gasoline out of the tank...
No. <+++++> Why not?
Why were you yelling like that? ! <+++++> What are you doing here? Please... leave... you can't stay here...
What do you think you're doing? <+++++> You tell me... I want to know who's behind this. Who did this to me... how, why... ?
You, me and Harry. He's asleep. <+++++> Wake him, then. Let's go. Get outta --
Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people. <+++++> I ain't neither.
Will somebody please tell me what this is all about! ? <+++++> It's you I was after all along, Lucy. To be our day time guardian.
Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you? <+++++> I think so.
My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor? <+++++> I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change. <+++++> Will it?
And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats? <+++++> Yes, I understand. Thank you.
The _Rolls_? <+++++> _No_, sir. _The_ _other_ _car_!
Thanks. For everything. <+++++> No sweat.
I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray. All tricked out and cherry. I'm going to be so sweet. <+++++> A car? You're going to buy a car?
You're crazy! You're really out of your mind! <+++++> I might be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough to marry you twice. There's a lot of things I can't change.
No? Why not? <+++++> You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.
You live like a pig. <+++++> Can't you say something nice once?
Okay, let's do it. <+++++> Awright! I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
Oh, my. <+++++> Don't go to pieces. I haven't got time tonight.
Did you have an accident in the lake? <+++++> No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
I want... to marry you! <+++++> I... accept your proposal!
Marry me instead. <+++++> Thank you, Herb. You're a wonderful man. You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
You should be at the game. <+++++> No, no--I'm fine. Millie, how much time did you and Jimmy spend together before he proposed?
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot; <+++++> Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way... <+++++> Mother, where did you go to law school?
ÂDo you? <+++++> Well, no, Johnny, I just thought I should've been told ifÂ
No, not at all! <+++++> Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions.
After all, you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds. <+++++> I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...
Hold you tight... Feel everythin' in you now... Stay quiet... Say "fuck me" and then I'll leave. <+++++> No way... GET OUT!! !
I guess I should go. <+++++> I want you to stay with me.
Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination. <+++++> I am not with the Inquisition.
Why? <+++++> IÂm compulsive and weird?
Hello. <+++++> Sammy.
Nah. You're driving it too carefully. <+++++> Maybe I just bought it.
Mama?? ? <+++++> You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
He's in Florida. Palm Beach. <+++++> When's he due back?
That's true. What are you? <+++++> I don't enjoy watching things suffer.
I'd say logic more than faith. The odds were on my side. <+++++> And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
Now don't fuss, Paul. <+++++> Why would I run away?
How? <+++++> Well, when you get up on the radio, all you have to do is say the whole thing's a frame-up.
You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>. <+++++> I failed to resolve the situation.
. . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based. <+++++> Is that a fact! You'd better put me name down for an advance copy!
Would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while? <+++++> Finn -
Scully? <+++++> Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
No! Don't go back into the house... It's too nice outside. <+++++> My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here. Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side. <+++++> Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
Men? They look more like weasles to me. <+++++> Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work. The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
You hear that? <+++++> Hear what?
You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies. <+++++> Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
That's jolly. <+++++> Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him. <+++++> I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things... <+++++> Incredible.
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker? <+++++> I don't think so.
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying? <+++++> Yes.
It's walkin' pretty slow at this point. <+++++> You guys are fuckin' sick.
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you? <+++++> I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
Naw, you go first. <+++++> You go first.
That was good. You were holding the evidence. <+++++> You were merciless. You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course. <+++++> You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not.
Those mountains? are they? <+++++> Very bad now. Maybe war. Those Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus again ) How'd you lose your friends?
Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him! <+++++> It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
How about the pig-lizard? <+++++> Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard.
Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting like this. They may be on to us. <+++++> Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
What are you going to do? <+++++> Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.
No -- I will. <+++++> I stood up first.
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil. <+++++> Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it.
In fact, when the state boys called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I think I said, "So what?" <+++++> Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for? <+++++> I came for love...
I have to shoot. <+++++> Do it, quickly. Please. Aim for the eye.
I don't know why I've told you all this. I hardly know you. <+++++> Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down. Somebody's worried about my health. <+++++> Ah-hah.
You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires. Think you can handle it? <+++++> Depends. You got a memo?
I don't understand. Track 2's Chile? <+++++> Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability, there's a Track 2.
Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love. <+++++> Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her.
I know you're not. <+++++> You treat me like I was.
Yes! <+++++> No!... ... You kids better leave. This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
What do you want, Paula? What do you really want? <+++++> To have a good time with you until you have to go.
Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al. <+++++> No. Only celebrities now.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him. <+++++> I'll take him with me downtown. And you, too, Rose, if you want a ride.
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays? <+++++> Well, for the baby, really.
Once a week you like a gentleman? <+++++> Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not. Why all the bloody needle?
Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you -- <+++++> I don't wanna talk to you.
That's so good to hear, sweetheart. It really is. You know, I .. are you alone? <+++++> Yes. 53
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost. <+++++> Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
He's sick. <+++++> For a change.
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have. <+++++> My name is Klaatu. I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309.
Then make sure he gets put away for longer. <+++++> How?
Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison. He was looking into getting him out. He didn't believe the official story. <+++++> Why not?
You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous. <+++++> Why the hell we drivin' here?
You would do this? You would actually -- <+++++> In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
Couldn't you just do a phone interview? <+++++> Not for the kind of place I want to do. I won't be in Chicago that long.
Nobody leaves. <+++++> Observe.
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money. <+++++> Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him... <+++++> And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
...so rich? <+++++> ...so accomplished.
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here! <+++++> I said I'll think about it.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared. <+++++> I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
No. <+++++> No?
Did anyone else know about the baby? <+++++> I can't tell you that.
Because what I am interested in is right here... <+++++> What would you have me do?
He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn." <+++++> Pup corn?
How was your flight? <+++++> Fine.
Who said they left then? <+++++> Who left -- where?
You got me. <+++++> I love you, Grady.
Yeah. <+++++> So do I.  I want to be ready... You have to be ready... It has to be there, in your mind.
Put some together, now, and tell us that you're not responsible -- that every damnable bit of it doesn't rest squarely on your shoulders! <+++++> You're wrong, Wesley. The guilt is mine -- all of it.
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche. <+++++> You are direct, aren't you?
Many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body. Where has it been laid out? <+++++> It hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you're looking at it.
In the microwave. <+++++> Make anyone cry today?
What time does the plane leave? <+++++> Eight thirty.
Where'd they go? <+++++> I don't know.
Raoul is everything to me. <+++++> I know.
Yes, I do. <+++++> What do you do?
I see you're playing your radio, Major. Isn't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base? <+++++> Oh, it's not my radio, sir. I picked it up in the communications center.
What are you going to do? <+++++> I'm going to get it for him. Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time.
Absolutely not. <+++++> Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that?
Creepy guy. <+++++> The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable.
That is correct. <+++++> Do you think Alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator?
... armed robbery ... <+++++> Well, armed, then. Nobody's been hurt.
You make everything a fucking travesty! <+++++> Dude, I'm--it was an accident!
Hello Marylin. <+++++> Hello Miles.
As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him. <+++++> ...LeonÂs not here. How did you get here? Phil doesnÂt know where I live.
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk! <+++++> I thought it was great. You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
Look, this is my house. I'd like toÂ <+++++> Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember. <+++++> Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
Don't be fooled by appearances. <+++++> It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?
Father! <+++++> These are priceless artifacts! They're ruining the site!
You see? Life can be so simple. <+++++> For twelve francs, seventy-five.
Did you ever think life would turn out like this? <+++++> No.
Oh, I was just going to... <+++++> A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
Take this off. <+++++> He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
You know he's not...and he's coming for you. <+++++> You food'll be right out.
She told me what you said, Norman. <+++++> What is it, Harry?
I don't know her.. or particularly want to. <+++++> You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world.
No, don't Jack, don't. <+++++> Who sent you, Thorpey?
Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally? <+++++> So we should "wait and see." For how long?
Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad? <+++++> You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you.
Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio. <+++++> Greer?
You always said you wanted to live in a palace. <+++++> Can't we go back, Charlie?
It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it? <+++++> Yes, darling,
I thought you were tired of your business? <+++++> I'm just tired in general.
 <+++++> What do you think?
I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it. <+++++> Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope. <+++++> No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
I missed all of you. We're okay, aren't we? <+++++> We're great.
Is it...? <+++++> Trouble at work?
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today. <+++++> Oh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always do.
You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove? <+++++> I'm not trying to prove anything. I was burying my dog.
Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort. <+++++> Yes. You may. You there. What does Munro call you? The "Scotsman" has sent one of his Indian allies to guide you.
No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks. <+++++> The socks? It's cold in here.
You'll probably be bigger than your brothers. <+++++> Yeah!
How lucky we are. <+++++> Aren't we full of ourselves today? I think it's because of the lion.
The Great War? <+++++> By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over. He missed out.
Oh, okay. Here it comes. <+++++> Here what comes?
He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly. <+++++> Why doesn't it scare you?
Me? ! <+++++> Naturally.
Back up. How do you know he's gay? <+++++> Gay men know designers. Straight men don't.
If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong. <+++++> I never said I wasn't upset. Of course I'm upset. I miss her terribly.
All his life. He's tried everything. <+++++> Still clear?
He's sick? <+++++> Yeah, he needs souls to live. When you guys left, you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies.
Are you all right? <+++++> I'm ok.
This is... <+++++> We know each other.
Are you a regular there? <+++++> Are you serious? My boyfriend ditched me...
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very... <+++++> When did he go off chemo?
Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her. <+++++> What'll it be Fletch?
You aren't? <+++++> No. I mean yes, I'm not. I decided to call it off. Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
Two lumps, madame? <+++++> Please! Thank you.
His name? <+++++> Does it matter? Another technician. But an interesting thing - he was there that day in Dealey Plaza. You know how I know?
What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day? <+++++> No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
Where ya goin? <+++++> Away.
Coming dad. I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye. <+++++> Bye.
 <+++++> What the hell is this? Who are you?
You're taking advantage of a minor. <+++++> When do we start?
I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue. <+++++> You don't call that music, though.
In New York? <+++++> What?
Tractor beam, aye! <+++++> If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock...
That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks? <+++++> Nearly four.
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident. <+++++> SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
You know somebody? <+++++> Of course not. That's not the point. Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
I'm listening. <+++++> Good. I want you to listen.
What's that supposed to mean? <+++++> Think about it.
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice. <+++++> Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that.
Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex? <+++++> Huh?
What? <+++++> You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.
She hates dem. <+++++> Too bad. How 'bout a dress?
Excuse me, "sir". I thought we spoke as equals. <+++++> Equals?
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong? <+++++> I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.
Matthew, you don't have to-- . <+++++> Stay back! I'm okay.
They're out of town. <+++++> Then I'll make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights.
What? You gotta be joking. <+++++> We go back, seal it up again, and come in tomorrow night - every night 'till we get out of here.
Yeah, sure... very funny.... <+++++> Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us... Please?
I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things. <+++++> You're really good friends with the Chancellor, aren't you?
Madmartigan! What did you do this time? <+++++> Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire? <+++++> That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
Ohh! <+++++> You know.
They're driving me nuts! <+++++> They're singing.
It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation. <+++++> Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
You don't have a complete layout of the place. Even if you manage to avoid a fight you won't know where to go. <+++++> We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, Toby.
Mose...try to remember!...You were in Scar's camp... <+++++> Ay-eh...Made out I was crazy... Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away...
Got here as soon as I could. <+++++> Dance with me...
There is no letter. <+++++> We'll get a handwriting expert toÂ  What!
Reed said it'd be weeks till -- <+++++> He <u>also</u> said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay <+++++> No. Empress, you --
Guess "please" would be a stretch. <+++++> Please.
Now, Fran -- <+++++> And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
Excuse me ... Are you talking about recognizing China, Mr. President? That would cost us our strongest support. <+++++> No ... I can do this because I've spent my whole career building anti Communist credentials.
I stood up first. <+++++> That doesn't matter.
That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister. <+++++> Look, are we going to do it or not?
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt? <+++++> All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.
You want somethin'? <+++++> You Harlin?
But, finally, one factor tipped the scales. We received information from a very re- liable source that your country was going to build one. <+++++> That's preposterous! We have no such program!
Claire? <+++++> Huh? Absolutely. Take your time.
What? <+++++> Look!
I didn't see anything. <+++++> Well, don't stand there, you idiot. Go and look. Open the window. Oh, why did he have to pick on my building?
Whether she wants to or not...she's not going. <+++++> Let go of her.
You're going out, I swear to you, you're going... <+++++> Hey, fella, let's get this done...
No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you? <+++++> I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
It's a folk song. <+++++> Arabic?
Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness. How long till dawn? <+++++> Well... this rock rotates every two hours. The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.
 <+++++> He's in interrogation?
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident. <+++++> A hunting accident is perfect.
Where does he work? <+++++> Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
Dino droppings? <+++++> Yeah.
Go where? Where're you going? <+++++> Please, Penny. You just gotta trust me now. Okay? And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
Don't mind him, Chucky. You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline. <+++++> Screw you, Valentino. I haven't seen you swapping spit with anybody.
What're you talking about? <+++++> What kind of man are you? Are you a good man?
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school? <+++++> But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head. <+++++> I'm sorry. Really... I am.
Hello? <+++++> It's Charlotte.
So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day? <+++++> You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?
The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before... <+++++> But you don't?
Well then, I'll pray for rain. <+++++> See the condoms in the grass over there. We killed tonight, Veronica. We murdered our baby.
As a child, I never had no room all to myself, we were awful poor. Buddy... I have got a confession to make. <+++++> What is it, Rose?
Why, do you think we're going to? <+++++> I don't know -- how would I know?
I do. You never stood up for yourself. Ever. If I was ashamed, it was because of that. <+++++> That's ridiculous.
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days. ... Robert... Is there any improvement...? <+++++> No, Eve... I'm sorry.
You're a novelist - why didn't you tell me? <+++++> And not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work ELLEN...
What are you doing? <+++++> Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando. <+++++> That's not his apartment.
Thank you, Officer Ripley. That will be... <+++++> ...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching...
Bones, are you afraid of the future? <+++++> That was the general idea I intended to convey.
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too. <+++++> I just don't think you're being fair.
No. <+++++> A magician *makes* magic. Any fool can use it.
Wanted what? <+++++> De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you. None of us has had the heart.
What's your name! <+++++> Jim. What's yours?
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy! Sit down, sit down...  Did she come? <+++++> No, nobody came.
Are you going to strike me? You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes. <+++++> Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
I think I'm onto something, Joe. <+++++> Me too. I'm drunk.
If I'd made more money ...I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just ... <+++++> There will be generations because of what you did.
Not what? <+++++> He's not crazy.
You figger Scar means to kill us? <+++++> 
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it? <+++++> Yeah.
Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong. <+++++> Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
You know how old I am. <+++++> God help us all when you're forty.
And it's not right to the customers. <+++++> I know it's not. I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western?
They're bugs, Wyatt. You Know all your smart talk about Live and let live? Ain't no live And let live with bugs. <+++++> I know, I was wrong. But Morg, Look, we got to get out.
Hey, when you talk to him, see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent. <+++++> That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.
Good evening. You see, here we are again. <+++++> I take that as a great compliment to Sam. I suppose he means to you Paris of, well, happier days.
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things. <+++++> But I'm curious, Rose.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max. <+++++> Oh, I'll represent alright.
I wasn't with you. <+++++> I know.
You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink? <+++++> Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles?
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel? <+++++> I do not know what you are referring to.
Seems to like some of the same places you do. Funny you never met. <+++++> Yeah, real funny. You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
What? <+++++> That!
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute. <+++++> I would--but our rehearsal starts right away. Before I go I want to ask you a little favor.
It'll be tight, but we should make it. <+++++> What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
Think, John. Why would they set you up? <+++++> Because I found out about her...
This spells trouble. <+++++> I have a guest.
Why? <+++++> The TV didn't work.
Oooooo. <+++++> Right in there, pal.
What are you going to do with it? <+++++> I told them to run it through the cycles.
Do I have to? <+++++> You can call me Ostreicher.
Anthony, I -- <+++++> And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
Tell me... <+++++> I love you...
Come on Booth! Look at these scumbags around us. Who's going to know what happened! Let's take it and get out of here! <+++++> Well someone's gonna find them.
That's the boy. <+++++> You figure him for a dope runner?
Could you believe those girls! <+++++> 'Nellie's Nymphos!'
Hey! <+++++> ...from Mavis, also.
What? <+++++> It's just so strange...
Seven. <+++++> Nine?
Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike? <+++++> You first.
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification. <+++++> 
Here he comes. <+++++> What the fuck is going on?
Where's everybody? <+++++> I dunno -- I can't figure it out. I've invited them all. Why don't they come?
Then who was he? <+++++> Just some guy... they found.
Don't tune it too good. <+++++> Leave it flat, will you, Ben?
What? <+++++> When he finds out.
Don't tell me, let me guess. All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler? <+++++> We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid. <+++++> Shall we drink to that?
What about that camera? <+++++> What camera?
Hello, Niagara. <+++++> He notices.
We'll have the other papers crazy. Babe, I could kiss you! <+++++> Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
Be careful. <+++++> Thank you.
Mr. Millaney? <+++++> Yeah.
Why do you think I blew up your condo? <+++++> What?
I didn't do it. <+++++> Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
I did? <+++++> Yeah. We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons. But how did you know that?
Ready? <+++++> Nods.
You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me? <+++++> Only if you try to grab me. We could've shot you from the wall.
-- In magazines nobody reads. <+++++> I read the one about the penal colony.
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am. <+++++> I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get.
I need something to persuade her that I was there. Get me something to take to her. <+++++> Ok. Ssh. Rest.
Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery. <+++++> Jesus!
Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight. <+++++> What the hell are you talking about? What's happening.
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes. <+++++> Really?
I'm trying to tell you. <+++++> Alright. Go ahead.
What do you think of that, Jabez? <+++++> Looks right elegant, Mary.
Consider it gone away. She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway. <+++++> Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche? <+++++> I'm thinking about it.
Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'? <+++++> Now, what would I be trying to say?
Isn't it true that without Esparza, you had no investigation? <+++++> I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
Like what? <+++++> Like my homework.
 <+++++> We understand your concern, but we've made our decision, Doctor. Any questions? Anybody?
You could always take it off. <+++++> It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
And so you feel nothing. <+++++> It's better that way.
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife. <+++++> And you agreed?
No. <+++++> Not good enough.
How's this going to work? <+++++> Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband? <+++++> Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test.
No. Sorry. Not interested. Not for my customers. Have you tried ... <+++++> No. No, you don't understand. We're not selling it. It came from here. We want ...
I'm not. <+++++> You just going to sit there?
I want to leave fast. <+++++> OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk.
What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ? <+++++> It's alright, I guess. You hear from anyone made it out of B.A. alive ?
Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help. <+++++> Catholic school, nasty.
KZ...7-0...7-0...nine. It checks out. <+++++> Excellent...excellent!
Your help? What are you talking about? <+++++> Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority. I can make them go away.
I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead. <+++++> Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood-- <+++++> I don't want you to--
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling - <+++++> I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
Sir, about leaving -- <+++++> We're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he can't just walk outside!
Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet. <+++++> Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way. Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
She wants her money back. <+++++> We're going to speak to her.
Just Johnny. <+++++> Stupid yourself.
Sleep tight. <+++++> Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Yeah. <+++++> The NSA killed him.
Well, either you are, or you aren't. <+++++> Right.
That's illegal, you know. <+++++> I know.
Holy... <+++++> Where's Dylan?! Have you seen him?
What's Gray to me. He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it -- the rest is forgotten. <+++++> You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
Right. You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'? I heard what you did with Kross. <+++++> It was a business decision.
So lemme see it. <+++++> Just let me get my coat off--I had eight cups of coffee, I'm wired for sound here.
You know what those guys are? Decent. Tell me, Herr Dr. FurtwÃ¤ngler, do you know Hans Hinkel? <+++++> Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
MMmmm. <+++++> So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean? <+++++> What do maniacs always want?
How are the kids? <+++++> Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.
You smashed it! <+++++> What? !
Give me some money. <+++++> I don't have any money.
You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing? <+++++> Turn this way. No, no... not you... YOU!
You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex? <+++++> No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
You and every person in this country. <+++++> Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
That's the thing 'bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What's troublin' you, sugar? <+++++> You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.
Claire is your wife? <+++++> Yes.
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions. I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe. <+++++> About what?
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute... <+++++> Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that. <+++++> Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay?
We got different information. <+++++> From who? Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
No last names, Jonah. Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers. How come you're up so late? <+++++> It's not that late in Seattle.
She's more than twenty-nine years old, Marty. That's what she tells you. <+++++> What, Ma?
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant. <+++++> Is that the last one?
Truth. Truth alone exists. Truth must be released... <+++++> You have no right! This is cosmic suicide!
Jeanne, look behind you. <+++++> Never look behind -- only ahead!
That's right, Joe. Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you. <+++++> You're sure?
Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything. <+++++> If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's? <+++++> Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
Her daddy touches her. His daddy never touches him. It would have been cooler if I'd died. <+++++> Wendy, I'll come back later.                                ]
Let's get married. <+++++> Huh? !
I have a plan. If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided. <+++++> What's your plan?
Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated. <+++++> I hear they're closing that post down.
Mm-hm. <+++++> Screwgie.
Here you go, Pete. <+++++> Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
You shouldn't be here. <+++++> I'm sorry, I --
I said, I've seen it before. <+++++> Alright.
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have. All else is just marking time. You're marking time. <+++++> I've had a few more concerns.
I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time. <+++++> I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a - <+++++> Nope.
Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins? <+++++> I didnÂt know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? IÂve known for five years.
Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries. I am a homosexual. <+++++> Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
That may be difficult... <+++++> Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable. <+++++> And then we're gonna do her right here. Right?
Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know. <+++++> At Sioux Falls Pen?
I don't know. Fly casual. <+++++> I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you. <+++++> Keeping fit then?
Hmmm . . . <+++++> Oh, stop that grunting.
I don't know what's going on. <+++++> It lends you an air of mystery.
You shouldn't judge, Brenda. <+++++> Right. Lap-dancers are people too.
Yes, sir. <+++++> Don't have to call me 'sir' neither... Nor grampaw neither...Nor Methuselah neither...I can whup you to a frazzle.
It's the first door on your left! <+++++> On the ledge?
If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh? <+++++> What do you think?
Paris. I live in Paris... <+++++> ...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
Tastes good. <+++++> No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
What ever happened to just bowling? <+++++> There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
You've done pretty well. <+++++> Not bad. I have other interests, of course.
Yeah let's hear about your day. <+++++> Well I got the tires rotated, I went shopping, and I made dinner.
Make sure everyone else does too... And Beckett: I want to know everything about his personal life. Did he frequent those pathetic bars on Camac Street? <+++++> Jesus.
I'm at the airport. <+++++> Good. Get to a phone.
Oh! Green Jack! What a dream I've had... proper nightmare. <+++++> Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human. <+++++> You're not going in there -- !
Right. <+++++> Then it's a deal.
No problem for me either. Honestly, it's no problem. <+++++> I'd really rather take care of it myself.
What do you mean? <+++++> Didn't show up.
Elaine! Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East. <+++++> Simon, why has he become so... so...
You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool. <+++++> Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler. <+++++> I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy. You come home, and nobody's here.
You think you've been working hard. This muther'll break your back. <+++++> This is a big day for the guards. They get to remind us who's boss.
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby. <+++++> I don't think we're ready.
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face. <+++++> Just call us Harvey. Can we get you a sandwich? A soft drink?
Nobody. <+++++> Well, what's the beef?
Lock this asshole up. <+++++> You think you can lock me up in this piss-ass prison? Hell, this place is motel fuckin' six to me.
Maybe you ought to wait here till they do. <+++++> Hey. I got a town full of beer bellies running around in the dark with shotguns. Who's gonna be next? Somebody's wife?
You're married. <+++++> Not anymore.
What do I have that you don't? <+++++> Everything. You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
Birdies... pretty... <+++++> I doubt the faeries will admire their beauty... Come, this will be fun to watch.
I'll take them all. <+++++> You must have quite some harem.
What if he doesn't run? <+++++> That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout. <+++++> People watched the movies in their cars?
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period. <+++++> I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
Did you talk to Exley? <+++++> Come in out of the rain. In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
Mrs. Peel -- ? <+++++> Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
Sure, Doc. <+++++> How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
What is that? <+++++> Cheerios and wieners. I made it myself. It's good.
After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter. <+++++> And have you any other truths to tell me?
It's the only way. <+++++> I refuse.
I've seen it on television. <+++++> I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
Huh? <+++++> To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
It's twelve-thirty! <+++++> I'm coming over.
Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid. <+++++> Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
You better not fuck this up. I'm heavily invested. <+++++> Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
Fine. Fine. <+++++> So I can go.
You shouldn't smoke so many of those. <+++++> I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.
Mary Clarence! <+++++> Keep moving!
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing. <+++++> Why not? You've done just about everything else on this operation.
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes. <+++++> They'll probably have a big net for us when we show up.
I'll know more once I get it under the microscope. <+++++> That's great.
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive. <+++++> Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.
Oh there you are. <+++++> Oh! You caught me.
Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement? <+++++> Fascinated.
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year. <+++++> Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
It's Grace. <+++++> May I carry your package, Grace?
By the way, Dr. Sattler - she's not like, uh, available, is she? - - <+++++> Why?
Well, thanks, that's great. <+++++> It is great, isn't it. See you tonight. Hey, Marty-- sexy cardy.
You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him. You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya. <+++++> All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
You're a son of a bitch. <+++++> Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology. Whenever you feel like it.
Then your father's a wimp. <+++++> And you're just poor white trash!
Yeah, we talked about sex, too. Oberon must be sweating in his sleep. <+++++> We had fun. I even got along with Talia-- for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much...
None. <+++++> Whose son this is, whose wife that is. A fiancÃ© is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time. Good night.
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to -- <+++++> It's okay, really.
What the hell is that? <+++++> Those are five hundred dollar chips.
No more fights. <+++++> Good. No more nightmares for either of us then.
Oh, I suppose so. <+++++> Could I have a puff?
A sort of retroactive abortion? <+++++> Yes.
I never saw him. I don't think anyone saw him. <+++++> He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
You're really serious, aren't you? <+++++> Yes, I am.
In certain cases, hell is the operative word. <+++++> Giff - shuttup. you're mother was a sweet child, Rowan... A lost little girl in a world too full at things
Why not? <+++++> It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue. <+++++> Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing? <+++++> Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that.
I'm sorry, I'm late. <+++++> What's the hurry?
I came to you because I want nothing to affect our agreement; I wanted to clear everything I'm going to do with you, just in case. <+++++> You're a considerate young man.
You came through, Nicky. <+++++> I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia. [15] <+++++> You've very kind Mr. Lovett.
I want you to get swept away. I want you to levitate. I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish. <+++++> That's all?
Mmm. <+++++> Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
Do you? <+++++> Yes, I do.
You're marking us, Bill. <+++++> HEY, KID.
I turn on the camera. You start talking. <+++++> And you ask questions, right?
ThereÂs finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you? <+++++> Exactly! TodayÂs my day. Tomorrow will be my day. And the day after that? My day.
What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me? <+++++> Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could -- <+++++> Give me the god damn mirror!
Oh, I shouldn't have... <+++++> It's okay. Happened a long time ago. He was killed in a fire. In New Mexico.
Yes. <+++++> Well, as long as we're stuck here.
You're going sailing. <+++++> Maybe.
We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'! <+++++> Oh, yes, assa parful new force.
Who is she? <+++++> Nobody.
Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling! <+++++> What would you think of me if -
Was I? <+++++> Yes, you were. A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please. <+++++> More popular than Uncle's Day at a whorehouse. GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS BRIGHT! BLUE BRIGHT.
What's that? <+++++> I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick.
Certainly not. <+++++> Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay. <+++++> Bye.
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing... <+++++> Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming? <+++++> I don't want to.
He was just plain dumb. As for you, Ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van. <+++++> But, Max --
Just like old times? <+++++> Just about..
You're a wise guy--Gimme back-- <+++++> Shortie, look!
See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank. <+++++> No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
From who? <+++++> I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy.
Lemme tell you something. Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts. Nobody even know what he looked like until now... <+++++> I don't know...
What? <+++++> And here's your goddamn severance!
I thought I told you to move that truck! <+++++> Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass -- <+++++> Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
A countdown to what? <+++++> Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike.
WeÂre hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned. <+++++> And now, drum roll please...
Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd guarantee ya your money back. <+++++> I'm not talkin' about your damn word, Jerry. Geez, what the heck're you?...
We've got it... <+++++> ...on ice! We've got Elvis on ice!
What about us? <+++++> There is no us, remember?
You watch that mouth. <+++++> I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh?
This part isn't about the virus, is it? <+++++> Hey, man...
You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking? <+++++> One beer with lunch is hardly "drinking".
Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ... <+++++> ... we're the bait.
Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers. <+++++> But who is left?
Who? <+++++> Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, andÂ <+++++> I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.
They're not guns. They're particle throwers. <+++++> Yeah, yeah. I just want to see 'em.
What have I done? I was dirt poor and useless... but I was honest. <+++++> Lighten up, John. You think <u>you</u> got problems for Chrissake?
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know. <+++++> Heard where?
How's business? <+++++> Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.
M'hm. <+++++> so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
You think there's more? <+++++> Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967.
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me. <+++++> Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
Can you find her? <+++++> You're looking at a Level III search. For your Level III, you gotta have E-4 authorization. I don't have it.
That's not our intent -- <+++++> -- a veritable freak show for tourists and curiosity seekers. Charenton is a sanatorium; she is not a circus. The theater is henceforth closed.
Put on another one. <+++++> That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
Do you miss it? <+++++> It's so far in the past now. Over fifteen years --
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep? <+++++> Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
You're welcome to join our club. <+++++> Did you hear what I just said? !
Anyone not in your family, is a stranger. Believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you. <+++++> That's how it was in the old world, Pop, but this is not Sicily.
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account? <+++++> Good question.
What do you think? <+++++> You're an idiot.
We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down. <+++++> It should, or it will? Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it? <+++++> Not at all.
OK...good night Mr. De Santis! <+++++> Good night Walter.
Tomorrow. <+++++> Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
What? <+++++> You heard me. You two, especially.
This is so noble. <+++++> Well no, it's not noble, but it's a good aid to your lesson.
I don't even know what I'm looking for! <+++++> Fuck it! Hold tight!
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein. I'm dictating it. <+++++> I can't take shorthand.
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey. <+++++> Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli...
--be prepared. <+++++> We don't have time!
That Sword has served me through many an evil time, Ben Harper. <+++++> What religion do you profess, Preacher?
They're not bad. <+++++> No, they're not. I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick. Eat your damn imitation hot dog. <+++++> This is no imitation. Removing the hot dog from the Ultradog yields a better dog. Behold -- Ultradog, no dog.
Not the way I can. <+++++> That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
Yeah? what did they want? <+++++> They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey? <+++++> This is it.
Damn, this is sweet. We are going to be home in no time. <+++++> Better grab up some sand to take home to your family.
What Mr. Parker? <+++++> She never ate a slice.
 <+++++> I'll get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater.
Unkillable. But now I believe that is going to change. <+++++> How?
Dignan, it's -- <+++++> Plus where's Huggie Bear?
Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I? Who are you? <+++++> I am Jenny Haydn.
But <+++++> You always been this selfish?
I ain't got the money. <+++++> No.
Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just joking around. <+++++> Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take a joke, man?
What do you mean? <+++++> I'm tired of playing overseas. Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you. <+++++> Where am I going?
What did she do? <+++++> She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.' 'Kathy Costello...'
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume. <+++++> And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
What's your new book about? <+++++> A detective. He falls for the wrong woman.
What's on the other end of this thing? <+++++> Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D.
I'll get you out of there. <+++++> No... don't...
Well, I hope youÂre not too heartbroken and... <+++++> Oh no. IÂm all right. He was a jerk, really. Another boy, you know? All I meet is boys.
Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes. <+++++> You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan. In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
Mornin'. <+++++> Is this your establishment?
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather? <+++++> Of course, he's concealed about me person.
What about the bogyman? <+++++> There is no such thing.
What? <+++++> Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
Rufus. She's a precog. <+++++> She's a precog?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice. <+++++> Still, it must be kinda rough.
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and -- <+++++> Forget it. We work for it. We keep it.
Did you ever have a roll in the hay? <+++++> I'm not sure I...get your drift.
Just give me a chance, will you? <+++++> I'm trying to be delicate with you, but you're not understanding me.
 <+++++> Dunbar.
You play an instrument? <+++++> No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone.
Pearl and John. <+++++> John and Pearl!
He just said he had good reasons. <+++++> Good reasons?
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>. <+++++> Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order. <+++++> Aye, sir.
Clo-Clo? <+++++> I thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act.
You killed her! <+++++> No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
He says that his father's hurt. <+++++> If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it! <+++++> I can't listen to this.
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him. <+++++> I think you're looking at him.
Where is she? <+++++> Up in the room.
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances. Why, this kid's got a record. <+++++> So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make?
Why? Is he staying? <+++++> With his Sergeant. A Mr. Hardy.
Joan or Margaret Smith. <+++++> Right.
Folks come. Folks go. <+++++> Here, let me carry that.
We just did. <+++++> Come on, you can tell me. I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
Business or pleasure, Mr. Price? <+++++> My wife. Where were we?
Triplets. <+++++> Really? - God, how time flies!
And he is living proof. <+++++> No, I think maybe you've been right. I think I may have been too critical in the past.
Yes. <+++++> Been here long?
Oh, good. <+++++> I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
Yeah, cool. <+++++> You think it's cool?
Earn your money. ...He's ill, the Plane is sick... <+++++> ...Good...
Yeah. <+++++> I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American. <+++++> But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they "blundered" into Berlin in 1918.
Too busy closing big, important dealsÂ  I think I will have a drink. <+++++> Good for you. Come on.
Yes it does. <+++++> I been meaning to tell you, far as I'm concerned you're over the hill.
Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force. <+++++> But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable. <+++++> I forgive you.
Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does. <+++++> I can't.
Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer -- <+++++> You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill. <+++++> If you hunt, you kill.
Just don't tell me you "owe me one." What file? <+++++> Double homicide. A year ago. Las Halloween.
You murdered that girl, Eddie. Six years ago... <+++++> What the fuck are you.. ?
Oh shit, what's today? <+++++> Today is Tuesday. What?
What color were the original Hebrews? <+++++> I told you we don't know for certain.
Like what? <+++++> You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
Telegrams? <+++++> No, Doctor.
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now? <+++++> I'm asking for real. I want you to turn that camera off and make love with me. Will you?
I'm a documentary filmmaker. <+++++> Oh? Anything I might have seen?
I do what I gotta do to survive. <+++++> You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.
Hi. <+++++> Hello Marylin.
Leave. <+++++> Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Did the cleaning woman come? <+++++> Yeah -- she did a good job. This glass looks brand-new.
Got a casualty list? <+++++> Just their side. What're we gonna do with these people?
Have you no shame? <+++++> Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
They won't let him die. <+++++> You want to bet?
I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate. Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here. <+++++> Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
Just like I knew it would be. He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that! <+++++> Well, come on, then. What are we waiting for?
Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu. <+++++> Thanks.
I don't know where he is. He's out on a call and he'll be out all night. How old are you? <+++++> My parents know I'm out. They know I'm here.
THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS... <+++++> SIDDOWN, YOUNG LADY! I DONE YUP A SHIT-LOAD O' FAVOURS AND I AIN'T NEVER YET ASKED FER NOTHIN' IN RETURN!
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me. <+++++> Uh-huh.
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby. <+++++> Don't think about it too long. You had enough?
Superman will return it. <+++++> Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead.
You know you're really very good. I take back what I said. I mean, you're really good. <+++++> Thank you.
I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you. <+++++> The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me?
This prom is a real drag. <+++++> Oh-huh.
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too? <+++++> Yes.
Hildy! <+++++> Huh!
John don't like him much. <+++++> Pearl dotes on him.
I resign. <+++++> You need treatment, Mrs. Peel. You can't resign.
We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie! <+++++> That's nice, Stan.
From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times... <+++++> Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking.
Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't. <+++++> That's enough.
What brought this on? <+++++> I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.
He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price. <+++++> No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.
May I please have another little kiss? <+++++> Walter! Jeez!
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ? <+++++> He wants money.
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people. <+++++> I see you.
Mr. Gittes... <+++++> Now, Mrs. Mulwray, what seems to be the problem?
Now you and David... <+++++> No. They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
Is that so? <+++++> My father. William Turner?
How can you be so certain? <+++++> The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
Let's talk about -- <+++++> I just realized this is for television, isn't it? I can't swear up and down like I just did.
Well, I better get going. Hit those stairs again. Was that a looping right or an uppercut the first time you caught him? <+++++> Looping right! I never swung wild. I was strictly a short puncherÂ hooksÂ over 'n underÂ  Â whop-whop!
I know. <+++++> Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
Why would he contact me? I just took some lousy pictures. <+++++> So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
What do you mean? <+++++> The quiet can fool you. It fooled me. You can never be sure of what's out there.
Into Stargher. Inside... <+++++> Yes.
Miss Ida Sessions again. She says you know her. <+++++> Okay.
Oh -- I almost forgot. Your head. <+++++> It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
Where to? <+++++> I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped. <+++++> But my sleeping is really fucked up.
A couple of weeks. It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading. <+++++> Is it getting worse?
Leave the pills. I'll take them later. <+++++> Sorry.
You believe that? <+++++> You think bad, and bad is what you get.
 <+++++> Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
See does he want some. <+++++> Do you want some food?
We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW. <+++++> Let me think. I need time to think.
You wouldn't even know where to get one. <+++++> Wanna bet?
I beg your pardon? <+++++> Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle.
What's the matter? Where's your husband, young ladyÂ <+++++> Husband?
Well Filmore-- <+++++> Well Cooper...
What're you saying? <+++++> Ummmmm, look, I...I...
You don't got a headache? <+++++> ...Nah.
You're the one who doesn't care, Phil. <+++++> It hurts too much to care.
You own this place? <+++++> This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires.
No way. <+++++> Cut some kind of a deal. I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm.... <+++++> Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
Sit down, Frank. <+++++> No. Miss Lawson came in here voluntarily to answer your questions. She doesn't have to sit here and be insulted.
Jesus God... <+++++> What is it?
Growls a reserved greeting. <+++++> Right.
- little things here and there, it doesn't matter. You can be proud of yourself, you've got a right to be. <+++++> Are you proud of me, Bill?
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my-- <+++++> Hello! Do you speak English? Parla usted Inglese? I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
Listen to yourself...  Don't worry, it's alright. We'll find him. What's wrong with you? <+++++> She left the fucking gate open.
Apollo? <+++++> Yeah, I can't beat him.
Okay. <+++++> Would you?
Did you want one? <+++++> Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that. <+++++> Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired.
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately. <+++++> But you're my father -
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly... <+++++> Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
Val? What the hell you doing back already? <+++++> Burt, get out! Get up on your roof or someplace! We found out what's been killing people! They're under the ground!
You saw West, right? How was he killed? <+++++> Full clip to the body --
And who may you be? <+++++> Edward Wood, Sir.
I'm not sure. <+++++> Let me ask you that again. This time, look around and consider your options.
Would you call this a code 100? <+++++> I'd double it and add 20.
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was. <+++++> Don't be. Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
Aren't they? Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and -- <+++++> Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries. <+++++> Tapestries?
'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat. <+++++> No hard feelings?
That's not entirely -- <+++++> Then what? My boobs are too big?
Helping you, sir? <+++++> We always help our friends, don't we? It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy.
Do you think this was worth waiting all day to see? <+++++> Is he cleaning house?
This one's for both of us. <+++++> Sleepless and Son. Baltimore.
Hello Tubbs. Can I come in? <+++++> Yeah, c'mon in...you scared the hell out of me!
Nothing. <+++++> You want to make a kiddies bet?
I see a flower. And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt. <+++++> Yeah.
You're so easy. <+++++> Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky? <+++++> Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
Whaddup. Money? <+++++> I was going to buy a slice.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves. Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that? <+++++> The key, Wade.
It's the only way it makes sense. <+++++> I hope you're well.
Can you say it? <+++++> Huh?
3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida. <+++++> Thank you very much.
You're not gonna see him again. <+++++> What... what makes you think you can order me around? !
You too. <+++++> Smokin' what?
Wow. <+++++> Take your shower.
Just giving the facts. <+++++> I'm calling the police.
I'll keep in touch. <+++++> I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game. <+++++> Well, what do you really think, though?
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...? We don't even know - <+++++> Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far? <+++++> Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
What do my eyes see? <+++++> It's starting....
What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice? <+++++> Here we go again.
Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life. Why don't you develop a useful skill? <+++++> Yeah, like turning into a beautiful woman.
Never. <+++++> How could anybody behave like that?
Go on, child. <+++++> Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante.
Oh, yes, please. <+++++> Go back to Bulgaria.
I'm new...I was born yesterday. <+++++> Tell me about it.
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first. <+++++> Right.
Hello. Wendy. <+++++> Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere. <+++++> My old man, he bought into the system, and it screwed him. So he swallowed a bullet.
I don't know no Tod. <+++++> What girls you got here?
They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come. <+++++> I'll tell you how come. The Barrack Chief gave them the green light. And you, our Security Officer, said it'd be safe.
The ear is from a missing person maybe? <+++++> Maybe so.
Well, who's got access to it? <+++++> I guess I'm the only one.
Tell me about it. <+++++> He was just doing his job.
I'm curious about something. I'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at. <+++++> Wh . . . what are you talking about?
Kinda'. <+++++> It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
John, it will not be easy. <+++++> Nigel, you'll just have to use your hands-
I'm curious how you did this with such economy. <+++++> Everybody has a weakness.
What? ! <+++++> Wanna be a part of history?
Pardon me... my mistake. Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ? <+++++> Whoops... don't mind me. Go ahead and finish up.
You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are? Who do you think you are...? <+++++> Hold on a second.
 <+++++> 
Miss Wollsten shares the room with you? <+++++> No, that's Thea's bed. Miss Wollsten's bed is in there.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy. <+++++> It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
With what motive? <+++++> Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
Sure. <+++++> You hustlin' me?
Willard... <+++++> It's not a guy...
You do? <+++++> Yeah.
That should make her happy. <+++++> Who's she?
It was the other guy who busted me. <+++++> 'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court.
You're an asshole, Moran. <+++++> I want Taupin.
Then they should speak up. <+++++> Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
I don't know. There's only one way to be absolutely sure. <+++++> Yeah, like what?
We've got to have a talk, you and me. <+++++> All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin... <+++++> ... we've got a committee meeting.
Perhaps the fall... <+++++> There's one other thing. I feel..
You. <+++++> Would you settle for pepperoni?
How are you? <+++++> Scarred for life, that's how I am!
He said they're charging us with murder. <+++++> Eeuww.
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon. <+++++> You're shittin' me.
Nope. <+++++> Even when you were young?
Ernie's. <+++++> All right. You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie.
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do? <+++++> Get married, apparently.
That's not a lot. <+++++> It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.
The new Queen lives. <+++++> Turold's son was to marry her.
What about me? <+++++> Here!
Mac, can you hear me? Come in? <+++++> Taylor, you surprise me.
<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I? <+++++> You're the star.
You sure you want to know this? <+++++> Yes.
That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...? <+++++> The days of the storefront grocery are numbered. I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
Genetic damage? <+++++> When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair. Viruses can damage DNA. So can radiation, certain chemicals.
...who root through...uh...presents, and... <+++++> What is it?
Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos. <+++++> If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them.
Really? <+++++> Yeah! He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing! He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!
Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us! George, something tells me our journey is just beginning. <+++++> Where are we going? Huh?
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again? <+++++> Hopefully sooner than later.
If they can give Kissenger the Peace Prize, I wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find I'd won the Preakness. <+++++> Well, yes, but the guy <u>did</u> bring Peace.
I don't know, with this case. <+++++> If you can, please call me. Please. I have to go now... goodnight.
No, Jor-El, the baseball player that came from Porto Rico. Yes Jor-El your Jailer. <+++++> The son of Jor-El on this Planet?
It does seem kind of odd doesn't it? <+++++> I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
They must have got their hands on a test vial! <+++++> What does that mean?
When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch. This is quite good. <+++++> What are they doing down here? In the bathroom? Suddenly appearing.
Main bus... <+++++> Ready.
Is she pretty? <+++++> Carlotta?
Feeling better? <+++++> They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before.
But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke-- <+++++> Yech...
This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he? <+++++> Oh, yes. Yes, he was.
Thelma, do you know where I could be in this business if I had a wife that entertained or went out socially-- <+++++> Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.
There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it? <+++++> Yes, I will.
Hey, easy... <+++++> We're a long way from high school, Carl...  ...and I'm scared.
You. Like the papers all say. <+++++> Pretty terrible shot.
Make any money? <+++++> No.
Are you there? <+++++> Yes.
I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there. <+++++> Yeah? You and who else?
What is it? A Disneyland thing? <+++++> No. I just kind of like the sound of it.
Did I miss something? Are we going into battle? <+++++> The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one. <+++++> Do you not like him like daddy?
I'm going in. <+++++> Here goes nothing.
I'm still here. <+++++> Well, then, talk to me some more.
I've got to go see Gruber. What's the best cigars you have? <+++++> Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault. <+++++> When was all this?
He's a moron. <+++++> He's my friend. He's not a moron.
You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed. <+++++> I had to limit your options.
White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol. <+++++> That's right.
Oh. Sorry. I was thinking. <+++++> What were you thinking?
So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this. <+++++> See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long.
It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois. <+++++> You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
I'm not the One. <+++++> Sorry, kid. You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
You don't have to work another day in your lives. <+++++> But how would we pay our bills?
C'mon, Joey. I'm just trying to help you hit a home run here. <+++++> Yeah? Well, you just struck out. It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way.
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen. <+++++> We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
What? <+++++> 
Good day, Doctor. <+++++> Good day, Major.
Huh? <+++++> Fuck off, frat boy.
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with. <+++++> Don't worry, four eyes.
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely -- <+++++> Huh?
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland? <+++++> No I haven't. Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
Beg pardon? <+++++> Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
No... <+++++> We can do it!
Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything? <+++++> It is just a regular card.
Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you? <+++++> I... I'll get the grits.
You're tense. What are you all uptight about? <+++++> You killed a man for no reason!
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend? <+++++> I don't understand 'friend.'
Thank you. <+++++> But mostly...
...is there? <+++++> How did you know I would be here?
Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend. Well, he'll have to wait his turn - <+++++> Hang on there -
What kind of a game? <+++++> You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question.
So! Sal is with you? <+++++> Sal? Yeah... Sal is with me.
No! You're not tearing me loose any more. <+++++> Do I have to spell it out?
So what makes you so special? <+++++> Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
What do you mean? <+++++> For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly. <+++++> My tits?
Don't worry what it says in the book. <+++++> Right.
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock? <+++++> I see. You're not just another pretty face..
The Corleone family wants to buy me out. I buy you out. You don't buy me out. <+++++> Your casino loses money. Maybe we can do better.
About the conspiracy? <+++++> I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
How're the hands? <+++++> They're fine.
We have to get through to the other side. You up for it? <+++++> I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company? <+++++> ABC...?
Hey! <+++++> Hold on a second.
I've told you before. I'd turn it down. <+++++> Would you really, Sam?
Please don't do it again. <+++++> I said I was sorry.
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists? <+++++> Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
How did I look? <+++++> Happy. Happy with a secret.
Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland. <+++++> FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?
Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire. Then his eyes focus on the fire. <+++++> Who is that horrible friend of yours?
Did to me? <+++++> Did to you and all the rest of you guys.
Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you? <+++++> Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
Norstars. <+++++> ...Who they playin'?
Because I can stop now if you want. <+++++> No. You could read a little bit more ... if you want.
Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours? ? <+++++> That's a tough choice.
It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths. <+++++> Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.
What's this? <+++++> It's a diary.
But there it is!... <+++++> A model, only as big as this.
That is...Chief Inspector Lee. The detective in charge of our investigation. <+++++> Put a diaper on him, Chin. I want to talk to the great Inspector Lee.
You okay? Kelly? <+++++> Yeah. Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore. <+++++> Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Viktor, but you're not exactly Cecil B. DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill. <+++++> Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer. Look it up.
I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her. Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh? <+++++> Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
I just talked to him. <+++++> So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.
George... Do you hear me, George? <+++++> What?
I am? <+++++> You're great.
I think it's time we got some professional help. <+++++> Like a detective.
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning. <+++++> I think he's already feeling better.
You beat him, kid. <+++++> You were right, Henry. It's not enough... But it's close.
They takin' water? <+++++> Yeah.
It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it. <+++++> Really? Why?
That sounds like me. <+++++> I am you, you little bastard.
You haven't changed. You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass. Well, guess what, it doesn't. <+++++> Then why are you so upset?
Can I trade in my car and take another? <+++++> You can do anything you've a mind to... and bein' a woman, you will! That yours?
GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN! <+++++> Franz! Help! Lunatic!
Yes, but what sort of a man? <+++++> I don't know.
Well, you know, Walt, I just wanted to say that anything I could do... <+++++> That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to <u>bother</u> you with...
But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that? <+++++> No. But that's why we hated him.
What's goin' on, Boss? <+++++> Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.
Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane? <+++++> Calvin said it was all right.
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on... <+++++> Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
What are we going to do with him? <+++++> Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas. Let's have that civilian stuff.
Does it say anything on the tape? <+++++> No, nothing.
We haven't looked in the barn, yet. Let's take a look. <+++++> Not now. I'm cold.
Do you mind if I drop off somewhere on the way? I've got an appointment, won't take five minutes... <+++++> Of course.
You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me. <+++++> Great.
Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission? <+++++> I'm a patriate.
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways. <+++++> Yeah, I definitely need to make you some CDs. At least while my kid is hanging out in there.
Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is. Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house. <+++++> That's all? Don't you want me to send some people over here?
Hello? <+++++> Oh. Sorry.
How did you find out? <+++++> My husband.
No. It's a mess. <+++++> Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you.
You made a liar out of me, Neil! Now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting. <+++++> Father, I have the main part. The performance is tomorrow night. Father, please.
You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead. <+++++> Nonsense. You're a fey creature with mad ideas. But you have a wildness that holds me to you, lass.
A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying... <+++++> Try stupid.
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep. <+++++> Then what is it?
What was your Party number? <+++++> If you are going to bully me like this, Major, you had better do your homework.
I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you. <+++++> You know that's not what's upsetting me.
We don't know. <+++++> Explain that.
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like-- <+++++> I don't care, just get me there.
Huh? Oh. Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles. <+++++> Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum. <+++++> A hundred.
Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle? <+++++> I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
We're going to Ben's. The phone never just rings at a police station. <+++++> No way. No how.
She didn't push me into coming. <+++++> Why are you doing this to yourself?
Can't be good news coming from you. <+++++> Pulled night duty. Trimble's sick.
And what do you think Mendez? <+++++> Well, I surely know what a quadrant is! But I've never seen it used at night before.
Actually. I could only help him. <+++++> 
Marty... <+++++> You started filling out your college applications yet?
Me. My home number is on this card. <+++++> His home number.
But don't pull that again. <+++++> Wouldn't dream of it.
Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther. <+++++> All the bears gonna be walking today.
Shut up. How can you eat like that? <+++++> Big bites.
What?! But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records... <+++++> Let me explain something...
Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach. <+++++> Got it.
And we really do have to talk. <+++++> You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
The chest-cutter. <+++++> Yeah, that's right. You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
They destroyed the simulator room and you with it. <+++++> The <u>Kobayshi Maru</u> scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment. As I recall you took the test three times yourself.
She's not out for a pleasure cruise. <+++++> She's a predator.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death. <+++++> Because... because...
Once the wound healed up...  Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man. <+++++> How'd you know I'd do it.
Grifters... <+++++> We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
Pain causes it? <+++++> Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway. You get it?
I'm sorry. <+++++> Don't be. It was worth it.
I haven't been a detective for four years. <+++++> You don't say --
I'm not a scholar, Dottore. But it seemed as if they, as if they... <+++++> Yes, I think I amused them. To what do I owe...?
That's an extremely negative response. <+++++> Yes, Janet. Leave the crying to Brad.
I'll bet. <+++++> Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
Will be. <+++++> You ain't nothing but an old fool.
How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George? <+++++> You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well. <+++++> You need to explain it.
Indeed we are. We'll continue the interrogation there. <+++++> I ain't tellin' you nothin'! Get me Santino.
When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough. <+++++> Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
So much. <+++++> It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
I don't have to. I've got them right here. <+++++> Put them on the table.
Mueller was alone in the cabin? <+++++> Yeah.
Bullshit! <+++++> Bullshit yourself!
 <+++++> Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
What are your plans? <+++++> Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease. <+++++> Disease? What disease?
A married lady. <+++++> With the paper to prove it.
You too, preacher? <+++++> I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
Why did you stay on the bus, Walter? <+++++> I fell asleep.
Hooray! We're off to see a Wizard! <+++++> Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
Under the table. <+++++> I'll take his place, all right? Put the gun to my head.
...Ed? <+++++> Huh?
It's a miracle. <+++++> Look, guys--I'm a man, I got needs too.
I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons. <+++++> Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker!
Have you notified the police? <+++++> No, sir. I didn't want the publicity. Harry's homecoming tomorrow . . .
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons. <+++++> Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.
What are you so crazy about the movies for? <+++++> It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall.
Don't. <+++++> I believe you still have my book.
I'll be at the wheel myself. <+++++> I'll slip in, talk them into to come out, and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them.
He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house. <+++++> Harry always shows his good side and, like the moon, the other side is black.
Wait. I have to tell you something. <+++++> What?
That girl, she works at the casino -- <+++++> -- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine.
Yes! <+++++> Yeah!
Barton. Are you all right? <+++++> No... Can I come in?
Here. Go down the cellar and check the fusebox. <+++++> Will you come with me?
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately. <+++++> Good, I hate long waits.
That one is a bit more difficult. <+++++> Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait... <+++++> WAIT FOR WHAT! ?
Yes. We have heaven. <+++++> Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
Carrots. <+++++> Raw?
He'll weasel out of trouble. Again. <+++++> Maybe. I could have stopped it, though.
Good. I want to talk to you. <+++++> That's jolly.
Then, where are you going? <+++++> Nowhere. [Beat] I just think I'm gonna be sick.
Would you mind moving along, please? <+++++> Yes, you're in the way. He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.
Ahh, nothing. <+++++> I could swear I heard...
About what? <+++++> Ever since you have been back from Paris...
Specialty store down in Sacramento. <+++++> Uh-huh.
But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann. <+++++> I can't say he was anybody!
Claire-- <+++++> I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
She's plastered, isn't she? <+++++> She'll snap out of it. Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody. Sooner.
It's Marvosa - <+++++> What do you need?
When? When did you ever see me use? <+++++> This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
What you think? <+++++> Nice.
Pop. I'm sorry. <+++++> It's okay. What happened?
You don't say. How real does it feel? <+++++> As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
On the phone. Was it for you? <+++++> I don't know, he didn't say anything.
Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this. <+++++> Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about? <+++++> Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
Asshole! ! <+++++> Where did you learn that?
Defense against what? <+++++> There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before? <+++++> I don't think so.
They're your favorite flower. <+++++> How did you get so many?
[What's the PIN number?] <+++++> [The what?]
That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there. <+++++> You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari. <+++++> Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
Yeah, I guess. <+++++> Great. On my fucking room.
Run for your lives, boys! It's That great two-gun dog-catcher From Kansas! <+++++> McMasters, isn't it? Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-
We can head back for our lines, and they don't even have to know about the gold. <+++++> Epps. What if they're not Saudi.
You don't have any!! ! <+++++> That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please? <+++++> No. Hell no.
Things? What kind of things? <+++++> I mean...things. Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--
Celebrating. Join me? <+++++> The party's over.
Who you calling? <+++++> Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason.
Then droppen Sie dead! <+++++> Ja -- ja! Droppen Sie dead! Always mit the jokes! Droppen Sie dead!
And started to run. <+++++> Good thinking.
And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need. <+++++> Wait...Did you say off-season?
Really? <+++++> Really.
Send that? <+++++> Would you?
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it." Almost makes you worse. <+++++> What do you want? You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque." <+++++> "Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ? <+++++> Do you think the assistant, what's his name...
Nuwanda? Please? <+++++> All right! I'm thinking!
Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ... <+++++> Sure.
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!! ! <+++++> -- You're not making sense!! What "Scarecrow"?
I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim. <+++++> Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone? <+++++> Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more.
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal. <+++++> Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work?
I can't leave. You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report. I don't have an alternative future. <+++++> But you still have a choice. The others never had a chance to see their future. You did.
Where are you going? <+++++> I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job. <+++++> I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
No they're not. <+++++> Annabelle put down that camera.
I want to be alone. <+++++> That is not so -- you don't want to be alone.
Would you call him a capable man? <+++++> Very.
I stay in my own yard. <+++++> Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret.
They left. I'm sorry. <+++++> Was it a boyfriend of yours?
How would you know that? <+++++> He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think.
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child. <+++++> Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it.
They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm. Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel. <+++++> But what about Thomas?
I'm Opal. <+++++> Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
Hallelujah, Jaffar. <+++++> So you're not just talkin' mob guys. You're talkin' anyone, right? Even like pimps and drug dealers and all that shit?
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for. <+++++> Hah! You don't know me, boy.
I guess you have your reasons. <+++++> Yes.
No Sir. <+++++> Got your license?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you. <+++++> Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
So what was the theme of the pageant last year? <+++++> Last year? It was, "Buy American."
We could... <+++++> Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.
Why don't you come back with me? <+++++> Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
Are they on the phone still? <+++++> Yeah... yeah!
Something like that. <+++++> That was terrific.
Charlie M. <+++++> Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!

Stu? <+++++> Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
Don't hurt him. <+++++> Where's the nearest hospital?
Wbat're you talking about? <+++++> Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. FiftyÂfifty.
Kit... <+++++> Everybody keeps starin' at me.

Now what? <+++++> Jump!
Ok. Well. I'm gonna go out of town. I'm going to go out of town just for two days... <+++++> Where you goin?
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me? <+++++> All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
What time? <+++++> Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
Facts, facts, facts. <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier. <+++++> ...a case, so, so <u>fascinating</u>, so...
Well, fine, fine. Fiddle da dee. And how's it working? <+++++> Like... clockwork.
How was I? <+++++> Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
Neo, please, you have to trust me. <+++++> Why?
You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now. <+++++> If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
What would you do...? <+++++> I like the diminished risk. It frees up capital reserves. I like working with self-interested businessmen who are competent. You can predict their behavior....
When did you hear? <+++++> 'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged. <+++++> They shouldn't have been out this way, that's all I'm saying.
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time? <+++++> I won't be staying.
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station. <+++++> Have you seen it?
I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here. <+++++> You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
Walker and Williams. <+++++> What did you say your name is?
You... you... you mortal you! <+++++> Please...
No. She shall not be left here. <+++++> Maybe you're right. Help me get something to carry her downstairs.
Terrific. <+++++> But what we need is national coverage. It's difficult with this Falklands madness going on.
What brings the rats out of the sewers? <+++++> I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in. <+++++> You abide by rules like that?
Who is it? <+++++> It's Beaumont.
1, 2, 8; 2, 8, 1. I git 'em all? <+++++> I'll take your goddam bet.
I feel bad for his family. <+++++> Yeah.
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me? <+++++> In a minute.
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out -- <+++++> There's a tunnel.
Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10. <+++++> Maybe he's a cyborg.
He couldn't, or refused to pay. We extended credit... <+++++> Look, where is he? !
Five thirty. Okay. <+++++> Try not to be late because kids donÂt like to be the last one picked up.
Well as a matter of -- <+++++> I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there.
Three twenty-five. <+++++> Three twenty-five.
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain. <+++++> What'd you expect? That's his job.
What is your job title, exactly? <+++++> Excuse me?
No offense. <+++++> Manray needs a job.
Go. IÂm sorry, you should just go... <+++++> No, youÂre right. What are we doing?
Told you I could write an ending. <+++++> Congratulations.
Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you. <+++++> How about letting the people out of the bank. Why put them in this position?
Doesn't matter. <+++++> C'mon. Let's get out of this rain.
C'mon, it all worked out. You came out okay in the end... <+++++> I did? What do I tell a source on the next tough story? Hang in with us. You'll be fine... maybe?
We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out. <+++++> What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
After the funeral I just had to leave. <+++++> Had to leave? Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what? We stayed.
Sounds like you know the job. <+++++> I've done it once or twice.
Did it leave? <+++++> Actually, I don't know...
He's got a houseboat. <+++++> I hate boats.
You mean it? <+++++> I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently.
I'm sorry Charlie. <+++++> Save it.
Mr Poe? <+++++> Miss. May I?
I'm gonna roll him off the hood. Always lift with your legs... <+++++> I don't think I can do this.
Did he just say what I think he said? <+++++> You voted for him.
You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use? <+++++> A forty-five.
How far is Amarillo? <+++++> 350 miles.
I haven't decided yet. <+++++> The woman's health is at stake.
Supportive? You weren't being supportive. You were being scared. Just like now. You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on. <+++++> Lost!
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say! <+++++> I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling! <+++++> Anytime you want to go home, Sergeant...consider yourself dismissed.
Thanks. <+++++> For that matter, I might as well be a girl scout tonight. I plan on making popcorn and watching Doctor Dementia.
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car? <+++++> I sold it this morning. I'm going to take cabs from now on in.
We're ready, sir. <+++++> Thank you, Scotty. Stand by.
You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio-- <+++++> 
Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville? <+++++> Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you? <+++++> Why?
Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan. Move. <+++++> My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone! We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
Seems to be all around... <+++++> What about down?
My stomach's growling. <+++++> There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
Hurry up man. Let's be out. I wanna go swimmin'. <+++++> Hold up man.
Relax, man! No physical harm intended! <+++++> Who the fuck are you? Why've you been following me? Come on, fuckhead!
We take the money. Ethan takes the blame. No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him. <+++++> Of course - IÃ­m sorry to hear you say that Claire.
You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway. How are your kids handling the new house? <+++++> Good. You have kids?
Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here. <+++++> You're a weasel.
Look at the kid. In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit. <+++++> Yeah? So?
What! <+++++> They were probably topping off a docked tanker while he stalled for time--without anyone being the wiser...
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line. <+++++> I lost him? I lost him?
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand? <+++++> Why? So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
You are not dead, boy. Accept it. <+++++> This is monstrous. I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They -- <+++++> "Quick pull off the highway" is not a relationship. Oh man, I gotta pee.
How's David? <+++++> How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
Like you were trying to get away. Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself. <+++++> You watch me, don't you?
Alright. You want me to get your old job back? Because I could, you know, I could put in that word. <+++++> No, Dad. I don't want to...I mean, I just don't want...
No, I guess not. <+++++> 'Drugged' is a stupid word.
I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance. <+++++> Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could. She called it opening new doors. <+++++> Can you give the court an example?
You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit. <+++++> Andy! No!
You said they didn't have night guards. <+++++> They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection. <+++++> All the same killer?
What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar. <+++++> Me? After Sugar?
Yes, sir... <+++++> You oughta be tired, too, Sounder. That possum shore whipped the hell outta you tonight!
Was the child full term? <+++++> Oh, Dear God...
Minors aren't allowed at fights. <+++++> Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.
Fine.. <+++++> Learn anything?
You just got to get yourself a good lawyer. And some money... Talk to Max. He's been in the longest. <+++++> How long?
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight. <+++++> Send me a kiss.
Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that. <+++++> Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
No, on the campus. I haven't any family. <+++++> I come from a big one. Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system. <+++++> Go!
See you're back and still rocking the boat. <+++++> Somebody's got to.
And, where did you see my portrait? <+++++> Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.
Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone? <+++++> Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi. <+++++> Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor. Who are you?
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you. <+++++> I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night? <+++++> Well...sure.
Nah. <+++++> Why not?
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married. <+++++> Married? To Anna? You ain't got her in trouble?
No,  sir. It's more of a perceptual issue. <+++++> Perceptual?
He's a mean little sonofabitch, Edgar ... He had the IRS audit my mother when she was dying in a nursing home. <+++++> I know ...
Well I guess... <+++++> Yeah... Bedtime.
Is that a raincoat? <+++++> Yes, it is.
What do you mean? <+++++> I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals.
He's not home. <+++++> That's all right.
I see. And what would you do if "she" walked in her right now? WYATT "She"? <+++++> You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan.
Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there? <+++++> Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.
Good luck, Spud. <+++++> Cheers.
2t <+++++> So, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.
Pride of a job-well-done... <+++++> It's the Pride of a Job Well Done, Stanley, yes, but it's <u>more</u> than that.
Dom Wooganowski. Duh. <+++++> But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
Terrific. I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill. <+++++> I said I was sorry...
--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams... <+++++> Is this a dream? Tell me, Merlin!
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship? <+++++> It has entered Earth orbit. Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
Tonight. <+++++> You promise?
You sell anything? <+++++> Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own. We have to allow her space -- <+++++> Space for what? To O.D. like that other kid? I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.
Jesus! <+++++> Oh my God! Adrienne?
What? <+++++> Our own special bus.
What did you do that for? It makes him mean as a snake. <+++++> That dog was mean before I met him.
...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round... <+++++> ...dat's too much money. I can't 'ford it. I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...
They never got that big. <+++++> Baryonyx?
You really think so? <+++++> Absolutely! It's just the beginning. I promise this: If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous.
Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay? <+++++> Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
1322 last year in LA county. Up 26 percent from the year before. <+++++> That's right. And we nailed over a thousand of them. We did it by crunching data.
I've got heads here, Norman. <+++++> You promised you'd do the show.
Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable. <+++++> I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
Yes. <+++++> Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink?
I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count. <+++++> You're kidding, right?
Staring at us? <+++++> My mistake - she's glaring.
Good morning! <+++++> What do you mean, 'good morning'?
Go on home. Just leave me the money. <+++++> Go to hell.
Your home address. Oh, just the town will do. <+++++> Los Angeles.
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . . <+++++> Come to me, Superman! If you dare! I defy you! Come! Come, and kneel before Zod!
If you're too late, The Screamer comes. <+++++> How do you stop The Screamer?
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe. <+++++> I thought so.
I... I'm very sorry, but I never open. I'm very sorry but I never open the door to strangers after dark. <+++++> Very well, madam. I suppose you can't be blamed for being suspicious with so many scoundrels and rouges of the night about.
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy? <+++++> Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit. <+++++> I want you desperately!
Did you? <+++++> Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right. <+++++> Ain't worth thinking about.
A body. <+++++> I see that is a body! But where did you get it?
...I heard different, thought that was... <+++++> ...not that time...
Well! <+++++> Well, you're my pal, aren't you? Then don't turn female on me.
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat. <+++++> Well --
Is that a problem? <+++++> Not for you, clearly.
 <+++++> America has been good to me...
I think I recognize you. <+++++> How?
Yes. <+++++> Oh. Right.
She coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men struggle for the pin. <+++++> Don't say that about my mom!
Poor Delbruck! There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body. <+++++> Darling, you mustn't worry so.
Good plan. <+++++> But before that, I'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out.
I go with you -- <+++++> That what you want?
He was just having fun. <+++++> It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
They took a left at the next light! <+++++> You sure? !
But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice. <+++++> Choice? What kind of choice?
I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him. <+++++> I know, I did, but damnit Howard--  For the first time since I've known him, I think he's really humping...
My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it. <+++++> I'm here with you.
She's right. <+++++> Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
Goodnight. <+++++> Goodnight.
And stop threatening that boy. He doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert doesn't either. <+++++> Then who does?
You may be right. <+++++> Are you serious?
This time they mean to conquer, at all costs. <+++++> The Fortress moves?
Nope. <+++++> Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
No! <+++++> Just let me rest for a second.
Scooby? <+++++> Yeah?
Doesn't matter. The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing. <+++++> Well...all <u>right</u>! We just roll on out of here!
A hundred dollars! <+++++> The smallest thing I've got.
Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh? <+++++> Nah, nah, nah, nah.
I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should. <+++++> That barely covers the cost of his room. There's nary a penny left over for appropriate treatments. Opiates to quell his temper.
What'd I do? <+++++> You should be ashamed of yourself.
You're so easy... <+++++> Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough? !
Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you. <+++++> I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
Yes! That's it! You got it, you got it! Way to go, Chief! <+++++> I'm doing it! I'm doing it!
Uh, yes. <+++++> Meet me in front. Five minutes.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth? <+++++> I wonder if he's some kind of mutant. That bear had to be surprised.
Don't worry about that. <+++++> Jud, why am I doing all this?
Tell us about it... <+++++> 
Please do not be frightened, Madam. <+++++> What do you want here?
Gordo, if this is you, so help me... <+++++> What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
Millions - if anybody wants it. <+++++> The banks are out of luck, eh?
With me. <+++++> Apparently he's genuinely interested in science. This could be a chance to win him over.
Nice house for a shaman's daughter. You must be good. <+++++> Come here.
Sorry! <+++++> Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
Florentino! He's getting away! <+++++> Drop his horse.
How 'bout you? <+++++> *Some*body got to take the blame. They just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know.
I can't do this -- <+++++> What are you so afraid of?
No. <+++++> When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
I do? <+++++> You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one? <+++++> I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
If you got something to say, say it. <+++++> Anything happens to Huey it ain't gonna be a finger. I'll...
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything. <+++++> Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
Oh my God ...  Oh my God ... <+++++> David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
Yeah, I think so. <+++++> That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy. <+++++> You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency.
I just wanted to see her, that's all. <+++++> You rode your bike out there?
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel? <+++++> Or we could do that yeah.
 <+++++> There's nothing to talk about. Two goddamn times I made it with your old lady. We barely even talked.
Maestro. <+++++> Good morning.
You're hesitating. I think that means you have. <+++++> Shut up!! !
Give them some money and send them home. <+++++> Mike!
Right now. <+++++> Okay! Jesus!
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to... <+++++> Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me?
As long as it's working, let's leave it alone. It's been nice so far. We're together -- <+++++> -- Permanently?
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did. <+++++> 
That's what I need to ask you. You know you can't keep anything from me. <+++++> He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, "Did you really do this just today?" Cause I was impressed.
That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock. <+++++> Yes, I noticed.
Is me music not to your liking? Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure. <+++++> No... I... I need to rest.
Well, you were working there-- <+++++> It could have just been a box lunch from the jail.
He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him. <+++++> Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
Calm down. Tell me what's wrong. <+++++> Something awful happened last night.
... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy... <+++++> Oh, I see.
Really? <+++++> Hear me out. This person I've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married--
Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop. <+++++> I'm not waiting 48 hours.
Are you feeling better? <+++++> I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
So, it is a blacklist. <+++++> Don't say that. There is no such thing as a blacklist. Now, are you gonna play ball?
You idiot! Asta! Stop that! Get down! Now, stay there. <+++++> All right... shoot! I mean... what's on your mind?
It's rather a disappointment these days. It isn't there any more. <+++++> Sir?
She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all. <+++++> Exactly, and that's why she couldn't possibly have come from such a farm.
Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it. <+++++> Yeah. It's kind of a weird place, actually. A lotta wall space.
I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you. <+++++> You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics. <+++++> Get your story straight. This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.
Like it? <+++++> Yes. It reminds me of home.
No. <+++++> The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser.
Let me speak to Mr. Smith. I want to hear it from him. <+++++> Fuck you. I'm running this shit. You talk to me.
Miss Scarlett. In the broom closet. With the radio. <+++++> I gotta go. I'll see you at work. Walter, you scared me. Don't ever do that again.
The radio rig is inside. It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem. <+++++> Good.
I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it. <+++++> Winston Churchill.
Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom. <+++++> We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Not suede boots! <+++++> Knock it off, Gerald.
Two minutes, ten seconds. <+++++> Engine room! What's happening? !
Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes. I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe. <+++++> Lie back down, and try to -
You saved me. <+++++> I saved you because I love you, Nick. Why'd you save me?
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza? <+++++> No.
I want to hear everything he said. <+++++> I'm trying to tell you.
I want to talk to him. <+++++> He's groggy, Sonny. Let me get him on his feet and he'll call you back.
Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. Well... <+++++> Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it. <+++++> Oh, a little savage, is he?
You've done it before. Can't you remember? <+++++> The hell I can't
I can't go back to Vegas... <+++++> OPEN IT!! !
How long were you dating him? <+++++> I wasn't dating him. I was fucking him.
And then... what did she do? Agnes what did she do? <+++++> She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake.
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you... <+++++> No -- no -- no -- no...
I think you're different. <+++++> 
No. <+++++> Everyone at work heard you.
Sure. Count me in. <+++++> Good. Settled then.
I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome! Or for the glory of you! <+++++> I'm a soldier -- we're at war. I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway. <+++++> How come you got the kid with you?
I haven't any. <+++++> You haven't got a uniform?
It's Grady, Walter. <+++++> Grady?
Oh, no. No. No. I meant no scheme. I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory. It's just a thought. <+++++> Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!
I'm amazed. <+++++> Me, too. I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight. Nothing.
My God. Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair? I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers. <+++++> Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
They're dying. <+++++> LET THEM DIE.
Will you be okay? <+++++> Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
My father. <+++++> Yeah. He lives here, right?
Half a million. <+++++> Jesus.
Hiss was protecting his wife. I've always believed that. <+++++> When they know you've got something to protect, that's when they fuck you!
 <+++++> Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
Thanks for the great time. <+++++> What is this?
The Albacore Club. <+++++> It has to do with my father.
I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired. <+++++> That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers. <+++++> Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis. Her home office was ransacked. It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.
Now go kiss your daddy, quick. <+++++> That's why they cheer, you know. The white man sending the black man into battle...
Cabell was his deputy for nine years. Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop. Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou. <+++++> They're gonna love you, chief.
I know who you are. <+++++> There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption.
Elroy, what happen? <+++++> I threw my back, again.
Popup, on floorboards. And-- <+++++> In eye of that painting.
Negative. <+++++> Sir.
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible. <+++++> What?
He's three now. Course, not in that picture. <+++++> Oh, he's adorable.
Yes, I do. <+++++> You sure?
You - <+++++> Or in my chiffonier. I don't know.
You're sure nobody's following us? <+++++> As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done.
It should've been a union demand from the beginning. <+++++> Yeah.
Have you fantasized about me? <+++++> I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
Skip, that's not much of a secret. <+++++> It's not?
I'm the hired help. <+++++> Fuck you.
--but just as a kind of safety tip. <+++++> Yeah. I bet he would.
But what about all these other people? <+++++> We'll get 'em! Give us a chance. I'm not the only agent in here, ya know.
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor. <+++++> Shoot.
I don't want to hear it. <+++++> How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
What? <+++++> What's that noise?
All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters... <+++++> To all those cons...
There isn't any. <+++++> There's no risk?
-- please -- Jason -- omigod -- <+++++> -- quiet -- <u>quiet</u> --
You were right. She's still pissed. <+++++> Sweet love, renew thy force!
A sweet man. <+++++> Under the house.
Seventeen. She's a senior. <+++++> I'm not crazy about blind dates.
Wha...wha...wha... I try to be good; the only thing I care about is... <+++++> I know that...
I used to work at the Diplomat. <+++++> Do you know how to open the safe there? Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe.
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble? <+++++> Never. Why do you ask?
You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty... <+++++> ...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
You seem to like movies, Detective. <+++++> Call me Mark, would you? Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet. <+++++> Yeah.
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests. <+++++> Have you told your family?
Lies. <+++++> I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
They're fine... you miss it? <+++++> You must be joking.
How fast does it take effect? <+++++> Doesn't say.
Nudie booth? <+++++> Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it! <+++++> Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
Is this a fair mix? <+++++> I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
Oh hello. <+++++> You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
Rob. Don't be childish. <+++++> Why is that childish? Your living with the guy! I'm just asking how it's going.
You want me to try? <+++++> You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball. <+++++> Oh, yeah?
You got it on the board. <+++++> No, I need the original note.
Henry, what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding? <+++++> Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD. <+++++> WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
I know. <+++++> I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me. <+++++> I really don't know what to say. Look, I lie to women all the time. That's just my way.
Not exactly. <+++++> They were vampires, weren't they?
But... ? <+++++> 
We know these people...! <+++++> Grieve elsewhere.
Take me somewhere. <+++++> What?
Well... I don't know if I have or not. <+++++> Do you still want the operation?
Look daddy! It's empty! <+++++> That's great, honey.
We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour. <+++++> Don't you think I know it?
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out. <+++++> Well, there's a good amount of agreement on that.
Sandro ...What's the matter? <+++++> Nothing.
Who was he, Momma? He tried to kill us. <+++++> If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
Where did your brother escape from? <+++++> The mental hospital.
Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor? <+++++> It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. FurtwÃ¤ngler stood up to him.
It's makes it easier. Okay. <+++++> I don't want to know.
Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it. <+++++> Remember what I said when we first started -- this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you!
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port. Alotta meant nothing to me. <+++++> Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all? <+++++> I get crazy dreams and I black out.
Jersey? You know what the traffic's gonna be like? <+++++> I'm taking the train...
He wants to show now. <+++++> You going to let him? You going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to?
Not too sweet! You make it too sweet they don't eat it. <+++++> Make it the way I always do.
Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet? <+++++> Nobody will swim here until next summer.
Uncle, you can't do this! <+++++> My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere. War is not a woman's problem.
Why? <+++++> No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it! <+++++> No kiddin'. What's your idea?
He's my-my food taster. Have you two met? <+++++> Hi. How do you do.
Let's go in. <+++++> Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
I'm a little short. I've been out of work. Let me owe you the money for a few weeks. <+++++> Ah, you're a sharp young fellow. How is it I've never noticed you before  You're too quiet for your own interest.
There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us. <+++++> I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go.
Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married. <+++++> You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
Where is this thing that attacked your wife? <+++++> I hit it. I hit it with my cane.
Attic space. <+++++> Let's see. We could turn that into a media room.
Let's go outside and talk. We need to do that. <+++++> About what?
I said his heart, not his attention. <+++++> Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
You say look at you? <+++++> That's correct. Look at me.
I'll tell you when we get there. <+++++> Well. I'm glad we... WHOAA! !
You are so good to me. Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden? <+++++> You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
It won't sell. <+++++> Why not?
Can't we hold him? <+++++> No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him.
So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it. <+++++> But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
Then you've got nothin' to worry about. <+++++> You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
Just a guard. <+++++> I shot at one of them.
Yes? <+++++> Who's the old geezer?
You know a religious guy named John Paul? <+++++> You know Ruby is in Attica?
Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti. Do you know Nick Cardella? <+++++> No.
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids. <+++++> Nursemaid? !
She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart. <+++++> Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring!
Anglo husbands can also be backward. <+++++> Can be what?
How do they know? <+++++> What is your idea of being normal?
Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now. <+++++> Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good. <+++++> I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word? <+++++> "Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
Don't get hysterical, Norman. <+++++> I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
Back up. <+++++> Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman? <+++++> Dad...
Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards. I can change clothes at your place? <+++++> I suppose that would be okay.
He's a guest in my house, isn't he? <+++++> Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact. <+++++> ... My God...
We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it. <+++++> We've got to go now, then.
The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses. <+++++> You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
What? <+++++> Someone should stand up and strike back.
Better. <+++++> That's good. I knew it wasn't nothin'.
Case you think I come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has. <+++++> I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit.
Is it safe for human transport? <+++++> That's affirmative.
I didn't mean to hurt you. <+++++> Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years? <+++++> I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks. Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood. This is how they turned out. Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little. <+++++> Tell me about Patchett.
Just use the keyboard... <+++++> The keyboard... How quaint.
What's wrong? <+++++> I can't stand it. Oh God, I can't stand it!
Maybe they needed it. <+++++> I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
I'm glad I didn't have to kill you. I'm glad it didn't come to that. <+++++> Yeah. Well, me too.
I thought I told you to lose this guy. <+++++> Look, sergeant I know I said some things last time that I shouldn't have said at all but...
I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up. <+++++> Excellent point.
Who, Paul? What exactly ... ? <+++++> I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake.
What was what? <+++++> What's with you?
Actually, that's not true. <+++++> You didn't squeeze DePinto?
I've moved on. <+++++> No!
I am prepared to do that anyway. <+++++> 
Just do what I say, Bob. <+++++> Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle. <+++++> Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
Praetor. <+++++> Now go. I have some personal business.
I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay? <+++++> Um, yeah -- thanks.
That's the call that I'm waiting for. <+++++> What does it mean?
In Cheyene Walk? Lucy's going to have a meltdown. Oh, I'm so sorry. <+++++> I should have damn well bought it. Well, we can't afford it.
Eight children! <+++++> No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
... Uh, I hope this doesn't embarrass you. <+++++> Not at all. This is not going to leak, is it?
Why? If they could never take title. <+++++> Their kids was born here. So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it.
Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl. <+++++> Don't worry about it. You want anything?
Did I urinate on your rug? <+++++> You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
Who are you? <+++++> My name is Frankenstein...
Eighty. <+++++> Eighty bucks?! ?
And what project looms on the horizon, Walter? <+++++> Uh, I don't know.
So what's up with you? <+++++> What do you want to know?
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming. Do you mind? <+++++> Does it matter?
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya? <+++++> Nope. Never.
Now, what do you see? <+++++> Me? Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men.
So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled. <+++++> You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense. <+++++> Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies. <+++++> And a French alliance?
Yessir. <+++++> Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us? You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
I don't want to see them, Kathryn. <+++++> Michael, I don't have time. Please! It's time you dealt with this and got over it. Now come on!
Arrest him. <+++++> What is the...?
Not yet. <+++++> You and Harry'll make a great team. I'm gonna make a deal with him.
Hmm. <+++++> She's been arrested.
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything. <+++++> Yeah. What's Buddy-boy done for us lately?
Yes. <+++++> . or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
I don't want any trouble. <+++++> Oh, come on, just a little.
Millie, I know what I'm doing. <+++++> We should leave this town. I can't take this anymore. I'm not gonna let him kill you in my house.
Leo spanked a waitress? <+++++> Apparently, way it went, he invited her to come to Santa Anita to play the ponies with him.
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell. <+++++> You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
Soon as they break that piÃ±ata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts. <+++++> I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
Baseball? <+++++> Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
Has not, Doctor -- and now, because of what we are planning... will not... <+++++> There is no alternative.
Whoever you are, don't call again. <+++++> Don't hang up ...
You got it in a bar? <+++++> No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?
Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire. <+++++> Rules are rules.
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8. <+++++> What do you add up to here?
Did he rob it? <+++++> Cute. He was inside for about 20 minutes. The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck. They were scoping it out, right? !
I see. What do you think our alternatives are? <+++++> We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
How'd you know that? Kay? <+++++> Cause I think we're looking at it.
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that. <+++++> Thank you.
I'll think about it. <+++++> Yes!
So you're saying...What are you saying? ? <+++++> 
At the Ezekiel Walters hearing. I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference. You were there. That's the first time I saw you. <+++++> Love at first sight?
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson? <+++++> Who's he?
How did you get in here? And what do you want? <+++++> We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
The theatres are all closed by the plague! <+++++> Oh, that.
No. <+++++> Then it's not your problem.
How you doin? <+++++> M'I gonna see you tonight?
I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai. <+++++> At least tell them I'm trying! Tell 'em something--!
Will it change my life? <+++++> Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different. <+++++> Marg! You got orders!
There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin! <+++++> Oh God...
I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them? <+++++> Who knows?
This song's for Peggy. And all you others out there a little down on your luck. <+++++> My name's, Penny! But who cares?
Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory? <+++++> Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
Yeah, I don't want her in there more than a few more minutes. <+++++> No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know.
So cut both. <+++++> One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
And this is what you wantÂthirty- nine dollars and sixty cents? <+++++> Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in-- <+++++> The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you -- <+++++> Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy.
Twelve months in oak. <+++++> On a Sauvignon Blanc?
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?] <+++++> [No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
You're saying life will take care of Diego? <+++++> Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you. It is the teacher.
Alive? <+++++> Unknown. But, it looks like all of them. Over at the processing station...sublevel 'C' under the south tower.
Don't throw that out. <+++++> Right.
Now I have jurisdiction! I said get your weapons. <+++++> These are highly trained agents overreacting without just cause.
Is that right? <+++++> I don't like starlings.
T.J., what're you doing? <+++++> My first undercover assignment. I gotta look good, right?
I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right? <+++++> Yeah, sure. Of course.
Transfer. <+++++> The eight billion. From them to us.
 <+++++> Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant? For I was not there alone.
If you're as impressed to see me as I am to see you, you're very impressed indeed. How's Jerry feeling this morning? <+++++> Fine. What the hell is going on?
Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house. <+++++> Oh... yes, of course! Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
What is that thing? <+++++> I think that thing is Ben.
Is this some kind of mugging? Because... <+++++> Shut up! WhereÂs your wallet?
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian? <+++++> Are you breaking the contract?
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India. <+++++> I brought it to you in the hospital.
He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God! DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt! <+++++> Alright, calm down. I'm going to radio in for backup right now.
Fuck her yet? <+++++> I'm working on it.
You're serious, aren't you? <+++++> What's that supposed to mean?
That something I shouldn't see? <+++++> No. But it's mine and I didn't want anyone foolin' with it.
I don't know... <+++++> Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird... <+++++> Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where. <+++++> Do that.
Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy. You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have. <+++++> Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up. I was going through your file here, and I ran into these medical records.
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something <+++++> This is your dream girl, is it?
Shields, Mr. Chekov. <+++++> Shields, aye.
Congratulations, Dick. <+++++> How am I going to break this to Bob Hope?
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me. <+++++> Did you miss me?
Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops! <+++++> Somebody told you.
So what's wrong? <+++++> Nothing wrong.
Hi... Busy? <+++++> Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
Here. <+++++> Well, stop hiding and stand up. I can't talk to you if I don't see you.
Morning after? <+++++> After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound.
No. <+++++> Too bad.
I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest. <+++++> The hell you are.
I like you, Baron. <+++++> I'm crazy about you. By the way, your pin.
You try calling the police? <+++++> What good is that? They couldn't stop him. And it'd just make him mad. They don't know him.
Never mind. Not for you to worry. <+++++> I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
Game's over, Eddie. <+++++> Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
...We stood there and I kissed her for the last time. And she said, "If lose me, you'll know that I loved you -- <+++++> Scottie --
What is it, Paul. <+++++> Stay with the children.
I don't know. Do whatever you want. <+++++> He's great, right. Is he great?
I... <+++++> How long ago was it?
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to... <+++++> ...Later.
Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's house... yeah, I was out doing this thing. <+++++> Where's that?
Alone? <+++++> Of course.
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore! <+++++> All right. Be careful.
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend. <+++++> I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
<u>Wonderful</u> scr... <+++++> Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
Shut the fuck up. Hello? <+++++> Yeah?
A single. Just for myself, please. <+++++> Will you sign the register, please?
Domini? <+++++> Yes.
Slow down, huh? <+++++> Yeah, that's what I'd recommend. You know how it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty pace.
That, and the fun of it. <+++++> I thought you had to be back to the hotel. To leave my--my note.
You want the melon? <+++++> Nah.
They didn't fire her? <+++++> No. They didn't fire her.
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful. <+++++> Who tells you these things?
Dead. <+++++> Oh.
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there. <+++++> What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
I'm sure you will. <+++++> Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
I know. <+++++> Then why have you come?
Slut. <+++++> Kiss me on the lips.
You ever held another job before? <+++++> I used to throw trash for the City.
Then ask the butler - or someone. <+++++> Let's wait awhile Janet. We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
And you let her get away. <+++++> Sir, with all due respect....
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom. <+++++> Do you know how important this is? This is big time. I'm going to read it for you, doctor.
Don't I know you... <+++++> You just might. I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.
We need to talk. <+++++> Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?
Yeah, it's mine. <+++++> Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.
Please, Anne Marie, you being here only complicates things. <+++++> I'm staying.
They don't do much of anything...! <+++++> There's a square dance at the social hall this evening.
You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland. I really don't think anyone knew about this place. <+++++> Or what she was worth.
Bob, do you remember Mary? <+++++> Who?
I-i-i-i-it's all right, fellas. Jesus, what'd you do, come by way of the Panama Canal? <+++++> Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?
Nancy. <+++++> Well, Nancy, I'm Paula... remember?
Look who's talking. <+++++> Yeah, speak for yourself.
... Whatever happened to that cute analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ... Cindy? Susan? <+++++> Cindy. Having sex with her is like reading the Wall Street Journal 'cept the Journal don't talk back.
I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared. <+++++> Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity. <+++++> Nancy's pretty good.
Lotte called me. <+++++> Oh, so the bitch escaped.
What scene? <+++++> The one where you go to the slave market. You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch. <+++++> Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
She didn't take it from you, did she? <+++++> That little girl? Ha. Now go on, get me some tools.
We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine. <+++++> Noriega is a criminal.
Who's Ryan Cooper? <+++++> I'll let the senator tell you.
What happened, Doolittle? <+++++> Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it.
Your mom knows all about The Face, okay? Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it. <+++++> Will you come and say good-night to me every night?
I get my own help. <+++++> You run the job, but I run the show. You got two weeks to set it up.
Now you're lying. <+++++> You're right. I told you I was bad at acting.
Whatever it is you're upset about. <+++++> Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
! <+++++> You seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth.
Don't use my name! <+++++> Ask the questions.
No. You ask for too much. <+++++> I ask for Justice.
Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?" <+++++> Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that... <+++++> They have... But we've both got the same problem -- lack or control. We can only keep things Miniaturized for exactly sixty minutes.
What was that? ? <+++++> Hostage negotiations.
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false. <+++++> I will if I can, Frank.
Topol. <+++++> That's right -- Topol.
Would you like to learn them? <+++++> I sure would.
What's the catch? <+++++> Ooh, I've read about this philly. She's the one who gave that wimp Batman all those migraines up in Gotham...
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake. <+++++> Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
Is that so? <+++++> Yale '21, I believe.
Damn. We can't see her for an hour? <+++++> No, she can't move for an hour.
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight. <+++++> What do you have? A Pluto call back?
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change. <+++++> With us old creeps? Come on, we have to eat.
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS. <+++++> RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
I know. <+++++> And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
I kill her - and you kill me. <+++++> Keep your voice down.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that? <+++++> When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
... Who are you? <+++++> Who do you think I am?
Yes. <+++++> Okay. Good night.
Yeah. Like the attic. Heh, heh... <+++++> Alright! That's it!
I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan ... I need plastic bags ...  tape and rope ... <+++++> Just hurry.
If you say so. You are innocent. <+++++> I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
No kidding. <+++++> Ask anybody around here.
You feel you know me. <+++++> I don't know why.
What about you? <+++++> I'm going after Dad.
I can't fly. I haven't got any wings. <+++++> You haven't got your wings. Yeah, that's right.
I've been waiting for you to get back. <+++++> You got something on the coke?
Hi... <+++++> Hi...
I'm gonna need more caps. <+++++> You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
Yes. <+++++> Yes to me or yes to the coil?
Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses! <+++++> Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river!
Burt, get out! Get up on your roof or someplace! We found out what's been killing people! They're under the ground! <+++++> What's under the ground? We're not getting up on the roof. Earth shelter's the best. Known that since I was a kid.
You lie! <+++++> Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk. <+++++> All right, all right! You've got a ship! But where do we go from here? They probably took her to find the hidden bases...
No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating. <+++++> You should try Adderall.
Who? <+++++> Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
No... I don't think so, man. <+++++> Be easy, Sailor. There's two employees.
Report. <+++++> Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.
Four <+++++> Three minutes to go!
No -- it's true. He is...really... big. <+++++> Yeah, enormous.
My name's George Kovich. Bet you've heard of me. <+++++> Don't know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin' in particular?
Epps? <+++++> Yeah.
Ash? <+++++> How'd you know my name.
How the hell did you do that? <+++++> Well, we're veering into classified info here, but I'll tell you that it involved a donor.
What are they? <+++++> Well, the public attention it would attract.
Well, I am working on my thesis. <+++++> It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
I know, I've felt it... <+++++> I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
But, buddy, you were -- <+++++> -- I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!
He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up. <+++++> Rule one: always wear make-up.
Yeah, okay. Go ahead. <+++++> Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.
Only to see. <+++++> Can't you get contacts?
No. <+++++> She got all right?
And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell. <+++++> Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo... <+++++> Thrr...
Mustn't do that, sir. <+++++> I must grant him his last rites.
Why? You're the innocent one. <+++++> Guess I'm too confused to think.
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser. <+++++> Where is Mrs. Brown?
 <+++++> And so I am.
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here. <+++++> I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
I gave you? <+++++> I'm leaving it here. Come get it and keep moving.
Let's get inside. <+++++> First enormous brick warehouse on your right.
They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery. <+++++> Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever. No one knows.
That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to. <+++++> Why us?
Have you ever heard of the Live Oak River? <+++++> No -
Do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we'll come back and shoot the scene? <+++++> BULLSHIT! I am ready now! Roll the camera! !
What wockers? <+++++> The wockers with the knockers.
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is? <+++++> The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.
Tension. It'll go. <+++++> Poor baby. This'll relax you.
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late - <+++++> They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
I see. <+++++> Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
He's trading his girl for the money. All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind. <+++++> So you took the rest of the night off...
She already hates me. You've seen to that. <+++++> You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town... <+++++> Okay, okay, okay, gimme this shit. Fine.
Something wrong? <+++++> You know Overman?
Learn anything? <+++++> Oh yeah.
Let's continue. <+++++> You had one guy "like that?"
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody. <+++++> It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
It was some guy called Brian. <+++++> Did he sound upset?
I write for you sometimes. <+++++> Not because you have to.
You went for it. <+++++> In the abstract...
I understand, Kate. What do you think of this garter? <+++++> I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect? Well, guess what?...
What was prison like? <+++++> You don't really --
I loved him! <+++++> He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
Why is this Kid staring at me? <+++++> I'm not sure.
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells. <+++++> What would you call them then?
Well...no, not really -- <+++++> You and he are not doing things?
Want to what? <+++++> Kiss me.
Why is she bringing that bag? <+++++> She's going to cook something for us?
Now you're making sense. <+++++> Right. I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope. <+++++> No... She's fine. Back home.
On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it. <+++++> Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years. <+++++> Continue.
I've seen worse. <+++++> Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware specialist. LETAC surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building.
 <+++++> I'm so tired -- DR. DREYFUSS Here -- drink this.
It is fish. <+++++> I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
Not really - <+++++> There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
You can't go. Call them back. <+++++> Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
You've made your point. <+++++> Good. Cause we just got some new info and I don't need you getting freaky on me.
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen. <+++++> William, that is just another facet of my delusions.
Look at the stars. <+++++> Yes. They're old friends.
I dunno about this...  What will my mother think? <+++++> She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE? <+++++> Those are my breasts.
What's all them books? <+++++> Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances. <+++++> Thanks, Dad.
No, no... It was very... er, nice. <+++++> Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY, totally, genuinely honest with me. Did you really, truly, honestly like it?
Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days. <+++++> Amen to that. It's been a crazy day, hasn't it? !
It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs -- <+++++> Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you? Is my nose bleeding?
I like your hair. And that suit. <+++++> I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
We're scattering the fucking ashes! <+++++> Walter--
Aye, I do, Peter. <+++++> Good.
My angel! <+++++> I'm scared!
They did a pretty good job. <+++++> Who did?
What? <+++++> I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow.
That COULD BE TOLD. <+++++> Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
They won't listen. <+++++> You think Sandmen will? There's no other way for me,
'Less the place really is haunted. <+++++> Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
About a year ago. <+++++> He dropped Jimmy off first?
A superhero's job is to protect society. Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke. <+++++> 
Are you all right with this? You think this is funny? <+++++> Yes.
Well...flashlight? <+++++> I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
I assume somebody up there has made sure no distress signal can be sent. <+++++> I'd say that's a pretty good assumption.
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates... <+++++> What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to? <+++++> DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
Please take us to the beach where we landed. <+++++> I'm sorry, I can't do that. I don't have the time. Goodbye
She is always Aphrodite. <+++++> Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
Yeah, the time went by so fast. <+++++> It did.
Not that. I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy. Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile. <+++++> Now don't go overboard, I look incredibly hot, right?
Yes. <+++++> Is this where you live?
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression. <+++++> Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
I don't understand. <+++++> I told you, time has no meaning here. If you leave, you can go anywhere, any time.
Yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within -- <+++++> There's no other way. Tie my safety line to the sub.
Oh, Tangerine. <+++++> Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
Damned clever if you ask me... <+++++> Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
No thanks, Mum. It'll pass in a minute...  ... What have you done with all my own personal things? <+++++> Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.
Which leads us to the mysterious, lost file. <+++++> They sabotaged me.
Hurry! <+++++> Faster! Don't we have another gun?
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it? <+++++> No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper. <+++++> You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner. <+++++> What's going on?
Thank you, Colonel. <+++++> Captain.
A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes. At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right. <+++++> The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just -- <+++++> Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
It's working. <+++++> 
Hey... Sheila. <+++++> What's the BITCH'S name? !
You tell me. I'm new in town. <+++++> He doesn't have the desire somehow. Our killer seems to have more purpose. More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
Can the Professor repair his own mind? <+++++> I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
...I'd really have to show it to you. <+++++> All right...
Called him. We set an ap... <+++++> Don't do this.
Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child. <+++++> We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall! <+++++> What doors?
Glad of it. <+++++> On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson.
No, actually, you were not. Every word you spoke had truth in it. <+++++> What has happened?
What's wrong, Stephen? C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind. How's Brian doing? <+++++> He's out.
Gone. <+++++> What?
Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity. <+++++> And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers, you got that! ! <+++++> Alright, alright! We were just fucking with him..you know?
You peeked, didn't you? <+++++> I peeked.
Worked, didn't it? <+++++> You tryin' to get yourself killed?
If you ask me... I'll say, "yes." <+++++> There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...
Yeah. <+++++> Let me have ten bucks?
Kojak here is arresting me for unpaid parking tickets. <+++++> 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir.
You were in the movies, right? A stuntman? What's he ever done he can talk about? You feel okay? <+++++> Not too bad.
Forget it. <+++++> Fork ah did?
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room! <+++++> Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke. <+++++> Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss. <+++++> And then I can go home?
Was that doctored-up, too? <+++++> No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now.
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see. <+++++> What is?
 <+++++> Good night.
College! <+++++> They were in the same creative writing class.
You beat him. <+++++> I got lucky.
Yes... <+++++> You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
It's a country-rock ballad. Everybody'd go home. <+++++> Nevermind. Any five. So four more.
That's too scary. <+++++> When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop. <+++++> Still...
Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt- <+++++> Now don't get carried away-
This is not going well. <+++++> Hurry! Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there? <+++++> It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
What noise? <+++++> It's like...
So he bought this Peugeot sedan at a greatly reduced price while he was there in charge of the White House Advance Team. <+++++> How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
I'm thinking about getting out of town this week. You want to come with me? <+++++> Where are you going?
I know! <+++++> Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly. <+++++> What for?
Oh dear, are you actually laughing? <+++++> No.
It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine! <+++++> Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly! <+++++> It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
That they are. <+++++> They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
Sparkling rocks? <+++++> Little ones.
You serve martinis, doncha? <+++++> Yeah...
We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads. <+++++> Oh. Okay.
Probably not too many men fit that bill. <+++++> Just give me a straight answer, Walter, cause the irony goes right over my head.
Investigators Halloran and Goetz. I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog. <+++++> I'm okay. I really kind of enjoyed it.
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty? <+++++> I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird. <+++++> Don't call me that.
I do have a tendency to use that word too much. <+++++> I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people.
All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around. <+++++> Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!
He might be. I don't know. <+++++> Hmmmm. He'll be in the Zen Room.
 <+++++> I...
It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished -- <+++++> Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.
Yes. <+++++> Why?
How was your game? <+++++> Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there. <+++++> I don't know if I want to go with you or not.
What happened to the power? <+++++> I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in.
Explosive decompression. <+++++> Decompression wouldn't do that.
What do you mean? <+++++> I mean is it... is it...?
No. <+++++> 'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up.
You know all that Âif these walls could talkÂ stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory? <+++++> Actually, I do.
And now, drum roll please... <+++++> Hope youÂre ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money. That must have made you pretty angry? <+++++> Yes.
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land. <+++++> Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here.
Yes, sir. So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir. <+++++> Not so fast! Not....
Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here. <+++++> She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
What do you want? <+++++> Keep your voice down. I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
Carter...here comes the rich white man. <+++++> Wait here. I'll handle this.
Thank you. <+++++> Yes, I've seen it before.
Dana, are you listening to me? <+++++> Yeah, Dad.
That's all you care about. You don't care about me at all. <+++++> Yes, I - yes, I do.
...moron. <+++++> Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'.
What? <+++++> She's dead.
No shit. <+++++> What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>? !
We might as well pack. <+++++> Good idea.
So, what do you think? <+++++> Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
No. <+++++> Maybe there's some private reason between you and me which will make you -- some long lost friend of ours.
You killed them, huh? Both of them? <+++++> Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Looks like a spore. Fungus of some kind, maybe? <+++++> Bloody big if it is. Top's open.
Very well! Now that I know it, I will no longer love her. <+++++> Then you yield to me.
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman. <+++++> They were killing firemen, man. When Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's files... They were my friends, I had to do it.
It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor. <+++++> Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
Lemme take you home. <+++++> I'll get my jacket.
You think it's July of 1995? That's the future, James. Do you think you're living in the future? <+++++> No, 1995 is the past.
Honey, what is it? <+++++> Hydrophobia...
John, Mr. Powell has got something to tell you. <+++++> Well, John, the night before your father died, he told me what he did with that money.
Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or -- <+++++> You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!
Let's have a rundown on the damage, Lothar? <+++++> Everything still checks out okay.
Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says. <+++++> It'll go in.
So've I. Too much. <+++++> But this is a bad one.
Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight? <+++++> As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
I'll tell him. What is it? Is it a mine? <+++++> A bomb. At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too? <+++++> They're yours. But how are you going to finish it? Without a star there's no movie.
Leave that one lay. <+++++> They still hang women in Canada, I've heard.
But what'd she actually do? <+++++> She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.
I have a tent to myself. <+++++> People will talk.
Suzie. Then you're not her grandmother... <+++++> Raised her like she was, but no, Walter's my only child. He was a good boy, till the army took him.
He was hot, wasn't he? <+++++> If I didn't have a fiancÃ© in Chicago, I'd go for it.
What desert? <+++++> Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
That's always tough. How long were you together? <+++++> Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school.
Why, thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. <+++++> That wasn't flying! That was falling with style!
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls. <+++++> Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.
You really fucked me up, Veronica. <+++++> I thought I...you..
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back! <+++++> I understand.
Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry. <+++++> No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year. <+++++> In a word? Lucrative.
On the Bar T... looking for... them. <+++++> Oh. How long I been here?
Vada, we're trying to work here. <+++++> Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
I find it restorative, sleeping in the life-blood of so many. To feel their souls coursing about me. <+++++> What's happening? What do you want?
Who we gonna beat? <+++++> Who we gonna beat?
All the way out the front door and into your van. And if you stop screaming, I swear to God I'll blow your head off. <+++++> Got it.
I saw the show. <+++++> ... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
We didn't run out. We were coming right back. <+++++> You sure?
Keep thinking. <+++++> I have been... I think you're right.
Right now, what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel. <+++++> What else did Padiche say?
You told me what? <+++++> Screw you, Jake....
Not far from here, South Boston. <+++++> How was that?
I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we... <+++++> Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
Does the Pope shit in the woods? <+++++> Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
Okay. What'd you spot...? <+++++> Three wakes off the back of those boats. Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull?
Sheila? ! <+++++> No... I really don't want to talk about it.
What do I know about Williams? <+++++> All right, boys. Take her along. I got ways of making her talk.
But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum. <+++++> Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
You know, Nick, we can't lose. <+++++> Why's that?
Yessir, I think you and me are gonna be real good friends. Why don't you tell me about your connection. <+++++> C-connection?
That's Perry. <+++++> That's it then. Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry. Jesus.
I don't know. <+++++> Should we explore?
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em. <+++++> It is too late for you to start thinking John. It is a possibility and that is good enough for me.
Packs an emotional wallop. <+++++> What else?
What made you think that? <+++++> Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus. And suddenly, I wasn't sure.
What is that? <+++++> Real man' drink.
Goodnight, Jeff. <+++++> Goodnight, Miss Paine.
", "Did you have a nice day?" before I can say anything. Pow she's out the door. <+++++> OhmyGod. Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct? <+++++> [Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
What are you doing in here? <+++++> Nothing.
...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it. <+++++> You don't have to--
We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off. <+++++> Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
I just want her to be happy. <+++++> Same alarm clock every morning, same two pops on the same snooze button...  Micheal Brenn. Yes...Yes... Hold your horses. Okay.
I don't like the word gay. <+++++> Which would you prefer?
Good morning, miss. <+++++> Thank you for waking me.
No, dear. You're at your best with a bag in front of your face. <+++++> I want to die.
Clean? <+++++> Don't blow your nose!
This pageant's like a roach motel. <+++++> Girls check in, but they don't check out.
It's mine all right. <+++++> Well, listen. I'm going to swap you my Cadillac.
What? <+++++> Where's my cat?
You're looking great, baby. <+++++> What're you doing later?
I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch. That's what all our friends think, anyway. <+++++> Okay. If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made.
I'm not a loser. <+++++> Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs.
I may have said some- thing. I don't recall. <+++++> Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
I'm afraid this meat is overdone. <+++++> I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
--Howard Hunt? <+++++> Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.
What'd ya mean? <+++++> Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return.
Go on, Major. You fascinate me. <+++++> 
Beautiful. Beautiful beaches. Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see. <+++++> Take me with you.
He's still here. <+++++> He couldn't get his car started.
Frank, don't you have something to say? <+++++> You're doing just fine.
Good evening, gentlemen. <+++++> Good evening, Captain.
Where's Spa. <+++++> Jimmy knows. 13th Street. We'll meet you there.
Here. <+++++> After all, this is a conservative firm -- I don't want people to think I'm an entertainer --
Oxygen is not the problem. <+++++> Carbon dioxide?
If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells. <+++++> There's one less tonight.
Something like that. <+++++> Oh, I know. A Fleur-de-Lis party, right?
Why? <+++++> I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now. <+++++> That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable.
It's a record of my little spot. <+++++> It's kind of overwhelming.
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean... <+++++> Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
He has his uses too. <+++++> What? He gonna record you on his label?
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here! <+++++> Look; okay, come on. Look, what are you doing? Look, that's enough. My wife called the police. They're coming.
Or we'll go somewhere. If you have the time. <+++++> If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento...
Huh? <+++++> It'll be all right. We're old friends!
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object. <+++++> There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan.
It's by the far wall. A small wave band. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. But I don't see the point. <+++++> You're wasting your time, there's no one out there.
Coffee? <+++++> ...Yes, thank you.
Why doesn't he just mix and match? <+++++> I told him that and he yelled at me.
Huh? <+++++> How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
Well, I've got my alibi. I was at the Public Library. Where were you? <+++++> Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me? <+++++> Not really, no.
You listening to me? <+++++> Yes! I'm trying, I swear!
Your favourite dish. <+++++> Excellent.
You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel. <+++++> 
Two maze runners. <+++++> Someone sends the kid a copy of the access program, then runs the maze at the same time the kid does, using the same codes.
If the ship goes, so does Jaso. <+++++> Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
Carrie. <+++++> I don't want to talk about it.
Why'd you come out here? <+++++> Why'd you take the boat?
"Straw God" changed my life. <+++++> You saw that?
You WILL go out there. <+++++> I won't and nothing you say-
The problem was to find out the frequency. Problems, problems, I've had so many... <+++++> They'll soon be over.
Um, yeah sure, I guess. <+++++> You sure do a lot of guessing.
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily. <+++++> It's a pleasure to meet you.
? <+++++> We are the choices we've made, Robert.
I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock. <+++++> Shylock?
Please don't scream at me. I like you, but I don't like the way your attitude is. <+++++> So get the fuck outta here.
I'll pull somebody out of Japan. <+++++> Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town. Get me L. B. Jefferies.
Oh, five years, give or take. <+++++> Hmm... you two in high school together?
Not if you're more hungry than scared. <+++++> All right. You win. Let's forget it.
I'm not! <+++++> Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
Shut up! <+++++> OK. Say what it is.
Think about it. <+++++> No.
In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother. <+++++> It's silly of me to argue about it. I don't know the people involved.
It's complicated for Jackie. It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand -- <+++++> Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor. <+++++> What?
You're crazy. <+++++> How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it. <+++++> Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane. He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.
I told you. <+++++> You tell me again.
What the hell was that! What did you think? Did you think it was loaded! <+++++> You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner. <+++++> I wish I were stronger. Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
He needed money? For the operation for you? <+++++> It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.
All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me. <+++++> Is that what you think?
It's the last one. <+++++> Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all. <+++++> Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age.
Just <u>hold it</u>, <u>hold it</u>! Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission? <+++++> Yes. There are two points of salient interest. Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.
What are they? <+++++> The recent past.
What are you going to do now? Call the police? Take him away? I must warn you heÂs terrified of men, so... <+++++> Shut up!
I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how they do. <+++++> Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.
What mission? <+++++> To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger.
Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man? <+++++> No, sir.
I'd like to talk to you about something. <+++++> Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute.
Thank you. <+++++> I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
That's no business... that's a social injustice. <+++++> That depends on the tip.
How many lovers have you had-- permanently? <+++++> I don't recall.
"Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge? <+++++> ..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
I can't go the way I came. <+++++> No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
It was him, man! <+++++> You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
Two-hundred dollars. <+++++> Two-hundred dollars . . . that's how I put a price on murder.
They'll make it. <+++++> Close the fucking door!
Want to tell me what happened? <+++++> 
Did you decide on a runway yet? <+++++> Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
Where the hell are you going? <+++++> Provisions! We are not leaving that motel room again till after New Year's: we need ten days worth of provisions! What's good? !
Why do you fret about something that isn't there? <+++++> Don't say that -- I know it is --
What's that? <+++++> It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
Hauser, you're lost your mind. <+++++> I didn't lose it. Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else. Me.
You okay? <+++++> Just fine. What's the weather like?
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit. <+++++> What happened to Sway?
Oh, yes. He's found Peace. <+++++> Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
WILL YOU STAY? <+++++> WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
I don't want to go to jail for this. <+++++> Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
That's really what you want. You become furious when people won't make you dead. <+++++> I'm teaching my son to be a man.
What are you doing in here? <+++++> The Elders, mon...
I don't know. She's really been stressing out. <+++++> Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
Air bubbles!... Doctor -- <+++++> No danger of an embolism. At our reduced scale, they're much too minute to prove fatal to Benes.
Look at his face, he did the deed. <+++++> You're an inspiration Lloyd; you should go on the seven hundred club or something.
Mind if I come in? <+++++> Of course not.
If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason... <+++++> Perhaps he will listen to you...
Now you will read this into the tape recorder. <+++++> 'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon.
I tried to pay you off. <+++++> Was that Swann's idea?
Second pint. <+++++> Duke...
He goes out with girls. <+++++> Well, I'll be darned. And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
So what are you up to now? <+++++> I'm robbing this place.
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking. <+++++> Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
I'm sorry. Really... I am. <+++++> Well, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it.
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is-- <+++++> Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
Don't know what you're talking about. <+++++> Of course you do.
From now on, no more pizza! Get it? Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being! <+++++> No!
My God... <+++++> He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us.
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really... <+++++> You know damn well it's more than that now! How can we stop him?
I heard what happened. It looks like somebody murdered him. <+++++> I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend. Say hello to the kids. They've grown. <+++++> I hate your kids, Frank.
What's going on? <+++++> The front door slammed. Someone went out. There's a different car starting.
Come on. I'll walk you back to the elevator. <+++++> I'm not giving up.
 <+++++> Whooee!
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya? <+++++> Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying?
Annabelle...wake up honey... <+++++> Mom? What's wrong?
Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles. You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you. <+++++> But I thought-
We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone. <+++++> Maybe we can get a throw phone in there.
What kind of test? <+++++> Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance... <+++++> I better go check on them.
You get fifteen percent. <+++++> I got partners.
I know, I know. <+++++> You've been through worse.
Bomb? <+++++> Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
The furniture guy? <+++++> What's to keep them from prying open the door?
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto. <+++++> You got a real big mouth, convict.
You just ripped my card in two! <+++++> Yes.
Shall I alert Dr. McCoy? <+++++> Yes. He has a long journey ahead.
The Idiot? <+++++> If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
Okay. <+++++> You and me.
Not that I'm in contact with. <+++++> Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
Fastball. <+++++> Why's he always call me "Meat"? I'm the guy driving a Porsche.
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about. <+++++> Isn't this a wonderful piece, class? This definitely falls into that higher category of art I was speaking of earlier.
...that it has been vouchsafed to him. <+++++> That's that's that's that's beautiful...
Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible. A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet. No offense. <+++++> None taken... but ... do we get to come back? Others of my kind, I mean.
Well -- what are we going to do? <+++++> We can still use my butter money.
I'm not everybody. <+++++> That's what everybody says.
Gorgeous. <+++++> A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.
You think it's smart to tell him we're French? <+++++> I think he's already figured that out.
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful. <+++++> They're none of them right.
No license, no prints, no warrants. Nothing. You want me to go in with you? <+++++> No, thank you.
All the more reason! I don't want you - with all due respect, Jerry - I don't want you mucking this up. <+++++> The heck d'ya mean?
I don't have a drug problem. <+++++> Neither does Joe.
Why am I Mr. Pink? <+++++> Cause you're a faggot, alright?
Everybody love Linda. <+++++> That's right. That's exactly what I mean!
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but... <+++++> Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who...
I'm sure everyone's doing their best. <+++++> Yeah.
When? <+++++> You want to go back in?
If I had known -- <+++++> -- then we never would have met.
I've been calling and calling. <+++++> I got caught up at work.
Must have taken a hell of a long time. <+++++> Time I had lots of.
-- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation. <+++++> I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
I'm sorry, George. <+++++> Yeah, well, what are you gonna do? You and me, Pablo? Are we good?
Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally? You might learn something. Now I got-- <+++++> And please don't call her my mother.
New Yorkers. <+++++> Yes. I hope you won't take this the wrong way but is there someone older I could talk to? An elder or patriarch of some kind?
I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all. <+++++> Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick. <+++++> You did?
You called Caitlin again? <+++++> She called me.
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious. <+++++> Well I don't have that skill and if I had to guess I would say that in no way did she believe me.
Shut up, dill-hole. <+++++> Butt-dumpling...
Get out of here! <+++++> What are my orders, sir?
Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy. You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh? <+++++> I'm sorry. But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.
There's no excuse for pain like that. <+++++> Sophia! I'm not even pregnant!
Only a pig could do a thing like that. <+++++> Watch your tongue, boy.
It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do! Gimme your shield. <+++++> But Chief? Over this? ?
 <+++++> But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
You wimp. I had a lot riding on this. They bought you... more like least rented you cheap-- <+++++> I'm switching off now.
How did it go? <+++++> Fine.
You know something. <+++++> About running, dying what?
Okay, okay. I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to? <+++++> How I make my living, what's your point?
Tear it apart? <+++++> Yes.
What? <+++++> Once you been up there, you know you been some place!
I'm doing that too. <+++++> I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
Your mom made that all by herself. <+++++> No kidding!
I've already got more help than I need. <+++++> I think you need more help than you've got.
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL <+++++> Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted. I thought DeJesus fixed that? <+++++> He did.
I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out. <+++++> Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.
What? <+++++> You know how to drive a stick?
I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here? <+++++> Yes. No.
Coffee's perked. <+++++> When did she die?
Everything's going wrong. I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before. I can't get him to respond. <+++++> How come?
It was him. <+++++> You can't go in there.
I was? <+++++> That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
Exactly, yes, Mr. President. That is my contention. <+++++> 
My advice to you? Don't die. <+++++> Feeling the pressure?
Why should you care? <+++++> Why... should YOU care?
Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect. <+++++> Why's that?
We could have cut it off at the main computer... <+++++> This served the purpose.
Say something, Theo. Give me something. A doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into Sheila's eyes. <+++++> Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C. Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy hands sliding over each others' sweaty skin.
So what about you Cowboys anyway? <+++++> If I had to explain it you Wouldn't understand. Just say We're brothers to the bone.
She fucked you? <+++++> She fucked me too.
... and you come home to this. <+++++> You fucking slut! !
Just ran into a little trouble. <+++++> Another accident? You've really got to be more careful. Can I get you a drink?
Back. Neck. Back. <+++++> What?
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to? <+++++> You know I would. Whatever you want.
So tell me about it. <+++++> In the morning.
That don't smell like a More. <+++++> It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
Yeah. <+++++> As in daughter of Agamemnon?
The new hero is you. <+++++> I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
How did you come by this scenario? <+++++> I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
Is that you. D? <+++++> Yes, are you okay...? !
Are you okay? What happened? <+++++> Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.
Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club. <+++++> It should, but I found it and now I claim it. carpe cavern, guys. Seize the cave.
 <+++++> What about time...?
Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you? <+++++> Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear? Now I'm curious. What does a Space Ranger actually do?
I haven't seen him. He probably came in through the south entrance. <+++++> Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!
This is ogre's magic. <+++++> Blackheart?
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman... <+++++> More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut--- <+++++> Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport.
Squid? <+++++> Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name? <+++++> You know, I... don't know.
Oh I don't think so. <+++++> Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
What exactly is wrong? <+++++> Nothing yet. I'll start experiencing symptoms in my late-fifties.
I said--shall we get started *now* or-- <+++++> Yes--sure. Why not? You don't mind if I take the time to get a pencil?
Thanks for clarifying that. <+++++> Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Faulty wiring. <+++++> Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond? I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France? <+++++> I leave the answer to God.
What? <+++++> You're it.
I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through. <+++++> Maybe plans changed...
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old. <+++++> I think she has to find out for herself, on her own. We have to allow her space --
Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more. <+++++> They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me. <+++++> You know, I'm kind of tired. I'm just gonna go home if it's all the same to you.
That's a cow, Harry. <+++++> Well, I could go for a tall glass of polar bear milk right now.
My period. <+++++> When? Tonight?
I do. I do. In my own way. <+++++> Then what are you scared of, honey?
You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington. <+++++> Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
That J.D. kid is a little shit. <+++++> What.
Consider me ungrateful. <+++++> ItÂs I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6. So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can. <+++++> Then what? It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate... <+++++> Unfortunate that I know the truth?
I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence. <+++++> That's what you think.
You can't take anything seriously. <+++++> You're right.
Thank you. <+++++> You're welcome.
Tell her to have a nice trip. <+++++> Thanks.
That's great! See, you're getting it. <+++++> No problemo.
What? <+++++> Oh my God! Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
No one must follow your work. <+++++> Alright, yeah. You're right. We have to destroy the stuff at the lab, the files, disk drive... and everything I have here.
We have to tell Mother and Cal. <+++++> Now it's worse.
What do you have in mind? <+++++> To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
You know anything about him? <+++++> Yeh, he croaked Luther. What else do I gotta know.
You need a ride? <+++++> Got one. Just pulled up.
Well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each. <+++++> How could that be? The box was packed!
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours. <+++++> We had an off night, that's all.
If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition... <+++++> Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
"Sleepless in Seattle"? <+++++> That's what she called him on the show. Because he can't sleep.
Sure you do -- you win either way. <+++++> I'm supposed to.
We got simple tastes, you and me. <+++++> The best.
I'm asking it. <+++++> How the hell do I know <u>who</u>? Some jerk-off. Some peeping-tom prick.
But what if they serve soup? <+++++> Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
You boys been hitting the pipe? <+++++> No, Eddie. It's just that, I dunno.
...about-- <+++++> There's nothing to say, doctor.
Are you sure these are the coordinates? <+++++> Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
They've got a book for everything. <+++++> The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth. He'd lie about his favorite color.
Sentimental fellow, aren't you? <+++++> Yes and no.
Am I sure? <+++++> Are you sure?
Got him in the Foxhall. 4421 Gainsborough. <+++++> Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route. What's our confirmed time?
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's. Were you involved? <+++++> It was Bo, Sir Te's man. I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
You know that's probably not the best idea. I'll just wait to see them in the store. <+++++> Okay. Fine. Understood. I'm off then.
What? <+++++> I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
Where's my ear? Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear? <+++++> Outta my way! Here I come, here I come --
Will he live? <+++++> I don't know. This beast lost a lot of blood.
Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all. <+++++> Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
Di, we're sorry. We... <+++++> It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility.
Thank you for coming. <+++++> Hello, Quince.
Where to first? <+++++> The House of Pain.
I said okay, Jake. <+++++> Yeah, yeah. If she'd come in here saying she was Shirley Temple you'd say okay to that, too.
He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane. <+++++> Everybody just shut up!
You wish. <+++++> Cash or check, Jazz? Don't do this to me.
Give me the ball. <+++++> My court, I go first.
Yes, sir. I have him in my mind. <+++++> And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember...
My friend told me she lived around here. <+++++> Your friend must be misinformed.
No. I've put up with a lot from you guys, but now I finally have to take disciplinary action. <+++++> Christ. All of a sudden it's West Point.
I see... <+++++> And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
 <+++++> That's three things.
He can't piss standing up anymore. <+++++> He lives with his mother.
You don't have to be involved, Will. <+++++> You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I like it or not...
I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does. <+++++> Do you believe him?
You look beautiful. <+++++> Okay... Hold on...
Make it the way I always do. <+++++> Yeah. Too sweet.
Daddy! <+++++> Oh God!
Hey, hey, hey. <+++++> 
But I would never, never consider ...  His death was awful, an awful thing for this country. Do you ever think of death, Mr. Helms? <+++++> Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality. Do you appreciate flowers?
I didnÂt know any of this before you left for Los Angeles. <+++++> You donÂt say.
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it. I was up all night and... <+++++> Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
Thirty-five. <+++++> How much do you weigh?
I will start with you. <+++++> That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring? <+++++> He said you told him. It'd be safer with you.
Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's never happened before. <+++++> You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded. <+++++> Tomorrow I'll steal you another.
That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy -- <+++++> Imagine our surprise when they began to gestate. My group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists, facilitating their programs.
No gun. <+++++> Well.
It's on. <+++++> You think?
You think I scam? <+++++> You're unlucky.
I haven't had much luck with women... <+++++> Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...
Maybe I should be heroic more often. <+++++> Maybe you shouldn't. Don't get happy. This changes nothing between you and me.
Hey, good morning, Barry. <+++++> Hey...Lance....can I.....
I don't know, I haven't read much. I don't think poetry's my kinda thing? <+++++> Do you pray?
Please don't leave. I'm going to talk to you. What's your name? <+++++> Are you talking to me?
Detective Niccoletti? <+++++> What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?
You're right. I'm a little out of practice. Uh....that's an "s." <+++++> A "t."
Boys like him have -- expectations. <+++++> I have expectations, too.
You don't have... <+++++> Any holes? Nope. Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human. Born free.
Was he alive when... Caitlin... <+++++> No. I place the time of death at about three-twenty.
My lucky charm. <+++++> Feels like a cigarette lighter.
Hi. <+++++> I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant! <+++++> What are you talking about!
How much time? <+++++> Depends on the mind. But eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this.
Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody -- <+++++> You took Bill.
JOINT action? <+++++> Yes sir...We've received information about a band of Comanches under a chief named Scar...
Is Sandy part of this? <+++++> No. not at all.
He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer. <+++++> Please...
Not you, Sugar. <+++++> I'm just going to get some ice.
Thanks very much, sonny-- <+++++> I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
Is Miss Dugan well? <+++++> There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
He's in college? <+++++> And he's fine, girl.
Baseball? <+++++> I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution? <+++++> Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that. I'm not royalty.
Rough? <+++++> I'll say.
Yeah I guess...sort of. <+++++> But we wouldn't really be related right?
You mean you'll tell us his name?? ? <+++++> It's not a he, General. It was an article in the "Times" about a year and a half ago.
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up? <+++++> I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can. <+++++> I'm still here, Doc.
Did you use the alarm system since we were here last? <+++++> The first night... Not the last two.
Why not? <+++++> Cuz nothing happened at school.
Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips. <+++++> It don't matter.
Joe, give my nephew a drink. <+++++> Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing? <+++++> A bonfire, probably.
Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes. I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name. <+++++> The Fontainbleau? 20 minutes?
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner? <+++++> You mean, Leo?
I say we go. <+++++> You say we go?
October-ish. <+++++> I have a small window of time.
You just fought Sugar Ray two weeks ago and you're training like this right now... Are you afraid Sugar Ray might beat you this time? <+++++> I tell you what. You hit me here. Sugar Ray hits me here. I can't tell the difference. I just fight.
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you. <+++++> Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors.
Hmmm? <+++++> It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
Someone waiting for you? <+++++> No one's waiting.
Who cares ? <+++++> You're right. Let's never stop...
Peter Kenneth Appleton. Hollywood, California. <+++++> The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all! <+++++> Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
Or shall I call my servant? <+++++> I know your face. You're Norma Desmond. You used to be in pictures. You used to be big.
We know you were with her. <+++++> Oh shit... No...
Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups? <+++++> You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
Something like that. <+++++> And everybody you care about would be dead and buried.
It's, like, a caveman thing! <+++++> So that's a maybe?
No. <+++++> You want your money back? Try and get it in a court of law. C'mon, don't be a sorehead.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going. <+++++> Okay, if you insist. But -- you drive.
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and... <+++++> Hold it, Joe. He wants to come back to work, Chuck.
You what? <+++++> It was fifteen minutes late.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all. <+++++> Well, now you have.
"Basically". <+++++> What do you mean "basically"?
Why not me? <+++++> To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.
And the new label? And the Kinky Wizards? <+++++> Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what? Why don't I just make you a tape?
Call and tell you. <+++++> And you let them come up. You don't try to make the bust yourself. You understand?
--Jesus-- <+++++> --he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman--
Oh, now, that's a great one! <+++++> You like it?
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches. <+++++> Can you trust them?
I think we should stop talking. <+++++> Fine by me.
That was kid gloves? <+++++> Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.
I thought we all had separate rooms. <+++++> Come on, Jack. It's not like it's the first time we've bunked together. It'll be like when we were kids. Relax.
So watcha doin'? <+++++> Nothin'.
Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it? <+++++> Can't you tell me anything?
Young man -- you got me there. <+++++> 'N Daniel Webster will be there.
You rode your bike out there? <+++++> Yes, sir.
Where have they gone? <+++++> Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
Why can't we? <+++++> Not in your nature.
Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again -- <+++++> Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance.
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir. <+++++> Perhaps, Major. Perhaps. Pour me a scotch and soda, please. And help yourself to whatever you like.
Are you married? <+++++> No. Are you proposing?
What a strange fellow. <+++++> Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
I knew there was something wrong with them. <+++++> They're dead. They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.
Drugs? Cash? Both if we're lucky. <+++++> How we gonna get that lucky?
Well, I'm a little confused here. <+++++> You're a little confused?
No problem. <+++++> A star is born.
Oh no? <+++++> Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.
None of that's true? <+++++> Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer.
Christ, Amy. <+++++> Oh, shut up and be happy. ItÂs always this or that. YouÂre never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce. <+++++> Really?
What? You told me to get out of here. I thought you were here to collect me. I was so relieved. <+++++> No time to explain. You've done well, and we're so close. So close. It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.
And how come you're up so early? <+++++> Early? Is four in the morning early for you?
Huh? <+++++> Eggs?
He's not Army, it's not official -- <+++++> Then it's unofficial.
I don't know about that. <+++++> I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important. <+++++> I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so? <+++++> Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
Father... <+++++> There must be a passage to that other ocean.
That's too bad. <+++++> What do you know about the ear?. anything?
Yes? <+++++> "Well worth the dig!"
I've got a lot of thinking to do. 'Sides, the room was getting too crowded for me. <+++++> Not too much of the socializing type, then?
Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh. <+++++> Shut up, dill-hole.
Goodbye, Muffin. <+++++> No, you're the muffin.
They probably want to find out when they were made. <+++++> Right.
We'll ask Evelyn. Evelyn? Evelyn! <+++++> Ooo, she's thinking of her date! Come on, you've been dating a pilot. We want to know what we can expect.
For what? <+++++> That's gonna stay my secret.
That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown. <+++++> What's the bottom line?
Who told you to look at ElektraÂs files? <+++++> I took the initiative.

What? <+++++> Mine. Land mine!
The name is Gillis. I'm single. <+++++> Where do you live?
This isn't important? The earth is our home. <+++++> Kimberly, it's a dance. It's a stupid dance with a bunch of stupid kids that I see every stupid day.
How so? <+++++> Sure, they did stuff, but nothing like this, Bob. Forget Watergate, the break-ins, the Enemies list.
Well, who in particular? <+++++> Right now?
You use your equipment, don't you? <+++++> So?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone. We're not to let you through. <+++++> I'm going to the market.
I know that. <+++++> Well, suit yourself, then...its your decision...  Ha ha...a little joke...suit yourself...
Uh-huh... <+++++> I'm sorry... are you okay?

You're just come in -- <+++++> Calm down.
You have another house somewhere or something? <+++++> No.
You know what I mean. Your reputation. <+++++> But I have no reputation. I'm as free as the air.
: What are you up to? <+++++> Nothing.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us? <+++++> Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
Uh, ten uh... <+++++> Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it.
If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all. <+++++> But I understand you, Mom. I always have.
I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there. <+++++> Is that all?

I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson. <+++++> I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
Brewer! You know what that thing's packing? <+++++> It's a Soviet MIL MI-24. Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...
What are you doing? <+++++> Terry's name should be on this wall.
You know what's in the bag you're taking? <+++++> He say is a surprise.
Hi, Mr Crane. <+++++> Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.
Of course I do. Where are you? <+++++> At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
A million. Easy. <+++++> She was fast, huh?
Every valuable item in the house was on that list. <+++++> That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer. <+++++> Maybe I should get help.
Finally, some common sense... <+++++> What do you mean?
Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain. <+++++> Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.
S-ssstop that! <+++++> Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Good. Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills? <+++++> Sure. For five bucks.
Several possession charges, but nothing major. <+++++> Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
How can you still believe she's innocent? <+++++> You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart. I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore. <+++++> Don't be too long.
Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere. <+++++> Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
No time to explain. Just listen. When I yell "stop," you jam on the brakes as hard as you can. Okay? <+++++> You're the boss.
How was Russia? <+++++> Cold.
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case... <+++++> Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
A paper on that one too? <+++++> Yeah...but don't worry about that now. The Hemmingway one is first.
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big. <+++++> They all sound big at the talking stage.
Good coloring. <+++++> That's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.
No, no, no, no, no. <+++++> I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
If you say so. The stripe. <+++++> Good choice.
What exactly do you mean? <+++++> The message you left.
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows. <+++++> O.K. Thank you very much.
Really? <+++++> What do you mean, "really?" Yeah. Really. What about you?
I thought it was interesting -- <+++++> God damnit, Electra. This is not a game. This is business.
What did you use? <+++++> A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal. He'll sleep, that's all.
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live? <+++++> Edinburgh.
There must be a way to fix this. <+++++> Fix?
I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare. <+++++> What happened?
What is? ! <+++++> Show business.
Employed? <+++++> You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
He is the King. <+++++> Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor.
Do you like it? <+++++> It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
Engaged. <+++++> Let's take her into an escape orbit.
Madame is waiting. <+++++> For me? Okay.
I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk. <+++++> Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
Not funny, Sam! <+++++> This is not a joke. They know that we know about them. They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
Tell me when the whales are going to be released? <+++++> ... Who are you?
Fine. Fine. <+++++> Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
Well, I'm pretty impolite. Would you like some? <+++++> I don't eat vegetables.
Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R & D department came up with ... <+++++> How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
A gun? Yes. <+++++> What caliber is your gun?
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from? <+++++> ...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder. <+++++> About to pour his sulfa. Sees the wound. Stops. Knows it's fatal.
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster. <+++++> Ah, so I pull the strings!
The gentlemen that gave this to me said you'd recognize it. Said he wanted it'd be 'bout the last thing you ever saw in this life. <+++++> Oh God... OH GOD... Santos... Oh God Marietta... are you in on this?... OH GOD!! !
Marcus! <+++++> Arghhh! Oh!
If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype? <+++++> I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
How do you work it with the key? <+++++> Well, usually I slip it to them in the office and they leave it under the mat -- but never again -- I can promise you that --
It's almost over! ! <+++++> No. It's not.
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear. <+++++> He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
-- Here's a hundred dollars. And if you or anyone else will back me up on this -- <+++++> -- Forget it. And try not to bleed on my throw rugs. Why do this?
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash. <+++++> Yeah, that one.
Well, these are good signs -- she's broken up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a rapport. <+++++> I <u>know</u>.
He said that? <+++++> Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
Shouldn't pick on that. Sorry. I'm sorry about your brother.... <+++++> Yeah, well, just stop yelling.
Don't touch me. He's got... got into my head. <+++++> You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
It's disgraceful! <+++++> Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
Do they keep everything 'out' ...? <+++++> As far as touching things, yes.
Yes. We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland. <+++++> In the highlands?
Powerful warrior. <+++++> Yeah. Dinky-dau, that's me. Hey, Co.  You wanna meet Jake the one- eyed snake?
Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem? <+++++> Problem? No problem -- just want to get my money and get on home -- you know, things to see, people to do?
Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you. <+++++> I don't believe you.
You're mad. Why are you mad? <+++++> I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood.
Did you know he didn't have his shoes on? <+++++> Is that right?
I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation. <+++++> Still, I feel you should remove the decanter. Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland.
I was right! Step on it! <+++++> Let go! We've got to stop!
Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work. <+++++> Do you like the people you work with?
Tell Frick and Frack that means them too. <+++++> I'll be alright.
So let's call this the usual. <+++++> Thanks.
Really? <+++++> Yes.
The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices. <+++++> Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?
Maybe they didn't get here. Maybe they've been here. <+++++> For how long?
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb. <+++++> Please, I need my hands to work -- Christ, don't bust my thumbs.
I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what? <+++++> What?
Then what do you do? <+++++> I sleep it off.
I think I'm going to give it all up. <+++++> Give what up?
Because I'd be to blame, right? <+++++> Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour. Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
But by then, the Feds didn't need her, anyway. <+++++> But it was just mine.
He's a nigger. <+++++> Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He says, "Why you crackers always gotta find my mother fuckin' pot?
No...no. <+++++> One's enough.
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine. <+++++> I reckon so.
Yes sir. <+++++> Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side. <+++++> And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York.
Not a specific day. What's this about? <+++++> Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
Liar! You said you wouldn't leave! <+++++> I'm trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain, you know!
--I got a trip to Mars. <+++++> Oh God, Doug.
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said. <+++++> Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see, I'll get you.
So far. <+++++> What's the D.A. got them on?
Tuesday. <+++++> Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me.
Bring something to drink. <+++++> Yes. Madame.
He left us. We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead? <+++++> Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...
Anything you need. <+++++> Yo' cousin, Craig. Hook us up.
Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg ...probably a bust. <+++++> 
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age. <+++++> Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids.
Guy's involved in a "meet"... <+++++> "Buy and walk"? "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"? What?
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you. <+++++> He has thousands of employees, Milo --
Save some for tomorrow. <+++++> Catch another fish tomorrow.
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other? <+++++> And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
Yes, Ann? <+++++> And you should tell Doris...
Would somebody please pass me the catsup? <+++++> What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
We'd better get to work on the papers. <+++++> Papers...?
Ben is very ill. <+++++> 
All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy. <+++++> I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow.
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay. <+++++> I got scared.
The floor has a nice shine to it. Oh God -- we have twenty-two messages on the machine. <+++++> Did she water this plant? It looks a little bent out of shape.
I won't forget. <+++++> I seem to be forever thanking you for something, don't I?
Why? <+++++> Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
Other people? <+++++> Small talk.
Oh, thank God. <+++++> I'm still here.
Nothing to be sorry about. <+++++> Just your pappy scared some.
 <+++++> 
What guy that died? <+++++> That one, last week.
&quot;Yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot; I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms... <+++++> What's that?
Huh? <+++++> I just saw a man walk out of your room.
I like it. <+++++> Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
I'm afraid I don't understand. <+++++> I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him. <+++++> And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
He's downstairs -- somewhere. <+++++> All right, thank you. Please ask him to come here.
I'm taking over a TV network. <+++++> Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy birthday.
Excellent, senor. If you could follow me? <+++++> I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate. Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
I got there late, John. <+++++> Let's just find Coalmine. Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens Â
What bank? <+++++> The City National on San Vincente.
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport. <+++++> Let him finish, Bob.
I don't want to ruin your day. <+++++> That bad?
Then why do you stay? <+++++> Who else would hire me? Beat you to it, didn't I? Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a little welcoming gift.
And what would I have to do? <+++++> Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.
I do. <+++++> Which number do you want, George?
But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. The last twenty four hours have been really exciting! <+++++> People are dying out there. I don't think "exciting" is the word I'd choose to describe it!
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time. <+++++> Sure, but is that it for the list?
I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours. <+++++> You know that's not true.
What? <+++++> That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction".
That'll make up the difference, huh? <+++++> Huh?
No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise. <+++++> Oh, you did? I didn't know that.
I can't believe I slept. <+++++> You were tired. Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast. So what do you dream about?
I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see. <+++++> Good liquor draws a good crowd.
That's not the worst part. <+++++> What's worse than losing five million bucks?
Would you care to look--in the telescope? <+++++> Thank you, no.
CHIP! ! <+++++> God, Mom! What's the matter?
Who? <+++++> Paramount studios.
I try not to expect you. <+++++> But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
*Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'... <+++++> 'S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet.
 <+++++> Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
Go! Go! He's got her. <+++++> Suspect westbound on Olympic. Grey sedan. Has hostage, repeat...
Never mind that, I want my man! <+++++> He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her. <+++++> Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think.
'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful. <+++++> Congratulations, Gina.
I don't know. I say what I mean. <+++++> Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think? <+++++> What's to think about?
Five million? <+++++> 
I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie... <+++++> I know you do, Sidney.
21. <+++++> It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
What about that? <+++++> I tried it.
You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story? <+++++> You told it to me.
I beg your pardon? <+++++> You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
You're a sweet man, Richard. <+++++> I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
You're shaking. <+++++> It's the tension.
Masry & Vititoe, can I help you? <+++++> Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin. Brockovich. From the file room?
I have nothing more to say. <+++++> You don't mind getting on people's nerves, do you?
You know what I think? I think I'm a dead man. I'm one in the brain. That's what I think! <+++++> Caesar, what are we going to do?
They're still behind us... <+++++> We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...
God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose? <+++++> Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.
Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it! <+++++> Trip, it's not the end of the world, okay? Quit acting all squeezed out.
Skinny lunger, your guns don't Impress me. Wasn't for those guns You'd be nothin'. <+++++> Why Ed, what an ugly thing to Say! Does this mean you're not my Friend anymore?
And do you know what I'd like to have you do with that check? <+++++> What?

I can't get it until Monday. Honest. <+++++> You chickenshit punk...
I'm telling you, I saw it... <+++++> What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
I should go to the house, get breakfast. <+++++> The lamp was burning all night in his room. Caravaggio was there with him.
Hello? <+++++> Hello Sidney.

This isn't fucking funny, Dante! <+++++> I'm not fooling around! Who went back there?
Pretty low all around. <+++++> We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around.
Is that what he tells you? <+++++> He doesn't have to tell me.
I don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I'm confused... <+++++> A little family emergency --
What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama? <+++++> He warned about the future of Tibet.
Where's your wife, Henry? <+++++> Go to hell.
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks. <+++++> All right - go to it.
He must've unsealed the room! <+++++> How, he's supposed to be dead!
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be? <+++++> In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin. We never should have landed here. <+++++> Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything. The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..." <+++++> Give me some time to Blow the man down!

Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him. <+++++> Sam?

What the hell's that for? <+++++> What's it for? ?
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag? <+++++> I beg your pardon?
Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to you. You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone... <+++++> Just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is. You forgetting something?
You're totally full of shit, aren't you? <+++++> You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer. <+++++> This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew? <+++++> No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark. <+++++> Yo, hit the lights.
We got room for lots more. I say we go back. <+++++> No! It's our lives now, not theirs. And I'm in charge of this boat! Now row! !
Yes, Major. <+++++> Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit! I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
Five thou. <+++++> Chickenshit money.
I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty... <+++++> ... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
Oh God, I'm scared. <+++++> I love you, Zoe. I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you. No matter what happens.
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold? <+++++> Where are the papers?
I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter. <+++++> Would four of them -- ?
A lot that means. <+++++> Grace, tell him.
Hello Nancy. <+++++> Hi daddy. I know what happened.
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension? <+++++> And you are...?
Executive Assistant. Secretary. Girlfriend? <+++++> Had one. Didn't work.
You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back. <+++++> I have to try this case. I have to do it, Mick. I've got to stand up for that girl. I need your help.
No. <+++++> Have you seen him?
No. <+++++> Neurology?
Oh, like your life's any better? <+++++> I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there? <+++++> Yeah. But not with the Cong.
So, I didn't. He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that. <+++++> He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it. <+++++> What do you think?
What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore? <+++++> Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me. <+++++> Sounds awful. I guess we better check it out.
I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You with the hookers! <+++++> Escorts!
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious. <+++++> Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder. What are you going to do about it? <+++++> If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
What are you talking about... ? <+++++> She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
It's... it's not like that. <+++++> I see. Well. Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it-- <+++++> You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
What... huh? <+++++> Check it out.
The one about the Siberian bloodhound? <+++++> Siberian bloodhound? No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
For all the really important things-- <+++++> Right!
I know, but that's enough. <+++++> You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished. <+++++> I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me...
Pike. <+++++> You're having a fling with him?
You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars. <+++++> That's right, the little gook- pricks. But they are noble little gook-pricks, noble. Because they fight with their guts, like animals.
Have you seen him? <+++++> No.
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me? Why should that mean anything to you? <+++++> You know why. You saw it the other night at the piano. You turned away from me.
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine? <+++++> Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
Oh! <+++++> Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Now? <+++++> Just take a minute. You'll be glad you did, I bet.
Whose rooms are those? <+++++> Your mother's.
St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas. Front pew. Right leg. = Hollow. <+++++> What's that? Mason?
Hello, Daniel. <+++++> Daniel Burdon, FBI.
Where do you make the first cut? There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable? <+++++> He cut along the side of his stomach. The love handle.
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming. Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood. <+++++> How ingenious! Tell me about them.
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night? <+++++> Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
I didn't say I didn't. You assumed I didn't. <+++++> It's the same thing!
They sabotaged me. <+++++> I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.
Well, I could ... free up some time... <+++++> I'm listed.
 <+++++> Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
Quite a getup for jacking... <+++++> ...deer.
You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait. <+++++> Yeah. So?
At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which. <+++++> Hell...
Who said that? <+++++> At the end of the bar.
What if we do a mailing to Congressmen. <+++++> It'd never get through. All packages are screened, x-rayed and then hand-searched for explosives. You didn't like my "give-me-my- money" idea?
...Insulting people who were in the camps. ...What's the point? <+++++> They're liars and cowards.
That's silly. <+++++> To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxationÂa warm heartÂand a loving nature.
Why? <+++++> To sell, of course. I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.
So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher. <+++++> There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
And what? <+++++> Well...
Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I? <+++++> Your words drove Bouchon to --
I'd feel better if we had some heat. <+++++> Maybe we should bail?
This guy killed a mess of people. <+++++> Who?
About what? <+++++> It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
Who's driving her? <+++++> I don't know.
What are you writing? <+++++> Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
What's the bible for? <+++++> Comfort.
Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night? <+++++> No. I don't scare easy.
You cost me my livelihood. That on which I relied to support my children. <+++++> If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--
Oh, I'm sorry. <+++++> It's okay. It's not that hot anymore. Thanks God.
I'll kill you now. <+++++> He can't hold you Jesse. He's losing his grip - you can get out.
But I thought me and Dolores had something. <+++++> Forget her! Move on. A good lookink boy like you as you can have any girl you wish.
Sure you are. <+++++> No I'm not.
You stole from them, you lied to me. How do you think that's supposed to make me feel? <+++++> You think you know what this money is?
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track. <+++++> No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
Yes, thatÂs it...yes, we went to high school together. <+++++> You never really talked to me. I wanted to talk to you, man...
Do you have any news regarding my father's money? <+++++> 
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want? <+++++> I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun!
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter. <+++++> ...Where you want me to put it?
Roger, North Island. I am tied to the passenger vessel Chimera. And she is afloat. Repeat, she is afloat. Over. <+++++> Roger, Arctic Warrior. I say again, our records indicate the passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea. Over.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts. <+++++> Screw you!
I think it would be much better if you went away. <+++++> We shall see who remains here the longer.
How many men? <+++++> Four.
About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too. <+++++> Well...
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient. <+++++> Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
If possible -- both. <+++++> Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
No. <+++++> It could happen. This is the exact kind of place where it happens. But I don't want to scare you.
...Be back. <+++++> Thank you.
Butler, what'd I ever do to you? <+++++> You came back, Tod. You came back.
Mmmm... you smell good. <+++++> You don't.
If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him? <+++++> I just told you.
I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune. Most of it pretty dirty money. I don't care to have that known. <+++++> Larry Mitchell found out. So you killed him.
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death. Where is this place? <+++++> A forest near the Valley of Needles.
I'm not interested in Saturn. I said Mars. <+++++> Okay, you're the boss -- Mars it is.
So you had Conklin killed. I mean, if we're cutting the crap... <+++++> I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents.
In my heart, Heather's still alive. <+++++> What are you talking about? She hated you! You hated her! What are you smiling at?
He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you. <+++++> And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year. <+++++> So?
The same as you. That's the best deal you're going to get. I won't tell you you can save yourself because you can't. <+++++> Yeah I'm goin' to bring you somethin' all right. I've decided to make you a special project of mine.
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie. <+++++> Now you're lying.
Did something happen; are you alright? <+++++> Yes I'm fine. Everything is ok. It's fine. Everything is fine.
I don't know. He called somebody, then took off. <+++++> He didn't say anything?
Three years, Jesus, he's crazy as Barnes... <+++++> Well sometimes a man jes don' wanna go back. How you gonna talk to civilians man?
Short? It's ended. <+++++> Oh, terrific.
Oh, come on now - everybody -- <+++++> Did you just hear what I just heard?
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you! ! <+++++> NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
Yes ma'am, I reckon. <+++++> Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
All right, Dad. <+++++> Well, put your seatbelt on then.
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true. <+++++> No way out. No way out. What? Who?
On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy? <+++++> On my honor as your daddy...
That's my baby. <+++++> He's gonna be awright.
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me. <+++++> Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you. So what's the point?
I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right? <+++++> Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am. <+++++> Mister Sefelt?
Are you ready? <+++++> Ready as I'll ever be.
Neither are we. Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford. <+++++> Why don't we take this into my office.
Yes -- he did. <+++++> How?
You want me drunk? <+++++> I won't be that long.
That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker. <+++++> So the next step should be --
Namely? <+++++> Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer.
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that. <+++++> He left with Sophie.
I really look like shit. <+++++> You look sick. But you look... together. Mentally tough.
That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know. I thank you. <+++++> You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set.
Good. Good. We go Motel. <+++++> No. We go.
The extrovert. <+++++> She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
What? ! <+++++> I don't want to talk about this here.
Hmmm ... <+++++> Looks like rain, Steed...
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic. <+++++> The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
Why did he come back for you? <+++++> I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him.
You're General Kenobi?!? The Jedi knight! The commander of the White Legions? <+++++> I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars. But I have the memories.
The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons. <+++++> But I had no thought of harming her. It wasn't I...
Thanks... You can keep the doll. <+++++> Thanks a mill --  And I'll give you a buzz as soon as I hear from the people upstairs and we'll get this thing off the ground...
Mm-mm... Mm-mm... <+++++> Come on, gal...
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you. <+++++> How would you've done it?
How's the ice break? <+++++> Slow, but good. I got a nice safe blind spot going. C'mon.
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy. <+++++> Anthony, Red, stay with the guns! Coma, you cover the cannons! Joe, Theo, come with us!
Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you. <+++++> Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
What about the moon? <+++++> Did you see it?
Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl. <+++++> Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant.
No, man! No, no, no! <+++++> Tell her... I'll be there ...
You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music? <+++++> Carla Pestalozzi? No. Definitely not. You could have posed for the Mona= Lisa. Sophia Loren looks Swedish next to you.
D'Artagnan watches everything. We have to be lucky. <+++++> We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know! Convince me! <+++++> I don't know. Fuck off!
You know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit. <+++++> I needed to see if you were a cop.
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought... <+++++> She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
Well, I'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate. <+++++> Who is it?
Well, how far didya get? <+++++> Fat mile'n a half. Hit this red light, highway patrol pulls up alongside.
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route. What's our confirmed time? <+++++> From solar position, Trig & Image confirms it at approximately eight oh-four a.m.
What's that next to him? <+++++> His head. Someone cut it off.
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel. <+++++> Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop? <+++++> My client can't walk, your Honor.
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake. <+++++> Oh, Jesus.
Will they die? <+++++> Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!
Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest. <+++++> Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.
You do? <+++++> Yes, and...
That could ruin us. <+++++> Is that what it is? Dollars? Money? I'll pay for it. Take it out of my salary.
He's just been for a walk. <+++++> We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money? <+++++> Do you still have friends on the force?
You first. <+++++> Why don't you get off his case?
Why? ! <+++++> I mean, I know you're upset and all, but can't you just take a sedative?
The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure. <+++++> IPO's caused the rat population on this street.
Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married? <+++++> But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse.
Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think? <+++++> No. No, it don't. I can't do that. I can't let m'self.
Who's first? Anyone like a wing? <+++++> Yours, or the turkeys?
Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them. <+++++> Nothing bad can happen in a church, right?
The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf. <+++++> We don't know you're a werewolf. It might never happen again. You have to get on with your life.
Why did you stay with me? <+++++> Wanted to get to know you.
Home? <+++++> I'm fired.
How about this? <+++++> I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.
Eve and I...eloped. We're married. <+++++> No.
Nope - just came by to chat <+++++> We don't chat.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit. <+++++> I always favored the Hulk.
It could blow over tomorrow, too. <+++++> I'm still figuring: You're either real brave or real dumb.
That's okay, Unc. I can't swim, either. <+++++> Good.
ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH. <+++++> It falls to me to <u>reveal</u> to you a <u>secret</u>.
Wake up, baby. <+++++> Whu?
Amen! Amen! <+++++> She lieth in wait as for a prey. And increaseth the transgressors among men.
Where are we running? What am I missing here? <+++++> Waiter, the check. This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up -- <+++++> Shhh. You know what I hear?
And that's what he's doin'. He's goin'. Aren't you, J.D. ? <+++++> Yup. Thanks for the ride. You all take care.
You know how my tapes sell. People eat this stuff up. <+++++> I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.
...You got my E-mail? <+++++> And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
You should watch what you say. You don't know who's listening. <+++++> You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
Three days. <+++++> Three days??! !
I got out of there. I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it. <+++++> Found what?
It's down a ways. I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy. I could drive up. <+++++> That's all right. I got it.
You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view. <+++++> At least I have a point of view, you know?
We're leaving in three hours. <+++++> I need your help.
Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed. <+++++> Think about it: You knocked out that Jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. Maybe lost his whole line of clientele?
Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do. <+++++> Well what are we supposed to do?
The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like. <+++++> He's a champion after all.
They'll look for you. <+++++> I run over to Victoria. Play some golf with some people I know. Do it all the time. That's why I have a cabin cruiser.
They sure do stink. <+++++> Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late. <+++++> Now come on, you're be--, 'cause you're being angry at me.
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid? <+++++> Right. Here! c-4.
Lighten your load, sucker. You ain't the judge and executioner around here! <+++++> Who you trying to protect, mutherfucker? I'm telling you this S.O.B. could be one of them.
Just one favor. <+++++> Money? There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery. You'll probably get the baseball team.
I remember her. <+++++> She came again today. She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate. She feels you are her only hope.
But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it! <+++++> A part of what? Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.
I'm going to miss the game. <+++++> Because you buckled.
What's the matter? <+++++> Let's not get into any more trouble.
John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that-- <+++++> --jeeeeeeesus--
Now what? <+++++> History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid. They use it to make our food digestible for their systems.
What next? You leave promptly, of course. There is no question as to whose home this is-- <+++++> None.
My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight. <+++++> What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early? <+++++> Yes. How do you know?
Is anything wrong? Are you ill? <+++++> No.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account. <+++++> That's not ENTIRELY true.
What's wrong, Available? <+++++> Please... No.
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always. <+++++> I'm afraid.
Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I... <+++++> I know. No-one can. But I have to save him. Where's the other doctor? He said He'd listen. He promised.
Shut up, you zombie! <+++++> I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
Without a paper -- a journal of some kind -- you cannot unite a community. You belong to a very important profession. <+++++> Hm. And what should an "important professional" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?
You make the plate? <+++++> What plate?
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit? How fuckin' stupid are you? <+++++> Smarter than Americans. You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long. Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.
I'm going to wrap it around your throat! <+++++> An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd. <+++++> Uh-uh. No predetermined places and times to meet.
Oh, God, I forget. Yes. Yes. You go. Poor thing, you ought to get out. <+++++> Look out for her. She's tougher than you think.
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming! And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me. <+++++> Not exactly. What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes. But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
IF he was a traitor. <+++++> You would have killed his brother?
He's quiet. <+++++> He's weird.
Might not need a gesture quite so grand. What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world? <+++++> I was with the Princess.
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch. <+++++> Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
Harry called you his associate, but what does that mean? I never heard your name or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace. <+++++> It's what he said, I'm his associate.
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time. <+++++> Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
No you don't, and you know it. <+++++> If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
Yeah. I guess so. Did he say anything? Before the coma? <+++++> Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
If she calms down, I will let her in the house. <+++++> I am calm!
Nah... <+++++> Here have some of this. Won't feel a thing.
Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second. <+++++> SHIT!
The driver will... <+++++> But I speak English.
Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine - <+++++> Not a tiny little vial -
Yeah? <+++++> "Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Let me see if it changes colors on me. <+++++> ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
Ok Sarge, what's your status? <+++++> wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
Aye, ma'am. <+++++> Yes.
Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money? <+++++> No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train.
Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was. <+++++> Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell. Don't seem right, somehow!
No one knew him like I did... Excuse me. I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow. <+++++> Thanks for the information. Appreciate it.
I do not know -- and even if I did... <+++++> I know. I know-- you would not tell me. Loyalty -- it really is a concept that eludes me.
How'd you learn so much about dreams? <+++++> When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
I know. He told me. <+++++> What?! He told you? When?
When? Tonight? <+++++> I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica? <+++++> Betty.
Divorced. <+++++> No, I...
Breakfast. <+++++> Why don't you bring it out here? It's beautiful out here.
... How are the kids getting along? <+++++> Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning.
Why in the world can't you? <+++++> He hates all my race.
Yes, that's what we're looking for. <+++++> I think we should do something with strong female characters...
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows. <+++++> I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
Where are we going? <+++++> That tall, bright building. Near there.
Last year. I -- it was broken off. <+++++> Eduard wanted to marry me.
I don't want to do that, <+++++> Goodbye.
We've been tracking him for a while now -- <+++++> Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
Where are you taking me? <+++++> What?
For 27 years I have been Ship's Surgeon and later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months I'm due to stand down. <+++++> Stand...?
Lower. <+++++> The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.
Hello. <+++++> Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
"With a hack-hack here --" <+++++> "And a slash-slash there --"
So who's going to do it? <+++++> Dig the pit, I don't know.
And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over. <+++++> Sir?
Hey. <+++++> We can't push old Pete in this heat. He can't take it.
Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy. <+++++> Who -- who are you?
I'd believe him. <+++++> Why?
Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever. <+++++> And cunning.
It can't do you any HARM... <+++++> What do we have to do?
What do you mean a date? I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes. <+++++> I'm sorry, I guess I misunderstood.

I'm filing charges against that mother- <+++++> Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose.
Hey, Sal. <+++++> I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. YouÂre here for the highland flings, I bet.
What are you doing? <+++++> Flying the plane.
And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody. You can do it. You can do it. <+++++> Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay. Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead. <+++++> Who? Who is he? What is he?
You'll have to prove it. This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it. State your claim. <+++++> Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.
You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it. <+++++> You?
McKinney's the name. <+++++> Miss Marsh.
They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy. <+++++> If you spent a little more time training them--
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two! <+++++> Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
Philadelphia. Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick? <+++++> I don't know.
What the hell does that mean? <+++++> Actually... I don't know.
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout. <+++++> Thanks.
Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know? <+++++> When I'm good and ready.
The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons. <+++++> Sounds risky to me.
A hit. <+++++> You sunk my battleship.
Make a right. You can't miss it. <+++++> I'm making my turn. I see the school up ahead.
They were the ones that put us together. <+++++> Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
There's what they're waiting on! <+++++> They'll have to come right past us.
Maybe I will. <+++++> But Wynant --- ?
Tread softly? Who taught you how to roost a bar? <+++++> Carter, you don't understand. These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads. Part of the most deadly gang in China.
Hello, Hildy! <+++++> Hello, Walter. Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?
Waitin' for my wife. <+++++> Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
How long since you shot a gun at a man? Nine... ten years? <+++++> Eleven.
No. <+++++> An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor.
Oh, are you on the team? <+++++> No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, I fell off the school.

We need this guy. <+++++> We can't get rid of him?
Well that is to be expected. My father... <+++++> Your "father"?
If we split up, we can blend in and enter unnoticed. Once we're inside the hotel, we'll regroup. <+++++> Then what --
What do you mean, Fettes? <+++++> I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a dress. <+++++> Nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere.
He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad... <+++++> What kind of job... ?
Please don't hurt me? <+++++> "OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!
But even if it is too late. If your father is dead. It's not over. The door has to be closed. <+++++> Well, close the fucking door by all means. But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine. I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man. <+++++> Whoa, Jim. Maybe. But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
Oh, is it? Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired. <+++++> Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
This your place? <+++++> Yes.
Old Building and Loan pal, huh . . . <+++++> Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
George, good to see you, my brother. <+++++> What the fuck is going on? When did you get out of jail?
Who wouldn't. <+++++> Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for? Dance with me? <+++++> I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
Love was never our problem. <+++++> All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers. <+++++> All right, sir.
Hey! <+++++> Han, don't. It'll be all right.
Why? Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech? <+++++> Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school! Now speak Czech or English. And don't fool around anymore.
But he also wrote -- <+++++> 
Her dog, yes. <+++++> Actually, it was her husband's dog...
What song, dear? <+++++> The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
What? <+++++> The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house? <+++++> On the back street Â a green house
I taught you that. <+++++> I can play the piano?
Perhaps. <+++++> Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you. Please . . .
What did you think you were doing? Running to the cops. Hiding out. No, no. You're sorry now, aren't you? <+++++> I am sorry for all my sins. And yours.
Are you OK? <+++++> I got to stop that dancing in the street Âtill all hours.
You don't want to go home, do you? <+++++> Why are you doing this to me, Rod?

That's him alright. <+++++> It's go time, Billy-B.
Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant. But, that's all we got. <+++++> Maybe it's enough.
Oh, let's assume that they have. <+++++> If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
Jack Vincennes. He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir. He lives for it. That's the way to get him. <+++++> All right, Ed. Call Sergeant Vincennes.
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address? <+++++> They called and asked for it. "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know --  -- too bad? Pathetic? <+++++> Goodbye.
No. <+++++> I was in the brig. They gave me a deal. I blew up this Colonel's golf cart with an M-19.
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez. <+++++> On the contrary, Your Eminence. It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
This says "invitation only". <+++++> Of course you're invited. You're a big donor to the campaign. They love you.
Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead. <+++++> Look, thank you for this but--
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence -- <+++++> -- of what exactly? !
...you sonofabitch. Putting on George's boots. <+++++> That was a good one, Dad. That was really something. Remember that?
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job. <+++++> What about Joe?
But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like? <+++++> You bet. How much is that worth?
Boy, you must be pissed. <+++++> 
Legally, she can't take that stuff. Legally, she can't take the stuff. <+++++> No, Ace.
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit -- <+++++> I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
Singing? <+++++> Yeah, can you believe it?
Hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo. Sharks don't commit murder. They don't pick out a person.... <+++++> It picked Sean...It killed your father....
You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that. <+++++> No, no medicine!

We can't all be model citizens such as yourself. <+++++> It's all about the money, isn't it?

Its eyesight is worse than I thought. It couldn't see us. And it couldn't smell us through the glass. <+++++> It didn't want the fibers. What does that mean?
What is it if it ain't a curse? <+++++> It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
Nah, I don't do that anymore... <+++++> You used to dance...
Just say no. <+++++> I won't say, no, wait, Claudia --
You should'a brought the girl. <+++++> I brought the girl. She's outside.
What! What are you talking about? <+++++> The body of Joan Gale!
Is there shrimp on it? <+++++> Yes.
If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face. <+++++> Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we?
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening. <+++++> That's okay, Eddie, I do.
You're just stalling now. <+++++> You'd like to think that, wouldn't you? You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong.
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>... <+++++> ....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
Good. Thank you. Now that I have it on. Why are you laughing? You don't even know what that means. <+++++> No. I don't. But I always said to myself, when I die, I want to die laughing.
No. I don't think so. <+++++> You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese. <+++++> I know I hate Swiss cheese, the holes make me nervous.

You on all night? <+++++> Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning.
I killed him. When I was 15. He was my first. Nah, wishful thinking. Liver cancer. <+++++> I'm sorry.

"...unsure whether or not Enemy Action..." <+++++> No, I'm fine... I got it together....
I've sent Shemp into the future -- two minutes into the future to be exact. <+++++> The future? What are you talking about? Where's Shemp? !
Who did this to you? <+++++> You did.
Fine. While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair. She's frozen in - <+++++> Hold it. You never said anything about a wife, frozen or otherwise-

...A bat. <+++++> What?
Thank you very much. <+++++> Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far.

Except yours-yours. The goal of world domination. Well, if you put it that way, Minnie. How can I resist? <+++++> You can't, convict! You're just a shmoe! Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them.
I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca. <+++++> Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people? <+++++> My job is not to determine his guilt or innocence. That's up to the jury. My job is defend him.
And where is she? <+++++>

How long until we reach the Chunnel? <+++++> Twenty minutes.
I have a passport. I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated. <+++++> <u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
Is it a planet? <+++++> Not exactly. It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe.
Major Burns is far from satisfied. <+++++> That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here." <+++++> I don't remember that one.
Not long ago... <+++++> When exactly? A day, a week -- when?
Yero, by himself? <+++++> Maybe. Maybe with the crazy whites.
LOKI! Where did YOU come from? <+++++> Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.

Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side. <+++++> Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
What? <+++++> What are you doing?
<u>What</u>! <+++++> Two kids tried to set me on fire.
Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed. <+++++> How do we prove it?
Accidental? <+++++> Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.
You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell. <+++++> Don't count on it.
As I said. Hmm. <+++++> Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?
When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class. <+++++> Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
Will you hear "Last Post", Sir? <+++++> I listened extra careful to your "Stand To" this mornin', Boy.
Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal. <+++++> Lotta law around here. Just met the Sheriff.

Why, uh, what makes you think that I -- <+++++> Come on. I saw you on the net. Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
It's no snap to explain why I was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run... <+++++> ... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- truly.
 <+++++> Thank him for his letter, and put him in jail.
No thank you. I need to get my car back. <+++++> I also have a phone.

Tell Six we need engineers here, this pos. is crawling with traps. <+++++> They're on their way...
OUR picture? <+++++> Uh, yeah. Our picture.

Then why did you go see Mr. Koehler in the first place? <+++++> Because he called me.
No. I got here just before you did. <+++++> Somebody was in here.
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers... <+++++> I understand. Tell Doctor Crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready...
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something? <+++++> All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
Was she one of your teachers? <+++++> No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
Where are you going? <+++++> I don't know.
Mention my family once more and you're dead. <+++++> You can't kill me, Jon.
Other than, heÂs shagging your exgirlfriend? <+++++> No, thatÂs not it.
It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why. <+++++> It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us.
You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition. <+++++> And that is?
The story about stakes through the heart? <+++++> The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
A piece of pie on Sunday. <+++++> The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.

You're money. <+++++> Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for.
Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six. <+++++> That's right.
I say Freddie, what are you about? <+++++> Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down. <+++++> Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
Didn't mean to? You put your sword right through his head! <+++++> Gosh - Is he all right?
I said: I DON'T KNOW. You can't just come in here and start pokin' around -- <+++++> What's this, how did this happen?
One. <+++++> So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back. <+++++> Yah?
What's the plan? <+++++> This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue. You are phase one.
I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good. <+++++> Amazing you made it this far.

If we ... er ... <+++++> Look, it's  simple. Just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.
You've never *seen* this contract. <+++++> Never.
You haven't heard from Rashid, have you? <+++++> Not a peep.
An atomic bomb. <+++++> Professor, be serious, would you?
I'll bet. <+++++> On television, you seemed so sure of yourself. If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
Dr. Winkel? <+++++> Vinkel.
What, you've never seen one before? <+++++> In the Field Museum once.
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for. <+++++> Darling, you're wonderful.
Pardon me? <+++++> Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
Could we talk about that a little later? <+++++> Of course.
... If I may quote the twentieth century poet  - Joe Piscahpo:  You look Marvelous... <+++++> LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
Bloody well tell me who sent you. <+++++> You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full- time job. Now behave yourself.
I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while -- <+++++> -- We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles.
One of the other Sisters? <+++++> No.
Hey! I'm tryin' to help you. <+++++> I stay here. Damn it. I just needed the insulin. I'm used to it. Go on. Go on.

Where's Ebby? <+++++> Ain't he warning up?
What about me? <+++++> You get your money from your husband.
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock. <+++++> One more minute.
She also said I should throw whatever pitches you call for. <+++++> Annie's a smart lady.
I'm not going to Vegas. <+++++> Shut up -- yes you are. Now listen to Tee. We'll stop at a cash machine on the way.
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house. <+++++> If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
At a funeral. <+++++> Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life!
You love them, don't you? <+++++> Oh, gee, MisterÂyou wouldn'tÂyou ain't thinkin' aboutÂ
Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other. <+++++> I don't want to hurt CharleyÂ I don't want to hurt you...
How about family? Got any family? <+++++> No.
You need that real often? <+++++> Always hoping. Or this...

He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting. You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6. <+++++> But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there. Why not use that?
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring. <+++++> What did you study?
It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up-- <+++++> Joanna, I don't give a--

Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you'] <+++++> Yeah.
No -- I'm afraid not. <+++++> Well, how do I know who you are?
See? You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest. <+++++> But what if the play was a hit?
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties. <+++++> Okay. We'll deduct it from my salary.
Well... I'm game. <+++++> Me too.
Assume away! <+++++> Well, it's very easy. You simply raise more money than you really need.
What's the matter? <+++++> Ouch! Something's biting me.
I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it. <+++++> Make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time.

Bullshit... <+++++> Did you report it stolen?
Yes, thanks. <+++++> That's good. That's uh... good.
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain... <+++++> Why did she have to die?
Uh-huh. <+++++> C'mon in.
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it. <+++++> You designed it?
When you do have one I'd like to hear it. <+++++> May I keep the file?
What's that? <+++++> I don't know... Looks like clothes.
Catherine... <+++++> Please, I'll see you later this evening.
I want you to help me take this woman down stairs. I will give her a shot. You can take care of her till I get help. <+++++> How about me getting the help. She's quiet now, isn't she?
Like I'm responsible for all the smokers! <+++++> The ones in this town, yes! You encourage their growth, their habit.
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think. <+++++> How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
I don't hate women. <+++++> You hate women.
Time is running out. <+++++> Surrender! !
Is he in his room? <+++++> Of course he's in his room. All his "friends" are in there.
I went out last night. <+++++> Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me.
I noticed. <+++++> Do you see a toilet here you think is really me?
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here. <+++++> Absolutely, you have every right. I need you to do me a favor.
Looking for something in particular? There's not much of a selection. <+++++> I found this Chicago station before. Wait a minute... Here it is.
Maybe, maybe not. I have a feeling this guy is important somehow. <+++++> Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit! <+++++> Where's Bill?
Uh-huh. <+++++> What for?
Are you comfortable? <+++++> Yes. Are you shaking?
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad. <+++++> Tit for tat--as simple as that.
Does she know about it? She's in it! <+++++> What? ?
Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with Cherry Seven-Up. <+++++> Pussy love pink rocks.
What the fuck is going on here?! You can't install a simple goddamn double implant? ! <+++++> It's not my fault. We hit a memory cap.
This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know. <+++++> It's a lovely garden.
I'm sorry... are you okay? <+++++> Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ...
Yeah. <+++++> Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
My own name is a killing word. Will it be a healing word as well? <+++++> Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin.
Get the hell outta here! <+++++> Man, it's just, like, conversation.
What about E.M.S. recombination? <+++++> 
You use their witness. <+++++> That's right.
I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy. <+++++> Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom? <+++++> Just down the hall.
Okay. <+++++> I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks? <+++++> With identification.
I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter? <+++++> No.
Claude. <+++++> I never thought I'd ask this of anyone, Andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you?
 <+++++> Thank you.
Mister Tully. <+++++> Do you want a coffee?
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to... <+++++> "...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself. <+++++> I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
You want to keep him happy. <+++++> If he's happy... I'm happy.
That's not necessary. You're in. <+++++> Thank you.
 <+++++> Now you're talkin'!
So young, so unlined, so full of promise. So innocent. <+++++> I beg your pardon?
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal. <+++++> Well, in that case...
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together. <+++++> Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.
What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out. <+++++> What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasnÂt easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, whatÂs your business with these Spitzes? <+++++> They lost their son. Why?
You know, I believe she's actually jealous. <+++++> Valentine, listen to me ...
Where's Hap? <+++++> He's dead -- good and dead.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead? <+++++> I don't know. You tell me.
...all the luck in the world. <+++++> You do?
Yes, thank you Mr. President. <+++++> Paul, if you have one call in all the world to stop this, who would you call?
And the rest of us are truck horses? <+++++> There you go, talking like a woman!
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before. That your brother makin' the rabbit ears? <+++++> What is this, Twenty Questions?
I think you better sit down. <+++++> Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
Like your cocaine, I suppose. The "high" lasts several hours. We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor. <+++++> We? You've taken it?
No. No, no. <+++++> Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
I know. <+++++> 
Do you believe this fucking girl? <+++++> I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.
Why do you do it? I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something? <+++++> Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world. Seeing a student like you take root and bloom. It's worth everything.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan? <+++++> Could I? Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.
Huh? <+++++> No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks. Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
Nothingness without end... <+++++> Are all Jews the same?
Did I say something? <+++++> No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense.
Thousands? <+++++> Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at 'em-- Points to cages of cats.
Can you believe she fuckin' bit me? <+++++> And she got the medium.
 <+++++> Whoa.
Kan maaaaw Roy Orbison kin nah mah oh che. <+++++> ... to the tune of "Only the Lonely" by Roy Orbison.
What about these low-level flights? They're starting in what? An hour? Do you realize what you're letting yourself in for? <+++++> We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.
We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we? <+++++> Nobody ever had too much.
He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right? <+++++> Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
Go ahead. <+++++> Why do men chase women?
What? <+++++> Do you want to talk to  Zoe?
You're not married, are you? <+++++> What do you think?
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem? <+++++> She needed it.
Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it. <+++++> What do you mean?
What? <+++++> I'm with Don on this.
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car? <+++++> No. But when he's in that car...
Capra? That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian? <+++++> The clerk?
Please? What friends? <+++++> I don't have much time.
You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen. I made her a star. I cannot let her be destroyed. <+++++> You made her a star?
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too. <+++++> And he left when he found out what Sethe did? What you say casts a different light on it, I guess...I thought-
Pumpkin? What's wrong? <+++++> Nothing.
Why are you lying? <+++++> We're getting you out of here, aren't we?
What do you want? <+++++> I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? <+++++> Yes. What's he doing here?
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I... <+++++> You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT?
Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me? ! <+++++> Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it.
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian. <+++++> I'm sorry... I guessed wrong. I though you were a Han.
Oh, I'm good. I'm good. Kind of miss my knees, though. <+++++> You want some water or something?
You're getting off the grift? <+++++> That's right.
Yes I am. <+++++> Plastics.
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here. <+++++> Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
What were you dreaming about? <+++++> A voice ...
I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood. <+++++> Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic. <+++++> You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message. <+++++> It's Miles.
Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.] <+++++> I thought you were married!
Did you now? On which bounce? <+++++> - and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.
Pollux is -- what? <+++++> Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
I'm a werewolf. <+++++> A werewolf?
Look, Doctor! <+++++> Well, this explains the music.
They nail him for it bad ? <+++++> He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't give him no medals or nothing --
But that did not stop me from taking her when I saw her beauty, nor did it stop her from loving me. <+++++> How did she die?
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up. <+++++> You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fuckin' kill you.
Sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable. <+++++> If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
I need your help. <+++++> We're leaving in three hours.
He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her. <+++++> I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
You mentioned something called Redstone. <+++++> Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now... <+++++> I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
He never told me anything. Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together. <+++++> You could've come.
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice. <+++++> You look so different.
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost. <+++++> It's just carpet.
Will you sign for the bed? <+++++> Sure.
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg. <+++++> Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
Clearly. <+++++> You're rich. What do you have to worry about?
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team? <+++++> Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it.
You believe me, don't you? <+++++> What does it matter what I bel- ieve? .. What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes ..
I don't know... <+++++> I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight.
All right. Why don't you show me a cheer? <+++++> Here?
We won. <+++++> Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
At work there's always this sort of film over you. <+++++> Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth. <+++++> Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
You never answered my question. You like what you do? <+++++> Most of the time.
He's on the list. <+++++> Show me. Show me where it says Screech on the fucking list.
All of what Dewey? You do know something, don't you? <+++++> Off the record.
Because I don't think I'm crazy. <+++++> You're not crazy.
George, hallo! Today is the day, ah? Are you out? <+++++> Yeah, I'm out.
You shouldn't be here. <+++++> I want to hear this.
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here! <+++++> This interview's over! The militia stays!
It raises the metabolism, Lou. Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism? <+++++> I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
Ed Wood! You came to my party. I directed "Bride Of The Atom"! <+++++> Oh. Yeah. You.
Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there. <+++++> Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio.
What happened? <+++++> You don't remember?
This afternoon. It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part. <+++++> I have school.
What did he talk about when you guys went out? Did he say anything? <+++++> He was upset. He thought people were following him.
Then prove her wrong. <+++++> I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
Mom, have you seen Woody? <+++++> Where was the last place you left him?
 <+++++> Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
I want to be put on this case. <+++++> You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam.
Let's wait for some slow one. <+++++> Just a minute.
Here. <+++++> It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
It's... coming. <+++++> What are you talking about, it's coming? What's coming?
Way to go, Dude. If you will it, it is no dream. <+++++> You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
Yeah I'd say C...C. <+++++> Do you know...34 C? 32 C?
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy. Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>. <+++++> Vivian, I want you to listen to me.
You cut yourself outside, Miss? <+++++> Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat.
It's alright. If you want to go home... <+++++> No, I want to stay with you guys. But I can't. I mean I'm not ready.
You smell like coconuts. <+++++> It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it. <+++++> We could take the six o'clock train, Hildy. If it would save a man's life.
Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy. <+++++> I was gonna tell ya. Hey, it's just a job. I feel like shit about it.
Yes ma'am? <+++++> You are comin back, ain't ya?
Look on the bright side. If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do? <+++++> Toss us out on our ass.
What was the file name? <+++++> K-R-O-one.
I'm not pretty. <+++++> Well... not in the common way.
Maybe. <+++++> We do have a man for you.
Of course. 13 is M....MRE. <+++++> How about, MR. E.
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'? <+++++> ...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.
How curious ... <+++++> Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
Listen to me! Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you! <+++++> He's...what? Say again? We're in cell hell...
Just go to lunch. <+++++> I don't want to go to lunch.
Is anything wrong? <+++++> No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
It was the biggest I could find. <+++++> What was the real purpose behind this venture?
She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get. <+++++> Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.
This is just about money, you know that. <+++++> Quincy, please...
It is? <+++++> Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family.
Roger. <+++++> Okay. Move on.
What's the matter? <+++++> I didn't get her number.
Bullshit. <+++++> ...and a Russian grandmother...
I knew you'd make it! Where's your girl? Didn't she come? <+++++> Naw. That's over with.
He sucks soup through his front teeth. <+++++> A trademark move, don't touch it.
Lawyers? <+++++> Yeah... there's no straight lawyers in Turkey... They're all bent bent as hairpins...
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger? <+++++> I don't know, honey. I guess it would depend.
Hey. <+++++> This guy's a fat-assed Rotarian gasbag.
Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other. <+++++> I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
No way ... <+++++> No ... ?
Did you want it to come out? <+++++> No.
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application. <+++++> Not for lack of trying.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times. <+++++> I ain't mad at you...
I don't see how that plan's any better. <+++++> Someone's got to send the gold up. It can't get on the line by itself.
Do you know where we can find him? <+++++> He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb. <+++++> Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
What? <+++++> It was a condition of getting Doug out.
Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up. <+++++> Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing? <+++++> You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
That, I suppose, makes everythingÂuhÂquite all right. <+++++> Oh, this?ÂI like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me. Behold the walls of Jericho!
So we'll meet him, then? <+++++> What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want.
I predicted it. <+++++> How?
That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you. <+++++> But if you're wrong...
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine. <+++++> Would you like to talk about it?
Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train! <+++++> ...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!
No! I love sex with girls. <+++++> Oh. Okay.
High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome. Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first. Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation. <+++++> Very good. About one person in twenty just can't handle it. They go buggo.
...Got a 100 on me, you... <+++++> Not in here Dad... please. Later.
Congratulations. Who with? <+++++> A glamorous young lady way above his station...
Just back up. <+++++> I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?
No! Not the police! Don't call them! <+++++> I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
She is an innocent. <+++++> But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you. <+++++> Oh, darling! Don't let's spoil everything.
A little basic, but nice. <+++++> I'll have a file cabinet in there before tomorrow. The patient's rooms are down here.
I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice. <+++++> Oh, I had the radio on.
Trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected. <+++++> Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge.
Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas. <+++++> What's this boy got that Susie likes?
There is no problem. <+++++> So why did you idiots bring me here? ... I'm in the middle of making a picture.
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found? <+++++> A Wallet. A hotel room card. Some cash.
I'll take care of that. <+++++> It's all taken care of. It's all paid for.
Fuck your grandmother. <+++++> Yeah, I remember Mr. Alacard the shop teacher use'ta call you Little Dick Wick.
It makes all the difference. * <+++++> Why? You're never going to know. *
I don't like it, George... <+++++> Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
She said lots of thing.s <+++++> Willow!
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council. <+++++> He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own. That proves that -- <+++++> -- we are not sure of that. We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker? <+++++> Your reputation is secure, Scotty. Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too. <+++++> Uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?
It isn't... ? <+++++> We don't need him...
Wait, Crash--don't go--all I want is a date. I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'. <+++++> I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
How serious is the damage? <+++++> I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
Jack's pinned down Sarah. Should be a second. Keep dancing. <+++++> We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.
I don't mean nothin' by it. I just don't know many regular girls, that's all. <+++++> And you expect me to come over, just like that.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack? <+++++> I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
What's the question mark? <+++++> Level Ten. That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error? <+++++> Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.
A police report. <+++++> That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
Use them wooden boards to stop it all spilling into the space - We'll neaten it up later. <+++++> You sure got a handle on that word "we".
HeyÂyou're little, aren't you? <+++++> Where is the shower?
My side. <+++++> Get that doctor.
That's it, everybody out. <+++++> We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
Define illegal. <+++++> Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good. I don't like this at all... <+++++> What?
Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party? <+++++> The girl with the purple fingernails?
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am. <+++++> I know, I should be in New York covering the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew? Please, call me Gale.
No. <+++++> She's dead. Call somebody!
A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap. <+++++> If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl.
You really are a very beautiful girl. <+++++> Just a romantic, that's you.
Should I come home when I'm finished there? <+++++> We'll talk in the morning.
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he? <+++++> Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp. You tell me.
Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody. <+++++> I'm giving him his ring back.
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them. <+++++> Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
-- I pose you the same question -- <+++++> -- and who's next on your list?
Okay. That's bad. <+++++> At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
You were always such a smart little girl. <+++++> I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
Do you? <+++++> Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
What you get me. So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your "nya nya nya." <+++++> Another drink please.
Lula's gone off with Sailor. <+++++> What do you want me to do about it?
God almighty. What did you do to me? <+++++> I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit.
Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already. <+++++> Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
I don't understand, who are... ? <+++++> I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.
Tell me what happened. <+++++> What do you want to know? You saw it, you saw the loop...
Hey fuck you. <+++++> Well... I'll be speaking to your supervisor.
I'm sure they will. <+++++> As friends -- always as friends.
I was, later. <+++++> Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
Historic occasion, isn't it? <+++++> Seems like we have another one every week.
Why? <+++++> The other two will die without me.
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now. <+++++> Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
You know what I mean. <+++++> Am I afraid of them? Not during the day. Sea snakes are diurnal. When the sun's out, they don't bite.
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea... <+++++> Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
I figure the phone is off the hook, that's why I come rushing over here. <+++++> Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
Careful, Chief. I don't think you know who I am. <+++++> I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble.
Mmm, that's a good one. Maybe his echo... Okay, no more stalling. <+++++> Okay, okay... there.
Tell me ... Where is this rue de ThÃ¨bes? <+++++> Rue de ThÃ¨bes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...
Can you fix it? <+++++> No. But I can bypass it with one of these
You got it. <+++++> It's great to hear from you.
You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday. <+++++> Well, then I'm quitting.
What is he? <+++++> I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace.
I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit. <+++++> You better get used to it. That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away. <+++++> I don't care what, ain't nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size.
Where are you going? <+++++> To fetch your napkin.
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA. <+++++> Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
Does that surprise you? <+++++> Not anymore.
Can we go yet? <+++++> Go?? ?
Where'd you learn that? <+++++> What?
I can't later. <+++++> And tomorrow?
Hey Yeah? <+++++> Take me to that motel. Like you wanted.
Be careful, oh please be careful. We'll never get out of here alive, I know it. I just feel it. <+++++> You do?
Rebecca Lawson. <+++++> You wouldn't know her address, would you?
Never mind that, where are we now. <+++++> We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan. <+++++> Great word. Towel?
I was awake and he was in my room. <+++++> But, David.
They'd look silly on me. I'm fourteen years old! <+++++> How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
Against. <+++++> Too bad. PLUG HIM!
In your money, perhaps $65,000. <+++++> Do you mind if I sit down? What about the blue one?
Yes? <+++++> Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh? <+++++> Real charmer.
The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it. <+++++> How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
Hey! Oh look. <+++++> He's so tiny.
It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo. <+++++> But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
You think you've found your calling? <+++++> Maybe. Maybe. The call of the wild!
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! -- <+++++> -- you gotta give me more to go on --
The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the Bureau. <+++++> Him?
WilsonÂ yeahÂ  yeahÂ I fought Wilson. <+++++> I thought you were going to take him that night but...
I am funny. I'm real funny. <+++++> Are you in town? This sounds long distance.
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here? Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . . <+++++> Our clothes are dry.
Why don't you just call Brill directly. <+++++> I don't know who he is.
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell. <+++++> I think a skin cellÂs the more likely of the two.
No percentage in that. <+++++> They're going to arrest me.
I get them while they're young. Builds loyalty. <+++++> She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
You know what I'd like to see? Meat in a cone. You could put corned beef hash in a cone, or chopped liver. <+++++> I like it. And think of the toppings -- cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly
HOLD YOUR FIRE! <+++++> Rolls to his feet. FIRE another BURST. KILLS the last of the German riflemen. Doesn't pause. RUNS onto the field.
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before. <+++++> I have, lots of times. My mother used to clean them. I used to piss in their pools.
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from? <+++++> The South.
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em. <+++++> True?
We don't know that for sure. We'll have to wait until they move. <+++++> Well, I'm sure. You're a cop. I'm a cop. Let's do what cops do.
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked. You look frozen. What's happening? ! <+++++> You got to go back now!
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What? <+++++> I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
Ahh, there is yet time. <+++++> At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe. <+++++> I love Antigua. Maybe I'll come visit you.
Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast. <+++++> You don't seem to understand. Anne doesn't expect anything from you.
You can't be serious? <+++++> 
Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it. <+++++> Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so.
What'd Ned say? <+++++> L-lies... at first.
Where are the stockings he strangled them with? <+++++> How did you know they were stockings?
You remember how a production eats up one's life. <+++++> Oh, David. There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty. You better go, my boy. You'll be late for that aeroplane.
But now we've lost access to Craig. <+++++> My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits. <+++++> Okay, friend. You're on.
His. <+++++> Oh, well.
I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street! <+++++> Had to do what I had to do.
There must have been somebody. <+++++> I was too busy.
No nothing. <+++++> What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
Oh yeah? <+++++> Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
Oh! Come back! Don't go without me! Please come back! <+++++> I can't come back! I don't know how it works!
Cut it back a little bit. <+++++> No fucking way.
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon... <+++++> Who?
Do you want to tell me what you found? <+++++> Cash, stock certificates, and this...
Mind if I take one of your cards? In case I want to get in touch with you again. <+++++> Help yourself.
If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me. <+++++> To shoot you. Correct.
Hey, amigo, come chow with me. <+++++> No thanks, Diz.
What "magic"? <+++++> I've heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight.
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions. <+++++> That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
What are you saying? <+++++> I've robbed just as many banks as you have!
In a sense. <+++++> I don't think so. In my experience, signs are usually a lot more subtle.
Your completely missing the point. <+++++> Hey!
Bye, bye, Claudia. <+++++> Good bye.
-- just -- <+++++> -- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
For the same reason you are. <+++++> Oh, you mean the thrill!
Outstanding. <+++++> Don't think it's not going to cost you.
We've gotta take out Brynner's van before  they reach... <+++++> INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
Really? <+++++> So where is young Jonah?
So we can finally talk? <+++++> Yeah.
Who are they, sir? <+++++> They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
...yeah...good... <+++++> ...you need some old forms that she had...somebody's dying...
Is that supposed to frighten me? <+++++> You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
What did he say? <+++++> You owe me three-fifty.
Okay? <+++++> Yeah.
What do you mean? <+++++> The boxes! I TOLD you.
I wish to possess what you have now. <+++++> I want the girl. Unharmed. Now.
I know one way you can do it. <+++++> How?
Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love. <+++++> If sheep don't count.
Why? <+++++> 'Cause you're too little.
I don't remember you. <+++++> What are you talking about?
Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split. <+++++> You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story... <+++++> Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.
No one else that I know? <+++++> No.
Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell. <+++++> Should I...
Um, if you're talking to me, could you make some sense? 'Cause I don't speak Swahili. <+++++> In two more years I'll have an engineering degree.
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993. <+++++> They were the ones that put us together.
Bela, what happened? ! <+++++> I didn't feel well...
I can't believe you're doing this. I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again. <+++++> No, I'm not...
What girls you got here? <+++++> My name is Hope. This is Faith. Charity's in back.
 <+++++> Okay.
Yeah. <+++++> You'd do a good job.
You mean -- <+++++> You found the body. She was one of Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso.
I am. You're not. <+++++> But you --
Fan of a fan. You see a couple of minors come in? <+++++> Never
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot? <+++++> I just want you to meet him. Keep an open mind.
I put her to bed. <+++++> Oh. I got your cigarettes.
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it. <+++++> But a hundred men could move him.
Home, I'm done. <+++++> What about the confession?
How's your mother feeling? <+++++> Much better--thank you--
But you have no choice but to follow orders. <+++++> Now listen to me.
132, 154. <+++++> You keep that up Carmelita and one day you'll be a champion just like Mr. Skinner here. What do you think, Theo?
We can grow three primary crops in a season and, if we have some luck, we get a forth. The temperature is generally mild. <+++++> Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not. <+++++> I want to talk to you, Pierce.
God in heaven, what is that? ! <+++++> That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!
You look in his citation book? <+++++> Yah...
Then let's talk about something else... <+++++> 
...That boy damn near broke my arm. <+++++> Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
I'm going shopping. Don't try to stop me. <+++++> Cool. I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches. What do you need?
That's what I do. <+++++> Seen a lot of islands?
You're more than modest. <+++++> It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking. He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity. <+++++> Are you finished?
Fifteen thousand. <+++++> Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years.
Adam Sandler. <+++++> Funny?
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't... <+++++> No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand. Sybok also in a son of Sarek.
No! I...don't think so. I stole a car and they chased me. I hit a tree. <+++++> See -- you can drive after all!
You'd better get out of here! Kevin's coming back! <+++++> Kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, everybody's gone.
It could be anything. You're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school. <+++++> Wow just like Marco Polo.
Clean? <+++++> No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring.
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training. <+++++> I was talking to the cat.
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner? <+++++> No. No thank you.
You're pulling your hips out. <+++++> But they're nice hips. I looked up your records-- You've hit 227 home runs in the minors. That's great!
It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them. <+++++> Where were you?
With your hands or your tongue? <+++++> You're not well.
Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the money, then you're on your own. <+++++> Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
She's going to take over this class for a while. <+++++> Why
Dino... <+++++> Nobody knows anything.
It's bad. <+++++> We have to tell Mother and Cal.
Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said... <+++++> Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them. <+++++> Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know . . . I guess I was homesick.
David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder. That feels better. <+++++> Let me see it...
Hey Â it's the big A.M.. <+++++> Rene's been telling me about your work.
That's me. <+++++> Right. But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.
Don't worry... <+++++> Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
Uh huh? <+++++> Are you...gonna go...away?
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break. <+++++> Well, we won't keep you.
And how do you feel about that? <+++++> I don't wanna take over the family business.
Total, eight billion and change. <+++++> And the money goes--
All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this... <+++++> I'm out of breath! I'm a fucking fugitive!
I'll come back later, huh? <+++++> Sure. Why not?
It will. <+++++> It doesn't hurt.
No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this. <+++++> You've got a point there.
Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort? <+++++> Um, hi?
No. <+++++> Well, you should know, damn it, or who else would know? Pull over right here.
How old is Anna? <+++++> She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come...
You know the answer to every goddamn question and I knew the answer to those questions and I'm not half as smart as you are so What Happened? <+++++> I don't know.
Are we going to ever see your father? <+++++> My father.
Does it have something to do with another guy? Are you in love with him? <+++++> It's nothin' like that.
'Magic' today, huh? <+++++> Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit! <+++++> I need your help.
Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri. <+++++> Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
It's private. <+++++> You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh? <+++++> Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Where's Ricky. <+++++> I guess inside. Or he never made it. Either way, I don't give a shit. Let's get this over with.
Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me. <+++++> She's there with you? She's there with you?
--I'm sure-- <+++++> --I'm not sure, it still feels thin--
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs. <+++++> As do I.
I know. <+++++> Fine.
But you spoke to him on the phone. <+++++> He'd call every once in a while.
My life is not some deal. I... <+++++> It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
I feel cold. <+++++> This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force. A servant of evil it is. Into it you must go.
What do I know? I'm just a bartender. <+++++> Let's go, Reggie.
He went dirty and they made an example of him. <+++++> But he was such a good cop.
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify. Take this to that desk over there for further instructions. <+++++> Thank you very much.
I don't know. It wouldn't be very smart. <+++++> Listen, you're right. Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay?
What was the weapon? <+++++> .38 revolver. Never recovered.
A God damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half Mustang. You know how long it took me to find that hose? <+++++> About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
Because I got some plans - <+++++> I'm not doing anything. I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -
I told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult. <+++++> But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me. <+++++> Give me the gun.
Fergus. <+++++> Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life - -
Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country. <+++++> I can't.
ain't got a hatÂ <+++++> What?
I have more men. <+++++> I have smarter men.
I want him to at least see the sky! <+++++> --and we will--
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it! <+++++> All in good time.
Of course not. <+++++> It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right? <+++++> Right.
An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed! <+++++> Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?
What was it, so I'll know. <+++++> A little care he can ride in with an electric motor.
Okay, John, right, got it. Sorry about that. <+++++> No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment. Was that anything important?
Yeah -- <+++++> Now what was your news, Baxter?
Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight? <+++++> I just wanted to see her, that's all.
No. <+++++> Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
We got it second-hand. <+++++> All right - lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you?
Been telling you that all along, lad. <+++++> What magic have we on our side?
Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing. Seems to happen about every six weeks or so. <+++++> Six weeks?
This is your bed. You may leave your things in that cabinet. <+++++> Yes, ma'am...
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir? <+++++> No, I'm only here on leave. My regiment is at Valence.
Saddle River's in New Jersey. <+++++> Saddle River, New York!
Kyra's gone for a couple days. Figured I'd keep Mom company. <+++++> Who's this guy I always see her around?
Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting? Four million. <+++++> Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
Yeah, baby. <+++++> When can I talk to you?
Ted! What are you...? <+++++> I have to get in there. I have to stop this flight.
Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but -- <+++++> -- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce?
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend? <+++++> This one's history. Moving on...
The church. <+++++> He moves too fast.
I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids. You'd prob'ly fit right in. <+++++> Fuck you.
Eddie, which dress do you like better? <+++++> I don't know. Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
What does that mean? <+++++> I don't know. We'll find out.
Boss, let's get out of here. <+++++> No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
I've come to dinnnnnner! <+++++> Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
Ain't gonna collect your pay? <+++++> I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money... He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay.
Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu. She'll help you. Hurry! <+++++> Spare your energy. I'll be back!
Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy. <+++++> I can't he'p it, Ma. It don't make *me* giggly an' happy.
I don't know. <+++++> Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
Max? Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling... <+++++> Listen to me! Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it. <+++++> Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
Then where do we go? ! <+++++> I don't know.
I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . . see what the slow lane is like. <+++++> I'm sorry to see you go.
No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him? <+++++> Absolutely.
Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by? <+++++> Mickey, you're off the hook. You should be celebrating.
I love you, Lotte. <+++++> Maxine...
Binoculars. <+++++> Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>? <+++++> Because he believed me.
How's it going, Kam? <+++++> You're a week early.
Holy shit. <+++++> We got it. We got it.
Mineral baths - now really! <+++++> Where did you learn to kiss like that?
But do they love you? Do you love them? What about a queen to love? A son of your own? <+++++> What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
"And this too shall pass away." <+++++> Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away. <+++++> You love him, don't you?
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me. <+++++> She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
You don't get two chances with Junior. <+++++> At least I'll die smiling.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score. <+++++> Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
Awe inspiring. <+++++> Yeah, well, Your's isn't. Let me run a comb though it.
I'm not sure. <+++++> Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
But his leg! <+++++> Don't worry -- it comes off today.
And who runs it? <+++++> I already told you.
Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry! <+++++> Yeah, I got eyes. I put things together.
And you can only do it once, right? <+++++> That is correct.
Yes? <+++++> I don't know who you are.
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff? <+++++> I don't know.
Okay. <+++++> All this stuff doesn't mean anything. Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust.
Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa. But that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody. <+++++> She's a programmer?
Twenty seven hundred. <+++++> Exactly. You either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket, I don't give a fuck.
Olivier's in that, right? <+++++> Then it's on to the real thing.
Our decision. Together. <+++++> Your decision. For us.
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money? <+++++> Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
Cut it out, Tran. <+++++> Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
Hey, what did you want me to do, die? <+++++> Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something?
Maybe ya should see a doctor. <+++++> I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
This? It's from a thrift shop. <+++++> What did it cost?
It's a nice day. How about the beach? <+++++> Pass.
Then who changed it? <+++++> I don't know.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker. <+++++> I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
Come, it'll help you sleep. <+++++> Aye. But it won't let me dream.
We think she can be dissuaded. Have you had a glance at the diary? <+++++> Yes.
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please? <+++++> Leon? No. IÂm afraid he left.
I really think you're - <+++++> You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
Amazing. <+++++> Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
That's a very handsome sword you have there. <+++++> 
I can understand that -- after your -- uh -- <+++++> Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
Certainly. <+++++> Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius.
We run. You crack the pattern? <+++++> Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good.
Really? <+++++> Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory. Texas.
Oh, forgive me. Is this yours? <+++++> It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
What Job? <+++++> Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
Had a feeling it was you. <+++++> You look alike.
Please - - let's hear something from the others. Dr. Grant? I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler? <+++++> The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined! <+++++> Look, this isn't my kind of thing! I wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters!
And who is "they?" <+++++> ...they're sending me. Out to get Shot. Hounding me.... they're...
Wait! There's people down there! <+++++> There's people up here!
There is no conflict. <+++++> You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance. <+++++> I could not think of not accepting.
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for? <+++++> C'mon.
Did you have dinner, father? We have plenty. <+++++> Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.
Whattaya think you're in now? <+++++> I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
Christ, I know how it sounds. <+++++> Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
Wait a minute! <+++++> On your first time --
Very discreet. A note right out in the open like that. Next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass... <+++++> Lloyd, I want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...
Crash...I want you. <+++++> Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
We'll take a rain check. <+++++> I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to - only I don't want to.
Gray. <+++++> Earned.
What was the cover on the one that got Holden? <+++++> Industrial refuse.
No, not at all. <+++++> I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that.
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it. <+++++> Roussel? You mean Claude? You're calling Dr. Demento so he can come paint my face again? Fuck that.
We'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter. <+++++> Snow shelter. Okay. You dig. I'll have a little sit-down.
Wait... You hear that? <+++++> What?
The doctor thinks I am. But - <+++++> What?
What? <+++++> Marzipan! I think you've got marzipan in your hair. No wonder you're homesick.
You here again? <+++++> Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
Never been here before? <+++++> Must have opened while I was away at school.
How did it go? <+++++> It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set. Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script? <+++++> I don't know. A couple months. Why?
He's grubbing for money, father. <+++++> I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine. <+++++> I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
Why so coy about the word "frozen"? <+++++> Because, don't get into it ...
It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat. <+++++> I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
How's your wife? <+++++> When we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry. Now she's just hostile.
It was in the attic. It was jus sitting there gathering dust. <+++++> It's valuable. Hang onto it.
That's Paul Owen. <+++++> That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself. <+++++> There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
I want you to get out the car. You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person. <+++++> Yes, Madame.
No comment?! Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically! <+++++> Thanks. It was my idea.
 <+++++> The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office-- <+++++> Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for? <+++++> Flaws.
I'm driving. <+++++> Dude. That's my sister.
Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask. <+++++> Uh-oh...
He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly. <+++++> Who told you this?
Kind that will help you find the answers, George. <+++++> Hmmm . . .
Should probably ask him that. <+++++> If I have to ask again, Senator, I'll be asking in front of cameras.
He's coming right over. <+++++> Coming here?
If we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy their ability to operate in the Pacific for at least a year! <+++++> And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all.
Uh huh. <+++++> It looks so soft.
No! No, no, no, no! <+++++> You murdering dog!
Ha! I said "doll-hairs." Psych! But a deal's a deal, my friend. In you go. <+++++> Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
Who? Miss Dawson? <+++++> Yes, sir.
Uh... I think you scared them off. <+++++> This sucks. What are we doing here? Weren't we suppost'a go to Washington and score or something?
An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley? <+++++> Come on.
Now, it's a long drive back to Dallas tonight, and Trini and I have got an early flight tomorrow to New York ... <+++++> Dick, these boys want you to run. They're serious. They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.
Are you alright? <+++++> I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
Don't tell me -- was she killed? <+++++> Was she? Did you notice?
What is all this "Nick" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride. <+++++> She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I? <+++++> Yes.
I'd be glad to. Not now, of course -- with you alone. <+++++> Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
Mommy -- <+++++> Yes, darling.
Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you. <+++++> Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.
It's haunted just the same. <+++++> Yes, sir.
If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction? <+++++> If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.
Keep them out of my way. <+++++> Okay. You ready?
What's that? <+++++> Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut.
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted... <+++++> Yes.
I'm afraid not. <+++++> Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise.
I'm sure it's the most generous gift today. <+++++> The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand. Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts.
Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic? <+++++> No.
Will...? <+++++> What?
I knew it. I told him. <+++++> Now what?
Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute. <+++++> Oh, do you do much fishing?
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car. Who's driving? <+++++> I don't know.
I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni. <+++++> He said you lost something.
I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan. At least, I used to. <+++++> 
A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage. <+++++> A direct hit'll blow the top off this whole island! How're you gonna fuse the stuff?
Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her. <+++++> I understand, Sam, I know exactly how you feel. So I brought you a bottle of barley water.
This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop. <+++++> I agree, Baron.
Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....? <+++++> Freaks?... 'Fraid so, man. Goes with the territory.
Which reminds me. Can you make sure you give me a five? I want to frame it and put it on the wall. <+++++> It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
You're lucky, Flynne. <+++++> Funny, I don't feel lucky.
Scalene? <+++++> Okay. Make me an isosceles.
Harlin around? <+++++> He's up at the Look Out.
Don't even start. <+++++> No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig?
...men every time I've closed my eyes? But after you went away, I-- <+++++> Went away?
No. The Righteous Brothers. <+++++> Oh well. Nevermind.
I can't... not yet... <+++++> There's no hurry. Take you time.
What? <+++++> The flags of discontent. It's the only way anything ever gets changed. Don't try to follow us.
It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something. It's self-replicating...it mimics life. <+++++> Like the fractals?
Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me? <+++++> I didn't mean to make a fool of you.
George? Was he alone? <+++++> I don't think so.
We used to, every summer. <+++++> He's not here now, is he?
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep? <+++++> Yeah.
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad. <+++++> They're not here.
I don't want to die. <+++++> Makes two of us.
A massive cardiac arrest. <+++++> What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh. <+++++> You need a nickname.
<u>We</u> want her on Interstate Transportation of some firecrackers. Starling:  you've got Drumgo, you know her from before. <+++++> I know her by the Back.
Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this. <+++++> No?
He's with us... <+++++> He's with us... He's with us...
Thank you. No. Here... <+++++> I insist that you have it.
We've already been inspected. <+++++> Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.
Since grade school. <+++++> That's a long time.
This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious? <+++++> It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house. It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone. <+++++> That's not good enough.
Brynner. <+++++> Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
You're not going to any meeting without me. <+++++> My contact is extremely shy.
You think this is funny? <+++++> No. I think it's ugly.
In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building? <+++++> Yes, he might be.
Who are you? <+++++> Inspector Halloran. Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
You're nothing but a... a... <+++++> The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
'Lo, Ed. <+++++> Hello, Walter.
Forget that ... <+++++> Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?
And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me? <+++++> I don't know. I do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way.
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring. <+++++> Berry-picking.
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid. <+++++> Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
It is only me. <+++++> Katrina. Why do you follow?
What are you doing? <+++++> I'm not cheating! I'm not looking!
How do you know? <+++++> Never mind about that. You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
Martin? <+++++> I agree. This is the single most important discovery in history.
 <+++++> What is your uncle's name?
We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours. What was the dream about? <+++++> About an airport...before everything happened. It's the same dream I always have -- the only one. I'm a little kid in it.
Up front? <+++++> Half now, half later.
Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright. <+++++> I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
Don't think that way. <+++++> But they will. As sure as night follows day. They have to. I want you to find her out.
Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ... <+++++> COME BACK!! !
This is how I dress all the time. <+++++> But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
--My God. <+++++> --Do I know you?
I could have ended it tonight, but I didn't. <+++++> Why?
Yeah, but still... <+++++> I make enough money to eat and buy old records... what more do I want?
Kevin. How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out. <+++++> This is business. There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?" <+++++> 
Eh? <+++++> No. That's absolutely right.
You must be smoking. Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies? <+++++> So now I see where you're coming from.
I do not know your name. <+++++> You play games with me and you're through
You do NOT run out on your moth... <+++++> YOU'RE WORSE THAN <u>SHE</u> IS! WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, <u>TOO</u>?
What's an Associate Producer credit? <+++++> It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
Well, enough about the King. How about you? <+++++> How 'bout me what?
 <+++++> I just can't believe it.
I'm trying to slash my wrists. <+++++> You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
What? <+++++> After we're outside the kogus?
He said to follow him. <+++++> Follow him where?
Get out?! What does it say? <+++++> "Fucked me."
I could always apply there. <+++++> 
Lecter said a lot of things. <+++++> He's here, Ardelia.
No. How's Angela? How's she taking it? <+++++> Not so good.
Yes. <+++++> Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify? <+++++> ...a Mrs. Doneghy called... I told you that.
That don't make no sense! <+++++> Pete, it's a fool looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart. What the hell's that singing?
Then he has. <+++++> Course he has. That's his wife.
Yeah? What about Laura -- <+++++> That was never proved.
That settles it. I'm never leaving. <+++++> I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
So what're we gonna do? <+++++> ...What do you mean?
No way to start a partnership. <+++++> Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends.
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it. <+++++> Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
I'm sorry. Forgive me. <+++++> No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons.
How do I know you're tellin' the truth. <+++++> Don't have much choice, do ya?
Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village -- <+++++> And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?
Hello. <+++++> Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
He's coming back, Mom! He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived. <+++++> I told you this was a simple-minded play.
Come on, come on, fork up the scub. <+++++> That's it, man. That's the whole story.
That hair will have to go. <+++++> Fine.
Huh? <+++++> None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena!
Hello. Hello. <+++++> Who was it?
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes. <+++++> Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course. She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
Run it. <+++++> What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
Don't mention it. <+++++> Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why? <+++++> 'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
He just <u>appeared</u>. You have no idea how he arrived in this lake? <+++++> No. Do you?
What's furry, furry rabbit? <+++++> That's a game isn't it? Anyway... There's been some interesting developments.
Tell him I was looking for him, okay? I'm Dan. <+++++> I know. Uh...Alice.
So that's a maybe? <+++++> The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except maybe in your dreams.
A water main broke. <+++++> They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot? Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded!
What will you say? <+++++> To who?
Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny? <+++++> You have to forgive me if I don't laugh.
You'll learn. <+++++> Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
Renata tells me you're going to rent a car. <+++++> I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying. <+++++> What's up?
-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure -- <+++++> -- wit...nesses --
A G...g...g... <+++++> A Grail?
All right. Since you put it that way. <+++++> I'll pick you up at your place. I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
...Need a hand with those bags? <+++++> No, thanks, I can manage.
On what? <+++++> Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised -- <+++++> Well, the story's practically finished. I'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger.
Well, she's totally not here. <+++++> They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back.
Oh, Theo. You know I don't have an apartment. <+++++> Then let's go get you one.
Hi. She's auditioning for a television commercial. She said she's gonna be a little late. <+++++> Oh, yeah? How's she doing?
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full. <+++++> Sure. You can have it. Where's your bag? In the car?
You better dust this place, Sam. <+++++> I'll get my kit.
I think I see it pretty well. <+++++> It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
...Yer nostril? <+++++> Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
Because you have absolutely no remorse. No concept of remorse. You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ... <+++++> You're drunk!
Carson? <+++++> There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
She's saving herself for you. <+++++> Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
We cut our support. A conflict of ideologies. Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic. <+++++> I see you knew him.
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area. <+++++> That would definitely explain it.
I'm going with you. <+++++> She said alone -- suite 405. It ain't gonna take long.
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well. <+++++> Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid. I know there's a problem.
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country. <+++++> Have a look at him.
Oh? <+++++> What's his family background?
I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one! <+++++> It shall be done, your Majesty.
Do you want me to say I'm sorry? <+++++> Only if you really, truly mean it.
Hi sweetie. <+++++> Hi baby.
I come to the old lady's funeral. <+++++> I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
You're that sleepy, eh? What time do expect to get up tomorrow? <+++++> Late, very late.
I'm off. <+++++> Wish you weren't.
You're getting warmer. <+++++> Trees?
What it be Judge. Nobody got hurt, Sister Betty's safe. This was a good day... <+++++> They were empty...
Uh, hi Su-Chin. <+++++> Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
Southern light. <+++++> What?
Only she won't never let me play with it. <+++++> Ahh!
Our cemetery? <+++++> Yeah. He still tries popping up all over the place. But he can't join the party unless you call on him.
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you? <+++++> No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
It's fun. <+++++> I want to go home. I don't like it here.
That was a mistake, but I don't regret it. <+++++> The first and only time. A big mistake. I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
For Africa. <+++++> Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
Women aren't that unpredictable. <+++++> Lisa -- I can't guess what you're thinking.
Please! You're being foolish! <+++++> There's no room! And the air is lovely.
Tell me about it. <+++++> About...
That's classic. <+++++> Why... ?
He loves you very much. He just-- <+++++> I know he does.
You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out. <+++++> But I ain't out. I'm in. I'm in. Who's lying to who?
Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson. Set up an appointment at four. <+++++> Mis-ter Kramer, it's...  ...almost four now. It's the Friday before Christmas. Nobody is going to want to--
Jesus Christ, what happened to you? <+++++> I have AIDS.
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens. <+++++> You can buy new ones tomorrow.
Is there any more to it? <+++++> What do you mean?
Well then how can you say somebody else was there? <+++++> Because somebody cut her. While I watched.
For Christ's sake, they're kids. <+++++> We're not animals, but don't force us to be. Walk over.
Where'd you get this? <+++++> I stole it. From a synagogue.
He should have been in restraints. It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple. why not just cop to it? <+++++> Okay, it was bad judgment. But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen! <+++++> She is but an arriviste.
Come with me and I'll let her live. <+++++> You think I care about her? I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
What'you want, kid? <+++++> Jim looking for somebody.
Mph rm rmph! ! <+++++> Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo -- <+++++> Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
Diet coke. <+++++> Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
Not exactly according to plan. <+++++> Do we have to do everything ourselves? !
That was so weak. <+++++> Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA. You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.
What is it? <+++++> I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
Goddamn Gastro's killing me. Making me blind. Hey Billy! <+++++> Yeah.
Hello, I'm here about the ad. <+++++> Please, have a seat.
How was your plane ride? <+++++> The waitresses were very nice. My mother is slipping away.
Yes, sir. <+++++> Fine. I'll see you at the reception.
-- And then? <+++++> We started talking. In fact, we talked until four in the morning. We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.
I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy? <+++++> At Annie's house. She's all right.
How long to fix? <+++++> Hard to say. I gotta get in there and have a look. At least a couple days. Depending.
I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid. You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now! <+++++> I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
No! Why are you haunting me? <+++++> Because you need to understand. And you need... to be careful.
Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay? I get a few drinks inside me -- <+++++> We've never met.
What? <+++++> Hey Lex, you forgot to say gazundheit.
They're friends of my dad. Probably in their nineties or something. <+++++> Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh. <+++++> Did he tell you about Georgina?
What was that? <+++++> It's okay.
What are you writing in that book? <+++++> It's my bird book.
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties. <+++++> Don't distance us. From now on, let's be like sisters.
Firehouse. <+++++> Cute.
Why? <+++++> He's wanted in Japan. They want him first. Then we can have him.
You're a guest here? <+++++> I'm -- I'm with a friend.
I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening. <+++++> Why?
It's empty. If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't. You'd just be all nervous about -- <+++++> No, screw that. What you were saying before, it's absolutely right. -- I'd love to have you stay.
Love is different for different people. <+++++> I suppose so. I suppose it will be different for us, too ÂÂ when everyone knows. Then we will be just like other people.
He'll never make it. <+++++> Think positive.
Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down. <+++++> So? Be real easy.
Yep. <+++++> I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
I had nothing to do with that. <+++++> Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
 <+++++> ...what do you expect me to...
Yes? No. What? Save the patter for the tourists. <+++++> You want me to let him in?
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog -- <+++++> I saw the longing in your eye --
Oh, yeah? <+++++> And there's the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest.
Hello? <+++++> Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?
What sums? <+++++> Two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the London hotels. He didnÂt need your confession...
But I got two hundred and fifty coming. It's my share. Jimmy owes me. <+++++> Marty, please. Let me talk to him.
Morning Buddy, you look happy. <+++++> Any better and I'd be guilty.
I have to go. <+++++> Then take me with you.
You did the only decent thing. <+++++> Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here! <+++++> Oh God! What have we done?
In Beverly Hills? <+++++> Yeah.
Rinka. <+++++> Banzai.
You're part of it... <+++++> What? Connie...
It's what he said, I'm his associate. <+++++> You must bring something heavy to the deal.
Isn't it illegal to drink and drive? <+++++> That's funny. I wonder if you'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me?
From some German cathedral a million years ago: "Driving the Demons From the Mind." <+++++> I'm moved beyond words.
You are on my ground. <+++++> By God, I'll fight the lot of you
I said. I serve the Queen. <+++++> No other aspiration?
You think they'll ever find him? <+++++> I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this... <+++++> Me? I wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle...or even your uncle, Charlie...
No thanks. <+++++> Go on - you can have one!
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency. <+++++> What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
No... <+++++> Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here. <+++++> I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I-- <+++++> No, I'm sorry. No, I didn't mean that. No, I didn't mean that.
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives. <+++++> It's a little late to call Admissions.
What are you talking about? <+++++> I really did think I was still in reality. At least, until now. Beam me up, Scotty!
You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit. <+++++> Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
Sure. <+++++> He's a boy dog.
It looks that way. <+++++> You know what that would mean?
Why yes, thank you. <+++++> Hot or cold.
It worked! There they go! <+++++> LET'S DO IT!
Yeah? <+++++> The tide came in, the tide went out. I survived. That's the headline. I survived.
I think you know me better than my father. He's going to die, isn't he? <+++++> I don't believe that. He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.
...if they're wrong? ! <+++++> This isn't our goddamn game!
Yeah, it's me. <+++++> Oh God, Jeffrey. is that you? Oh God.
Confess what? <+++++> Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
Nothing so far. <+++++> What about the ballistics report?
Hear voices don't I. <+++++> Of course you do!
No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that. <+++++> I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
Now I know that's been my problem since I was a kid. But it only caught up to me last night. <+++++> You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood? <+++++> Came to get a tan.
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board. <+++++> Some people aren't the athletic type.
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist. <+++++> Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
...Forty thousand dollars! <+++++> Leave me alone!
For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>? <+++++> We've fused into a major series, Ross. This girl isn't the second victim.
Well, obviously some people can be <+++++> put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being? <+++++> No.
You can call me Ostreicher. <+++++> What's your middle name?
Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin' <+++++> God, that's what I keep you for.
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty. <+++++> I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.
What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'. <+++++> Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.

I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps. <+++++> It adds a taste of elegance for which I must confess a weakness for now and then. I call him Smedley.
Your life, and that of others! <+++++> If they agree to follow me, yes.
Oh my, this is very interesting. Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts? <+++++> Oh, of course!! There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
Who... <+++++> Ross.
I warned you, Dignan. <+++++> You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen. <+++++> What did you find?
Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em. <+++++> Really?
You understand? <+++++> Why, of course.
Yeah I saw 'em around. They worked vice. <+++++> Well don't you think that's odd?
It's not over, Brynner. <+++++> Sir, we can't just let him get away with this!
Sally? I was beginning to think he wasn't gonna leave. <+++++> I'm in here.
And you're going to have time. There's been a change of plans. <+++++> A change of plans?
We have that in common. <+++++> Then you two must have a long talk-
'76? <+++++> '74, I think.
Sad in a way. Why is it we don't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them? <+++++> Alright! Alright... put me down...
No, I think it was always you. It's very strange. <+++++> You're flushed. And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever. What are you doing?
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD! <+++++> Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
Yeah. <+++++> So, it's over?

Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>! <+++++> I might as well be. I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see. I blew it.
Did he give you his politicians? <+++++> Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all. I guess you've figured it all out?
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business -- <+++++> -- well, if you're gonna go --
You should hope quite a while. <+++++> And then --?
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways. <+++++> The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars. $100 minimum, straight poker.
Buzz off. <+++++> I will, old boy, tomorrow. Our work is done here. Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again. We have to so it ourselves. <+++++> That's not my mission.
I'm getting a chest cold.. <+++++> Bartok... a question.
What about my father? <+++++> Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
Oh, thank you. <+++++> My pleasure.
Ah -- that's where reason took hold. <+++++> Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever.
Wait a minute. What's wrong with you, man? <+++++> I'm fine.
What's that? <+++++> A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
We're not discussing your age. <+++++> Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
What? <+++++> Glasses.
I could shoot your cousin Eddie. <+++++> Why?
What's that mean? <+++++> Sideways -  For every yard we go this way, we also slide sideways this way....
Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy. He's my suspect. <+++++> He's my subordinate!

Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself. <+++++> Don't worry, I'll be quick. Just stay here, no sense everybody getting drenched.
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse. <+++++> It is a little coarse, yes.
...that's a good motto. <+++++> Fine, I'll get you a bumpersticker, but you better start believing it! It's the only statement you need to make.
What right? Do you want me to tell you? <+++++> Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything. <+++++> You sure?
That leaves two strangers. <+++++> So far.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good? <+++++> Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house.
After he tried to shoot you? <+++++> He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him. He needed us.

"Money." So you can get dome money... <+++++> I can try.
We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them. <+++++> Me?
The name Van Tassel is blackened. You share that name. <+++++> Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say it, out and out.
Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you? <+++++> I've heard it said that way.
You're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself? <+++++> I've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall.
Not you. The real wife. You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there? <+++++> Dead. He'd broken her neck.
I'll bet you're glad I waited until the last day to have this conversation. <+++++> You have no idea. Now run away.
I think I would rather just turn them over. <+++++> I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going.
Too old. <+++++> But if you could?
Of course I'm scared. <+++++> Then you should go.
...when I... <+++++> ...what has she done to harm you...?
Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head. <+++++> Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
They're not waiting for spring! Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion. Even John Adams voted against it... <+++++> Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that? After all you've done, it's unbelievable!
Headache? Dehydration? <+++++> The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book. <+++++> It's been a while.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing-- <+++++> She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
You look tired. <+++++> What's your news?
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous? <+++++> I'm not nervous.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust? <+++++> It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend.
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall? But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand... <+++++> What do you know of my husband?
Very big spider. <+++++> Yeah?
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda? <+++++> No.
No, I'm fine... I got it together.... <+++++> ...but...
Are you sure? <+++++> I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
What? <+++++> On the tape! There was something else on the tape.
I said that? <+++++> You said you can make it so they gotta turn the page.
You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was. <+++++> Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town.
Tell me what you really think. <+++++> Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.

Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we? <+++++> No. It's a down payment.
I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown. <+++++> Why the fuck didn't you invite me? I would've come.
What is it? <+++++> It's something for executives.
You fucked up little prick! <+++++> Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh? <+++++> You crazy? Hit him with what?
Nothing. You'd think she was crazy. And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not. <+++++> Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S. And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean... <+++++> Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
Nah, just covered with batshit! <+++++> They went out over there: must be some kind of exit.
You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go. <+++++> I know.
Just reporters. <+++++> I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's... <+++++> ...frozen! So if you don't mind--!
Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady. <+++++> I thought you didn't recognize me.
Thank you. Will you bury Geoffrey? I know he's dead. <+++++> I'm sorry, Katharine.
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>. <+++++> Why?
You don't have to show me anything, Mr. Rogers. I believe you. <+++++> I'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without having to get the story published. Not that I care about him.
Give it some time, Ellen...See what happens. <+++++> Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....
Oh! I thought maybe we could have a drink together? <+++++> Think again!
No, sir. Radar. <+++++> It could have been anything.
What do we do with him? <+++++> Leave him till we can get some help. From now on, nobody comes down here.
Oh my god... this is his house... _we're in his fucking house_... <+++++> Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?

All right. Now let's get to bed. <+++++> Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else. <+++++> Benjamin -- do they know you?
He does this every year? <+++++> It's the worst job since keymaster.
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it? <+++++> I didn't want it to turn out this way.
Jeffrey told her last night. <+++++> Last night?
You take her. <+++++> No Lloyd. Chicks are for fags - I'm not going to do it.
What is it? What's going on? Where are we? <+++++> You're safe. We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me. <+++++> No, they didn't. You have a wonderful voice.
Who did it? <+++++> Don't know. But this guy's real damaged goods. Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.
What is that? <+++++> Take it.
Uhh... <+++++> Goodnight, Ike, we're all going to bed.
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks. <+++++> Stop staring. Do a vase.

Louise! Where are you? Are you alright? Honey... <+++++> Hi. I'm okay. How are you? Long time no see.
No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds. <+++++> That's very practical. I hate going out on New Year's Eve, too.
Cut it out, Pa. He'p Al with the truck. Don't fret, honey. You goin' to be awright. <+++++> Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live.
Did you hit him? <+++++> I didn't hit shit!
You didn't get legal advice? <+++++> We didn't want to get mixed up with lawyers. They are very expensive here.
Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer. <+++++> You've killed but you're not a killer
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand. <+++++> Mike's our Attorney General down here.
You're late, not me. <+++++> You coulda been in front --
You're really going to send it to De Mille? <+++++> This is the right day.
What the hell do you know about bad time. You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family. <+++++> And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell. Now drop it!
It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is. <+++++> What is it really?
Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed! <+++++> Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
There's nothing on the news about a crash. Did he say what airline? <+++++> He didn't say much at all. Honey --
I always wanted to try that. <+++++> Only don't try putting words in my mouth.
My troops don't make policy. <+++++> Well, they die for it!
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George. <+++++> How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining. <+++++> No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
What? <+++++> This stays between you and I. We finally have an edge. I don't want to lose it.
Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything? <+++++> Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ...
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable? <+++++> Depends on what you're seeing.
Start of what? <+++++> I don't know, yet. What we do know is his performances are increasing in scale, not decreasing.
They'll be back. <+++++> Oh, come on! Can't you be happy for one split second? They're gone!
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean. All those guys were in your platoon? <+++++> Yeah.
Mikey look at this-- <+++++> What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets here.
Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter. <+++++> You like it? I'll send you a box.
What? <+++++> Ssh.
You've been listening to rumors. <+++++> Our cars were seen together in Felton. They're calling me an accessory to murder.
Recently, then. <+++++> No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit. <+++++> One thing at a time, Laz.
Don't you mean work me? <+++++> Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
IÂm working hard for you here, Jack. On Christmas too! Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way. I was moved... <+++++> Please. Just tell me whatÂs happening to me. In plain English. None of that mumbo jumbo...
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow. <+++++> He ain't the only one.
Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am! <+++++> What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
What happened? <+++++> Please pardon me. I am Niccolo Spergazzi. I am a resident here.
No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though. <+++++> You here for the summer?
Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal. <+++++> That's gross.
Shut up! <+++++> She knows it was our fault!
I'm sorry? <+++++> Pull your motherfucking pants down.
Who you talkin' to, Studs? Me, or Buddy. I can't tell, you got those shades on. <+++++> You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
Just perfect. <+++++> A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty.
A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans. Blueprints. <+++++> For what?
You. <+++++> Why?
.....What are you doing? <+++++> Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind.
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude. <+++++> The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays.
Those are my terms. <+++++> They're IMPOSSIBLE!! Jesus! I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??! Who is this TONY CLIFTON? !
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors. <+++++> Kitty, where exactly do you place the microphone to catch the most incriminating moans?
What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan. <+++++> Well, there are. And we don't need to go anywhere near that far.
This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart. <+++++> He had no choice. You're a formidable adversary.
She doesn't give a shit about him. <+++++> You know what would be great?
There's still time, take me up on my offer. <+++++> I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.
That's word for word. <+++++> Is it? I've forgotten.
He's tough. A brute. But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl. <+++++> I like. When do movie shoot?
What's wrong with you? Shut up! <+++++> The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
What should I do? <+++++> Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do.
...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem. <+++++> What rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing? The sorts of things you've...
I think you'd look good in red. <+++++> No, she's talking about your hair.
85,000 dollars. <+++++> Missing??? ?
Evelyn Waugh? <+++++> What?
Well,  what seems to be the trouble? <+++++> They're doctors?
Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now. <+++++> Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. You should be proud to be the same condition.
Can't hardly tell. Don't swallow the blood -- Go for his ribs. Don't let 'im breathe. <+++++> ...The guy's great.
Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy. <+++++> What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that.
I went out. <+++++> What's that kissing on the mouth shit?
Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests. <+++++> Your guests, ma'am?
I'm double-checking every case, but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on. <+++++> Slow down a second, you met with Low --
He's okay. <+++++> Should I fuck him?
Why? <+++++> He's too cool. Too sharp. I think he's got something to do with it.
They're just lonely is all. Hell, I howl myself sometimes. <+++++> You get lonely?
Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs. <+++++> It'll be like taking candy from a stranger.
Donna's gonna be angry about her cat. <+++++> Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.
...Joe. <+++++> No...you idiot!
You flew all the way h... <+++++> I noticed. I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
Fascinating. <+++++> That kid is one horny retard.
If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C. <+++++> In other words, scurvy.
It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth. <+++++> Of course not.
Sir, I- <+++++> Please be quiet.
No. <+++++> Are you in love with her?
No, no, of course not. You are young... <+++++> I'm not jealous!
Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight? <+++++> No, I didn't have to.
Now there's the poet speaking! Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see. NOW! <+++++> I... I close my eyes. His image floats beside me.
It's like the Cracker Jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."... <+++++> I got things to do.
You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him? <+++++> Uh huh.
Sure, that's no secret. <+++++> What's your name?
What is it? <+++++> You wouldn't believe me.
... fifty thousand dollars? <+++++> I don't want to leave her. Dick ...the, the ... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will ...
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares.... <+++++> It could have been an accident....
Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back. <+++++> But not flush against the tunnel?
No. <+++++> I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine. <+++++> No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Nothing? <+++++> Everything... everything's so funny...
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine. <+++++> I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder...
Whaddya want? I thought you were locked up- <+++++> I want the money, asshole, what do you think? The money that Reggie hid...
Can I forget it? <+++++> Yes.
Yikes. <+++++> Yeah, icky. This one guy stops and I look in and he's got his thing out waving it around like a drunk monkey.
Hi, Brad. <+++++> Sis.
Of course, senor. <+++++> Thank you.
My dory. The Jolly Mon. Where is it? <+++++> Safe! At Port Royal. With the Royal Navy.
Uh...uh... Mounties. The Mounties Guard The Border. uh... those Mountie Hats. <+++++> They look stupid.
How old are you? <+++++> That's not really a very proper question.
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable. <+++++> Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard.
Next week, Brother Minister. <+++++> Has the Reverend called? Is he going to show?
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen? <+++++> It's not. It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
Admiral Janeway. Good to see you. <+++++> 
Oh, gosh no. <+++++> I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on.
Sam, what are we going to do with you? Can you hear me, Sam? <+++++> Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she? !
I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you. <+++++> It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me. <+++++> You watch me.
Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good. I love you Jacko, you know that <+++++> Yes, I know that.
Oh, no. <+++++> ... what?...
We have all -- what? <+++++> Night. I'm going to stay with you.
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - - <+++++> What one?
Yeah. <+++++> So you're gonna leave it on. Every night. For a week.
No water. <+++++> You know what you're doing? You are interfering with my plans !
Oh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit. <+++++> I'm afraid I don't understand.
Shit <+++++> George...
A half mill on an eight to one shot. You're dumber than I thought, Lonnegan. <+++++> You're more gutless than I thought.
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it? <+++++> No. But I'm open to distractions.
You don't like my voice...? <+++++> I don't like the song.
A hacker planted the virus. <+++++> Virus?

Has anyone seen the young one? Ali? <+++++> Has anyone checked the coring room?
Yes! Free concert! <+++++> Alright, Pony!
Locked. <+++++> Stand back.
I want to know what my child is going to face. <+++++> Then you have on of those 'feelings.' It was called: 'love.'
Jesus creeping shit! <+++++> Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig? !
Yup. <+++++> Doing the bachelor party thing?
Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it. <+++++> For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
Ohhh. Do you know the East Village? <+++++> Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
Geology. <+++++> Splendid!
Right! Where? <+++++> Wisconsin.

Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight. <+++++> Chinese food?
Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I... <+++++> It was nothing.
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night. <+++++> You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
Contain it and get back to me. <+++++> What do you mean by 'contain?'
You alright? <+++++> Kristen...
What happened? <+++++> It...almost got you.
Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms... <+++++> Altitude fifty kilometers...
Nope. Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume? <+++++> Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
YOU DID. <+++++> YOU KNIT?
But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me. <+++++> That's all swell. Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime. <+++++> It's okay.
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission. <+++++> Well, you goddam well should.
Yorgi asked me to. <+++++> You do everything Yorgi says?
I guess so. <+++++> It's hard to know where to start.
Hey, baby, that's good! How'd we come out? <+++++> We won.
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too. <+++++> Save my son, d'Artagnan.
I'm serious. <+++++> Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
The nightmares. <+++++> He's excited about the script. You should be too. It stars you.
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute. <+++++> Be careful, Peter.
What do you mean, help? <+++++> I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city.
Ludwig. <+++++> Oskar.
I need a favor. <+++++> That requires me goin' out tonight?
EXCUSE MEÂ <+++++> Please don't go.
Probably because they know a psycho when they hear one. <+++++> No...
Wait? <+++++> Where is he? Where's the bastard that runs this shit hole?
Sorry. It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today. Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists. <+++++> Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there. <+++++> I won't.
Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over. <+++++> Okay.
Birds? <+++++> Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
It's all right with me. Is he here? <+++++> My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie. <+++++> Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
I see a sign. Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit. <+++++> Perfect.
He's dead Sheila. <+++++> I feel sick.
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett. <+++++> I don't do groups.
All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all. It should never have happened. <+++++> I want to settle things tonight. I want my father left alone.
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you. <+++++> Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo. <+++++> I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
Oh no. I really like it sometimes. And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you. <+++++> But him is you. Now I'm confused.
He knows. <+++++> You sound so sure.
Where are you going? <+++++> Hunting.
Trouble? <+++++> We've been ordered to -
What do you know about Michael? <+++++> I know he's alive. People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead. But I know. I've always known.
Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde. [11] <+++++> All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now.
The Miracle Kid. <+++++> Yes, yes you may notice that he cannot even bring himself to utter his name, he... he refers to him as K.
I had a good time tonight. <+++++> I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
Jason.. <+++++> We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
But, you got four children! <+++++> I want one with you.
Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline. <+++++> If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
Good argument for gun-control. What are you going after, rhino? <+++++> Nah. I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds. 'Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.
We should try fishing again. <+++++> You mean it?
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat. <+++++> You think you're so god damned smart, don't you?
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know. <+++++> Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take a charter flight. <+++++> Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
Objection! <+++++> Overruled. The witness will answer, please.
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson. <+++++> Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
Do what you do to Simone. I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night. <+++++> You're with me to be close to her?
Promise you what? <+++++> That you're not crazy.
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters? <+++++> She sure does.
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission -- <+++++> Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right? He's said and done things your husband would never do ... <+++++> Whoever you are, don't call again.
Then why are you here? <+++++> For the same reason you are.
Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me - <+++++> Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you. I'll be in it, too, won't I? And Junior?
William would never have gone to a state school. <+++++> William didn't even go to high school
Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal! <+++++> Fuck you, Rosen!
Fuck off, you stupid asshole. <+++++> It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy? <+++++> I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
Daffodils? <+++++> They're your favorite flower.
Gump, is it? <+++++> Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
"Gorsky"? What is that, Polish? <+++++> Yes.
The suspects! They won't come. <+++++> Oh, they'll come. I'll have Guild issue the invitations.
Okay. But is this about the posters? <+++++> Possibly. Please just wait outside.
Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great. <+++++> Don't eat the red ones.
Hi. <+++++> Need any help?
Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you. <+++++> Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man, don't I?
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride. Is that it? <+++++> More or less.
What does that have to do with you? <+++++> I honestly don't know.
Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility. <+++++> "Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories? he said as he removed her brassiere..."
You'll do it? <+++++> Yes, I'll do it. Just leave my family alone.
Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday. <+++++> That shirt?
That. <+++++> Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
What happened...? <+++++> They, uh, they got to my witness.
I'm tired of dealing with peons. I need to get to whoever's in charge. <+++++> Nobody knows, pal. Nobody gets the big picture...  Jason, Tommy, cut it out!
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now. <+++++> Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx.
Send to commander Enterprise: "We stand ready to assist you. Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior." Attach our co-ordinates. <+++++> Is that wise, sir? I mean, given their situation -  Aye, sir.
No. No, I don't. <+++++> I'm sorry that I frightened you like that. But I was so touched by your concern. I've been lonely here.
You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown. <+++++> They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay? It wasn't my idea.
Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before? <+++++> Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them. We just didn't tell <u>you</u>.
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett. <+++++> What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?
Have you ever had a nocturnal emission? <+++++> Huh?
[It's non-negotiable.] <+++++> [Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
Morse code? <+++++> Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
Yes. <+++++> Well, that's good enough for me.
My God. <+++++> What?
Uh... Everything okay? <+++++> Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
Rick...? <+++++> I'm sorry, Jim. I can't talk now. I'll call you tonight...I'm sorry. I'm coming, Ray.
Masseria's been after me too. <+++++> Thank you for keeping me informed.
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this. <+++++> ... Oh? Why is that, Vicki?
Excuse me? <+++++> No, it's just -- you are American, aren't you?
Anything. <+++++> Promise you won't forget me.
Wolfi! Your father is dead. <+++++> What?
Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that? <+++++> Slaughterhouse.
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny. <+++++> Yeah, well, that's why this machine is dynamite.
Never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday. <+++++> Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.
An idea, yeah. <+++++> Like?
Blackburn's dead. <+++++> Excuse me?
The future guy? <+++++> Yeah, but, no kidding around, he's a good guy, a real good guy...
You smell like trouble -- <+++++> I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
Pack, darling, get your things, pack. <+++++> Where are we going?
The massive fellow... Brom. For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy. <+++++> He has proposed to me twice.
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me. <+++++> Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break. <+++++> Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.
It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way. <+++++> You got it.
What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere. <+++++> We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
Where is she now, by the way? Do you know? <+++++> I don't. No exactly.
To meet some friends. Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker... <+++++> Huh?
It's not one of these? <+++++> You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
I must really be slacking off. Hungry? <+++++> Uh...sure...I...what?
And the shape of it all. It was sort of...shapeless. <+++++> Really? I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
I don't know. <+++++> You were there?
She knows not to steal. I've taught her better than that. <+++++> Yeah, but you're not her parents, anymore, you and Helen. Her parents are Axl Rose and Madonna.
Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news. <+++++> How is that good news?
I was acting in the town's best interests... <+++++> The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing.
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks. <+++++> Do I get a kiss?
You ready? <+++++> Are you coming to eat with us?
Lord Wessex. You have been waiting. <+++++> I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.
Alla puttanesca. <+++++> Isn't she great? What did I tell you? A talent.
Tsk. I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays. You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it? <+++++> Don't drown.
How did you know -- <+++++> I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
I've got photographs of you at the Trenton Ramada looking very-- <+++++> That ain't me.
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know. <+++++> I... didn't know where you lived.
Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head? <+++++> You think this is all very funny.
The usual. Plane crash. Survivers unknown. Routine stuff really. <+++++> Anything else?
My God... <+++++> Alex, it's just the zoo.
He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie. <+++++> I thought he was a big tall fat fellow. Didn't I meet him here one time?
I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape... <+++++> Jean, it's... it's not so easy...
Relax, don't jam it... <+++++> FUCKING THING!! !
I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not! Stuff a mattress with me! Hah! <+++++> I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not. Bee-hive -- bah!
Hi....what....what's up....? <+++++> It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
Who's Miss Johnson? <+++++> Miss Johnson is a teacher, and...
I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank. Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball. <+++++> Yeah.
Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that! <+++++> Shut up! All of you!
There's something weird going on here, Suzie. <+++++> No shit.
It makes me sick to see him like that. <+++++> Isn't there some way we can get it off him?
I just wanted to know where Mom was? <+++++> Oh. Sorry.
But Richard, no, I, I -- <+++++> -- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here?
I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date? <+++++> ...3407 2627 3444 8095 expiration 05/04.
Don't tell me, partner. I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang. <+++++> The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
Vada, Vada, what's the matter? <+++++> Where's Daddy?
No! Why would I want to kill him? <+++++> Because you were jealous. Because he cut you out of the will.
Romeo in reverse. Uh-uh. No sale, Killaine. <+++++> You don't buy it. Okay. So I still want Betty Mayfield. Where is she?
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones. <+++++> Shit. When?
 <+++++> You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond? <+++++> I'm trying to tell you. This is an enormous place. Eight master bedrooms. A sunken tub in every bathroom.
Wait -- what're you doing? <+++++> I'm going down.
Any more, O -- ? <+++++> You guys are through...
Your boss is quite a card player, Carver. How does he do it? <+++++> He cheats.
You lost me. <+++++> Dunwitty wants a Coon show.
Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears. <+++++> I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships... <+++++> Who else?
Who are you gonna call? <+++++> I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
Yes? <+++++> Order me a pastrami for after?
Pitiful rookerful... <+++++> And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
Going active. <+++++> Jerry?
Oh no. <+++++> ...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
I haven't been sick this year. I know that. <+++++> Okay.
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper. <+++++> The hell I am!
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker. <+++++> I've never fired anyone in my life.
Sorry. <+++++> I'm a full-blood Oglala.
Two. <+++++> 
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me? <+++++> Oh, I'm already swooning.
She has no real grip on reality. <+++++> Does anybody?
Then what kinda stuff can we do? <+++++> Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND. <+++++> I DO respect your mind! It turns me on! It makes me wanna fuck the shit out of you! Don't you see?
How fast is enough? <+++++> I want to go faster!
Maybe. I could have stopped it, though. <+++++> Since you're feeling guilty, why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it?
What the heck is THIS?! ! <+++++> Honey, I have a little secret to share with you.
Put your hands on the wheel. <+++++> You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
What does she do? <+++++> She's an editor.
See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller. Ones, fives, tens. Like that. <+++++> I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this -- <+++++> Quit worryin' about Elaine.
Anything else you want to add before I talk to her? <+++++> No.
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe? <+++++> Maybe.
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but... <+++++> But you wanted to fuck me first.
No, I'm gonna drive. <+++++> No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
Don't try to change to the subject. <+++++> Why don't you answer?
What's your worst memory of childhood? Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention. <+++++> The death of my father.
I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department. <+++++> Yah.
How'd you get it? <+++++> It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.
Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love... <+++++> And we're going away for a holiday.
Oh. How long I been here? <+++++> Three days. Are you hungry?
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct. <+++++> I am?
You think you're working with chimps here? <+++++> The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you there? What are you thinking? <+++++> Nothing.
I'm not. She just left. <+++++> What did she say?
Well why do you -- why do you think that? <+++++> Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
They check in alone? <+++++> They checked in alone.
Don't tell me your ticket was in it? <+++++> No, I've got that, all right. But my money. All I have here is four dollars.
I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurtÂ What more do you want? <+++++> Much more, Terry. Much, much more!
Traitor! ! <+++++> No. You are the traitor. You are murderer. I am director. Action!
I can handle it. <+++++> I know you can. But I'd like to.
Can you see the other PIRs? <+++++> Got it.
In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? <+++++> Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage.
You're hanging on better here than you did in America. <+++++> This is a different situation, Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century.
And you don't? <+++++> He leads, I follow.
The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction... <+++++> Thank-you for reminding me.
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all. <+++++> You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
Oh, wait a minute, now I see where you're going. <+++++> Please, Letty.
You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight? <+++++> I'll make parole.
I'm surprised he bothered with it. <+++++> He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
And we're very grateful. <+++++> Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.
Lotsa weird shit in there. I saw this statue. Pillar. Thing. I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club. <+++++> Would you know this store again?
Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had the same problems as "Chad" the stockbroker. <+++++> Yes.
He did. <+++++> It was under control, Bud. Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress. <+++++> Both of them?
I'm not good at lying. <+++++> Get good at it.
You have not slept with your husband for five years? <+++++> Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
Paul, get out! <+++++> So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me --
Your leg will be fine. A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces. <+++++> You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.
Does this sound weird? <+++++> Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight. <+++++> Whatsamatter?
I'm fine, fine. <+++++> You Rolfe? I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't. <+++++> My brother said you were about to fire me.
Why does he have a lock on his door? <+++++> Because he put the lock on! Do you think I told him he could have a nose ring?!
Would four of them -- ? <+++++> No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
I don't know. <+++++> Why are you saying it?
You need me. <+++++> No, no, I don't. I thank you, I really do. Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time. <+++++> Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston. <+++++> Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
That's all past, Lestat. <+++++> Yes. Past... she should never have been one of us...
Whatever kind they wanted her to be. <+++++> James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing. The best thing for you. I promise. <+++++> ...All right, Eve. If you say so.
I've thought about you every second since I left. I can still taste you on my lips. <+++++> Stop it.
Where's the child? <+++++> Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me. Yesterday happily retired, today right back in the thick of things.
You'll put your clothes here. <+++++> There's no mirror.
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it... <+++++> WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?! WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something. <+++++> Diane, everybody loves that you showed up.
Not so fast, Dick. Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase. <+++++> What?
Must have been in the war. That might account for the cane and his limp. <+++++> Yes... yes.
Oh no. No, please. <+++++> What is it? What's the matter?
You're tired. <+++++> Jerry--
How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think? <+++++> That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy.
Yes? What is it? <+++++> Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
Gay movies. <+++++> Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
You cannot say that! <+++++> No? Was Mozart a good man?
 <+++++> Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.
I told you what happened in Rome! <+++++> Do you expect me to believe...?
What are you doing? <+++++> Getting dressed. I've got to go.
What the fuck are you talkin' about? <+++++> Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
Akina delutan, nou-shan. <+++++> ...'Scuse me?
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper. <+++++> If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away? <+++++> Why --
You heard about that? <+++++> Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
Hold on a second! <+++++> Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
Can I have a month's vacation? <+++++> With pay!
No, I mentioned it only in passing. <+++++> Incidentally I mention only in passing that I could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession.
Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him? <+++++> Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
Are you anywhere near the penthouse? <+++++> No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
...you don't even know what you're looking for. <+++++> You said that thing was big as your hand. I don't think I'm going to miss...
You told me to come by. <+++++> Did you want to play ball with us?
There won't be ... there won't be ... What else do you need? How else can we help you? <+++++> All right ... I got some hungry people in there ... I want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...
What's my name? <+++++> Doyle.
Do you have an appointment? <+++++> Yes
They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her? <+++++> How do I know?
"Leo", I says, "Hunsecker froze me out. So I'm eating humble pie this month - please print me an item." <+++++> And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
Pretty scary, huh? <+++++> Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
It was on the TV. <+++++> When was the last time you saw Sal?
Have you ever stolen anything? <+++++> Nope.
Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player. <+++++> I only gamble with my life, never my money.
You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me David? <+++++> Not my place, sir. It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave. Then where would we be?
Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again! <+++++> Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
Fine. <+++++> Jack is a schoolteacher.
My river... my people... my jungle... my ideas... my country... my wife...  ... my death. <+++++> You had immense plans... immense plans...
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you? <+++++> Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up! <+++++> Oh, I almost forgot... I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
Al. Man, you were my rock. I couldn't have made it without you. <+++++> Bullshit.
I like to dress in women's clothing. <+++++> Are you a fruit?
Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you? <+++++> She couldn't.
What? <+++++> Did you change cabs? It didn't work, something moved there--
Damn, they always stick me with the clunker. <+++++> Take my van!
I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you? <+++++> No, uh...
10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements. <+++++> Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
Look of things, she doesn't. <+++++> Yeah. Keep a closer eye on her --  And him. Shootin' going on, we'll never find Lednov.
We've been attacked. <+++++> I know, I know, it's all right. Come in this way. It's mined over there. This way. It's all right.
And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway? <+++++> Sunday, but...
What have I done? <+++++> Aw, cheer up, George'll probably be running Fox by the morning. Let's get a drink.
What good will that do? <+++++> Maybe he'll have some advice. Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
Yes. <+++++> You told him I was here and he wanted to know if I was beating you up.
I can't believe Jenny told you all that. About me. She was always so embarrassed. <+++++> Not embarrassed.
I don't care. I need my hat. I won't go without it. <+++++> What could I do? If she insisted, I had to drive her home for her goddamn hat.
The usual, Barry. <+++++> I'll have, like, a beer. Like a Budweiser, or something.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually. <+++++> Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
Do I look like I need your money. It doesnÂt work like that and I canÂt tell you why. <+++++> Why not?
Can I be of service, Miss Price? <+++++> Dr. Hirsch?
No, sir. <+++++> Oh, you're a reactionary!
I recognized him too - his picture was in Vanity Fair. <+++++> Vanity Fair?
Ha! Go back! What a great line! <+++++> You like it?
Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna. <+++++> I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy.
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown. <+++++> And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
Frank. We gotta go back. Frank... <+++++> Stay with me, Gib. We're gonna do this.
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up. <+++++> I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do! And I swear, I didn't do any of the stuff I did!
Uh-huh? <+++++> We have to be very careful. No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.
...doing? ! <+++++> I need your truck!
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs. <+++++> Hello.
Sammy's? <+++++> He still having parties?
That bad? <+++++> Worse.
What is it with crack and transsexuals? <+++++> Yeah, Eddie was a real character. Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street. There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels.... <+++++> ...but big.
What do you mean? <+++++> Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
Exactly. <+++++> Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz. <+++++> Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
Hollywood, mainly. <+++++> And what did your parents do?
Look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time. And I have to get home to my family. <+++++> You're not going anywhere.
But I'm going first... <+++++> Anything you say, Mammacitta.
I'm sure that's true for some of them. <+++++> I thought I was the pro. These women make me feel like an amateur.
I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me. <+++++> He's liable to shoot you.
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago. <+++++> Can't blame me for trying. You look as beautiful as that painting I just bought.
... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere. <+++++> I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
What's wrong with your hand? <+++++> Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak!
Yeah, no problem. <+++++> We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
 <+++++> Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
That's right, the guys are moving them downtown. After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch. After the contest. <+++++> You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
I won't ask again. <+++++> I work alone. Like you...  ...we always work alone.
Will this do? <+++++> It's perfect.
Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead. <+++++> You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you?
Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough? <+++++> Roy, I don't want money from you.
I hope it brings you luck. <+++++> It will.
Could I tell him what it's regarding? <+++++> His daughter, for God's sake-- I need to know if he's heard from her this morning.
No, you're not wrong-- <+++++> Am I wrong!
No. He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition. <+++++> He seems to have won it.
Well, I didn't want to assume. <+++++> Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
What? ? <+++++> The minute the story broke I bundled her on the first Concord out of here.
Easy, hon, I was just looking for fun details -- <+++++> Oh, well, why didn't you say so?
Mm. <+++++> Yeah. So, what about you?
I always, I-I always imagine that I have things. <+++++> When did you first notice this?
They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s. I know this for a fact. <+++++> You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
I never said... <+++++> ...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.
 <+++++> Thanks, Max. I'm touched by your concern.
Naw. Any good? <+++++> Suzanne Somers' tits.
How can you say it? <+++++> Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters. When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters.
You're talking to me? <+++++> Why do you polish it?
Maybe. <+++++> Well. I'm sorry, sir, but we've got to ask you for it.
They thought she'd be coming to me. <+++++> Left Phoenix under her own steam?
Then find another theater <+++++> You don't think I've tried? No one is willing to open the picture
They're going to stop me talking to you. <+++++> There's no one here.
I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in. <+++++> And that was the last time you saw him?
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself! <+++++> He's not you!
Shocking abuse of authority. <+++++> I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule. Is the Pelican flying?
O-o-o-oh... <+++++> What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
I do not want those cigarettes. <+++++> Yes, you do!
As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark. <+++++> A little boy whistling in the dark!?
Will the police do anything to her? <+++++> It's too late for that. She can't drive the bus anymore. The school board saw to that right off.
I'll say she is! <+++++> Nice lines--
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that. <+++++> So you married your father's business partner?
Can't you see this is a special moment? <+++++> I was just making it more special.
I quit. <+++++> You quit.
But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled? <+++++> Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.
What is the common thread between these victims? <+++++> I'm sure I don't know.
But how can he? He'll kill you. <+++++> This isn't about me anymore.
Kyle? <+++++> I'm wrong here. I wasn't meant to see this...
Aahhh... So what color is it? <+++++> What?
Star. <+++++> Oh. Your folks, too, huh?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? <+++++> EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE. ..NOW WE'RE RIGHT WITH YOU. YOU ARE INVERTED. ROLL IT, COUGAR.
 <+++++> What are you doing, Wendy? What's in that cup?
This. Above all. <+++++> And then you'll be happy?
I adore anything to do with the arts. <+++++> We're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?
Their arms? <+++++> They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition... Other than that, ask what you wish.
It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any. <+++++> That's because we live in the future. Which is what's on my mind.
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright... <+++++> Sure Roger, whatever you want, it's cool.
I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue. <+++++> You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
What are ya, deaf? Turn around! <+++++> NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT!
Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty! <+++++> The hell you say! Wash is kin!
What's the matter? The fight gone out of you? I'm just gonna smash a headlight. Maybe two. <+++++> Please, just leave the car alone.
You've got to help them. <+++++> Can you help <u>me</u>?
I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today. <+++++> I see. Then what brought you up here?
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera. <+++++> You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
Yeah, thanks Walter. That gives me a very secure feeling. <+++++> Dude--
All tapped out. <+++++> I'll float you.
I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would. I have to go to Belvedere. <+++++> You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
Describe him. <+++++> Tall, short-haired, scary eyes. Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY. <+++++> How could you?
It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk - <+++++> Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are.
I suppose you don't believe me. <+++++> No.
The flamethrower! <+++++> I can't, the acid will pour out!
There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben-- <+++++> --Santiago.
You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you. <+++++> Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit.
My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer. <+++++> Oh. How old?
You have to leave the house immediately! <+++++> I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
Let me drive... <+++++> Get away from me... get away! She means that much to you, you stay with her.
Yeah. Big fan. <+++++> And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie? <+++++> I think you should establish a good line of credit.
It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance -- <+++++> Hey! Where's that martini? !
It's Mom. <+++++> What? What is it?
We've met before. <+++++> Oh yeah, the insurance guy.
You're mocking me, aren't you? <+++++> Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look! An alien!
What? <+++++> Daddy's very ill.
I got you cold, pal. Make it easy for yourself, use your head. <+++++> I didn't do nothing wrong! That was Mayolia's! I didn't ask her for it. I don't know about any -
He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona. <+++++> Verona again.
You made me have an abortion. <+++++> It was a mutual decision.
I'm not certain, Mister President. But I believe it was four. <+++++> General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?
How? <+++++> As our bodies atrophied our minds... compensated.
Why do you think I called? <+++++> I get a lot of calls. Most of them are from people who say they know things.
Well -- I guess so. <+++++> You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
We have a library? <+++++> A bad one. It was the only book in there. Norman, come here, look at this.
Do you hunt? <+++++> Occasionally.
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit? ! <+++++> Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
Unicorn -- a kind of animal -- <+++++> What do they look like?
Carcharadon Carcharias. <+++++> That's it.
In the direction you want to go. <+++++> You guys got any black capsules?
You are the first person I have ever told any of this to. We are birds of a feather ELLEN...we're in the same league <+++++> I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues.
How am I doin'? <+++++> Real good.
A football game? <+++++> Special Services in Tokyo are all for it.
That was a compliment. <+++++> Will you go with me?
I don't know, but somebody did. <+++++> Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.
... Yes. <+++++> I give you this. You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
Oh, that rumour about crosses? <+++++> You can't look at them...
Oh, yes. I heard. <+++++> Yes. Personally, I think it's silly, too.
Ryuji and Gruner. <+++++> And Dieter.
Surely not. <+++++> I'm telling you. Hang on. How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...
I'd hardly describe It that way Â- The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing. <+++++> It seems right to us.
They don't even realize they should be frightened. <+++++> Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs.
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral. <+++++> No.
Take your hands off me animal! <+++++> Chain him.
A couple of high rollers like you? <+++++> Could you believe it?
I know it's over, asshole, I -- <+++++> 
Hey ... you'll be able to do it now. <+++++> What ... ?
-- you shouldn't do me like that... <+++++> -- please, please forgive me...
I have a passionate girlfriend. <+++++> What's with the boxes?
July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear. Black Hand. <+++++> When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know. <+++++> It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.
You and I become a driving force on the local Geisha scene. <+++++> Not a prayer.
Yes. <+++++> Whose ratings were higher?
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you? <+++++> You got it.
What's happening? <+++++> Cassie, thank Christ! We're under attack.
Yes! I don't know...! I don't know. <+++++> Thank you, Clarice.
 <+++++> No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
 <+++++> Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the head nurse here. You've already met Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington and Warren. <+++++> Yes, ma'am.
What the hell are you doing in that trunk? ! <+++++> You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter. <+++++> She already has a daughter.
What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh... <+++++> Uh, narcolepsy.
A few day's nourishment will see your strength returning. <+++++> And then?
Oh, come on. <+++++> Ohh!
I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for. <+++++> Yes. Of course. But, I'm talking about that ring. It's something else. Let me tell you.
Such a racket I heard in your place -- maybe you had burglars. <+++++> Oh, you don't have to worry about that -- nothing in there that anybody would want to steal...  Good night, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
Oh, anywhere downtown. <+++++> You don't know where you're going?
I'm writing a book. <+++++> Really. What are you writing about.
I don't think so. <+++++> You're sure. Find out for me.
This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child. <+++++> He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age.
Annette, just use your hand. <+++++> They told me to practice.
It'll be fine, yeah. <+++++> Ai, bueno. Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars. <+++++> Wait a minute! Our problems might be solved.
You really want to do this, don't you? <+++++> 
Have fun tonight? <+++++> Tons
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it. <+++++> Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
Yes. <+++++> Where were you trained?
You take cream or sugar? <+++++> That'd be fine.
It won't register. It's too big to image. <+++++> Too big?
And why would I do that? <+++++> Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
Hence the expression... <+++++> ... Graveyard shift.
I hate the storm. I hate it! <+++++> The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me.
You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss. <+++++> What do you mean by that?
Don't get hurt. <+++++> I never do.
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha-- <+++++> I'm not interested. I want to create my own material.
It's called "The Philosophy of Time Travel". <+++++> What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman. <+++++> I've never seen a lobster.
Our former Commander was not... Strong. <+++++> Former Commander?
The fact is, I have to get going. <+++++> Is it true?
Don't do this. Don't psychoanalyze me. I hate squid. Period. Just like you hate jellyfish. <+++++> You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here. <+++++> Keep it elevated.
I'm glad you stayed. Thank you. <+++++> I'd better get back now.
Your feet are cold. <+++++> Go back to sleep.
If you come to Hawaii -- <+++++> Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
What happened to Gibarian? <+++++> Didn't you talk to Snow?
Man, I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man. <+++++> Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign. Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool.
God's sake, chief. The President was shot. <+++++> A bullshit President! I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs.
Check one-two. Check one-two. <+++++> Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed. <+++++> No, I'm fine.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff. <+++++> Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Oh lookit that brunette. <+++++> Mah baby! We're diggin' and dyin' but our boy Luke is lovin' and flyin'.
And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print. <+++++> To do what?
But I don't want you to make up something. <+++++> I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk.
You liked that? <+++++> Oh yeah. I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
No. Not very big. <+++++> The Regent is adding men. And he bought rifles and ammunition from India. Mountain guns, too.
Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim. <+++++> Jim was old enough...
There -- in the master's chair, sits the master -- my half-brother Paul Holland. But you've already met him. <+++++> Yes -- on the boat.
Of course, one must admit he has great courage. <+++++> I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities.
It was bad. <+++++> Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men! <+++++> Damn right! That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit. <+++++> Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man.
No. <+++++> I beg your pardon?
Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch. <+++++> Maybe she did, Gus. Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.
I love you, Chuck. <+++++> You too.
I do? <+++++> Yeah, a little. I think you grew an inch or so. And you've lost weight.
Then take her down. <+++++> Drop begins... now! Fifteen kilometers and dropping... twelve... ten... eight and slowing. Five. Three. Two. One kilometer and slowing.
Next week. <+++++> Wow, that's soon --
So. You're a soldier. Fighting for whom? <+++++> With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever... Which we already knew... <+++++> That's not quite what I said --
The zoo? Is he rational? <+++++> Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
I keep them hungry. When... when do we think this man arrives. <+++++> Is it necessary to know?
From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that? <+++++> 
I hope he doesn't have rabies. <+++++> He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
I broke my ankle skating. That ended that dream. <+++++> It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't it? To let go of what you want?
So do I. <+++++> We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird. <+++++> It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
What is it you find incredible? <+++++> Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully.
That's our case! <+++++> If that's your case, you didn't have a case. I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
Naw naw! <+++++> You don't like it, but you eat that shit. He eats it.
He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he? <+++++> Yes, he does.
Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton. <+++++> But you had more than that, and I know it. You and my father --  you had each other. Can I never have what you had?
It's 3+27 hundred <+++++> Three! I'm going to be late for my shift.
He was a crooked bastard. He would have killed us. <+++++> The police don't know that. And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.
What? <+++++> I want out of this marriage.
At last! A call! A cry of distress ...  Concorde! Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain! <+++++> I'm not quite dead, sir ...
The water tastes better in the kitchen. <+++++> That's true. Why is that?
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff? <+++++> No.
I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me. <+++++> I'm sorry. I can't do it.
All the more reason to eliminate him. <+++++> What if his accomplices have made copies?
Oui, doctor, oui. <+++++> Good morning...  We need a name for him, don't we?
Do they know them? <+++++> No, but I think I do.
Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait. <+++++> There's a charming thought.
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression -- <+++++> Hey -- shut up, okay?
So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight? <+++++> What is it with this guy?
More soldiers? <+++++> Scientists. Very intellegent men.
You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late. <+++++> Okay.
You gotta be kidding. <+++++> Not at all, just a pleasant way to have lunch.
Hmm. So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet? <+++++> Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath! <+++++> I bet you did.
Bet a nickel! <+++++> Whadaya bet, Cheswick?
I didn't want to spoil our supper... <+++++> You'd rather spoil our walk home.
CONTINUED <+++++> Well, what is it?
I didn't sell it. <+++++> Well, somebody bought it. That's what I heard.
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby. <+++++> Let me see that.
Why did they block the door again? <+++++> To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost? <+++++> I'm always serious.
Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this. <+++++> Is it someone we know?
What's the occasion? <+++++> I quit. Today's my last day.
Being a jerk is better than being nothing. <+++++> I never said you were "nothing".
I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright? <+++++> Alright.
Actually, that's my stage name. <+++++> I'm sorry?
... little Bobby. <+++++> Would you walk with me down to the paddock? I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.
Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well. <+++++> Sorry to hear it.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with. <+++++> I'm not.
This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further. If not, we can forget we had this conversation. <+++++> Sounds fine. I'll need to meet everybody.
Katharine! Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here? <+++++> I can't move. I can't get out.
Nineteen zero and nine. <+++++> No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada. <+++++> I think it should be outlawed.
What'd you just say? <+++++> Oh, that was my kid.
What? No. No. <+++++> You didn't?
Sure. <+++++> Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
Yeah. <+++++> Then come for dinner.
Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert... <+++++> I don't want Robert.
You're trusting. <+++++> Why do you say that?
Why can't you be serious? <+++++> There, you said it.
Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar! <+++++> Quellek. What are you doing in there?
I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded. It's been a sound policy. <+++++> No worries there. She's far more likely to rot out from under us.
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it. The Suit. <+++++> Do you always have to call him that? The Suit? It makes you sound like such a hick. His name is Michael.
Will you take it easy! <+++++> Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place? So it wouldn't fall into their hands! !
He always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical- <+++++> It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
Was I right? <+++++> Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
So where is young Jonah? <+++++> With a sitter. We have a sensational sitter. Jonah's really comfortable with her. You know, a second mom sort of.
Last show of the night. <+++++> Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp! Anybody else hurt?
S.A.C. He wants to prove that his yuppie agents are making good. He's offering you New York. Tell him you want Atlanta. <+++++> Why?
Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland. <+++++> What about Don?
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on? <+++++> I give up.
I just had a phone call. <+++++> Tell me, is it bad news?
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole. <+++++> What's the reading?
Stupid. <+++++> 
Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife? That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em. <+++++> I really gotta go.
Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him! <+++++> Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
How? <+++++> Your son has a very great talent.
Did you read the papers yesterday? <+++++> Yes.
I mean there's no way I can promise anything. I can't tell him what we're up to... <+++++> You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right? Just keep me outta prison.
Yes. <+++++> You liked your teachers?
Would they do that? <+++++> Who knows? That's why I filed it down.
You're just saying nothing! Tonight is the night. <+++++> Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there! <+++++> Aaauuuhhh!! !
For what? <+++++> For defending my honor this afternoon.
Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant. <+++++> No, that's quite all right.
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special. <+++++> ........... It's a bomb isn't it?
"Once a carnie, always a carnie." <+++++> Oh-yah.
Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ... <+++++> I'll make it short.
Are you alright, Wade? <+++++> Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
Goodnight Vada. <+++++> Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this. <+++++> What should I do?
He would have loved this. <+++++> Your father?
Thanks. That was good, that crow sound. <+++++> Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
Still. All's fair in love and w... <+++++> That would be a girl. I don't even know.
Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears. <+++++> This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.
Is Frank D'Angelo around? <+++++> At the bar - Sidney...
Well, he worked around. <+++++> And his age?
Old tricks are the best tricks eh? <+++++> I'm not going.
No. <+++++> Why not? I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
No. <+++++> No? No, what?
Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late. <+++++> That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
Hey Sandy. <+++++> Mikey was looking for you.
Unbelievable, she got to you. <+++++> Oh, please!
Two whole drums -- <+++++> We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too --
--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility. <+++++> Not a boast, sir, but a curse. Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out. <+++++> For what?
DON'T SAY "BILL," BERNIE! DON'T SAY ONE WORD! DIDN'T I SAY "ONE WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED?" <+++++> I...
The new girl is here. <+++++> Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
You can't come in. <+++++> What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I made a reservation for four o'clock, remember?
Grab a clue, Sam. You're a hired hand around here. Enjoy it while it lasts. <+++++> Goodbye, Sandra.
I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive. <+++++> Suspect Zero?
I know where you are. <+++++> Very good. How did you know?
They only took electrical appliances. <+++++> Serve the ball.
Who was there for your ass? <+++++> You were there for me.
 <+++++> I want nothing to do with the arena.
No, I'm not. <+++++> What are your plans in New York?
Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why. Your readership will be first and second year American collage students... <+++++> Freshman and sophomores...
I don't give a fuck about jail, I just don't wanna die. <+++++> You're not gonna fucking die, all right?
What happened? <+++++> I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
It's all here. <+++++> Pearl! Oh, Pearl!
I didn't say anything- <+++++> Well he's taken an interest!
They're happy like this. <+++++> David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set. You like all this don't you?
No you won't. <+++++> What do you mean?
You have good taste. French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus. <+++++> Whoever that is.
I didn't know you were funny. <+++++> I forgot myself.
Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else. <+++++> I wish I could believe that, Doctor.
I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you. <+++++> What?
Mr. Sim? Do you have him? He's alive? <+++++> Oh yeah, he's alive. Technically.
Yes... <+++++> We could live up here, live up in the country.
...you? Do you remember what I told you? <+++++> Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?!
Yeah, how much you wanna bet? <+++++> On what?
Do you like me better? <+++++> You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- a very good man.
She's not gonna know. <+++++> She wired this system.
I've read of it. <+++++> But have never been?
You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it? <+++++> I beg your pardon?
Yes. I would like to escort Eve. <+++++> Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.
Kirsty Cotton. Yes. But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back? <+++++> Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws. The protocol of Hell. The Box had to be opened to let me out.
Any thoughts on casting yet? <+++++> Leo? It was out to Jude Law. Jude passed.
What? <+++++> Frock's been fired.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much. You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life. <+++++> I know.
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love. <+++++> It is only too possible. Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
How come? <+++++> Could I have a glass of water, please? Please, Fraulein?
Do I have to dial '9' to get out? <+++++> I don't care who you dial, so long as it's not me. Next -
Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding? <+++++> My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off. <+++++> Man, you were a mess!
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this? <+++++> Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten? <+++++> This time...
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches. <+++++> Did your mother see angels often?
He hit you? <+++++> Naw. I bumped my head fallin' off of my horse.
I told them to kill you and they didn't. <+++++> Hard to get good help these days.
God, she's beautiful. My wiener's all tingly. <+++++> Shift to your left.
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV. <+++++> Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.
It's been a real pleasure, Eve. <+++++> I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
No one. <+++++> I don't have a girlfriend.
Nothin'. <+++++> What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus? <+++++> She could buy and sell you ten times over.
You say she killed a policeman? <+++++> Yes, from the West. He went undercover and and followed her here,
Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you? <+++++> No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
What? <+++++> It's so beautiful!
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water? <+++++> Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they -- <+++++> Then you've gotta ask him about that.
Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail? <+++++> I won't get away with it.
For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man? <+++++> Uh -- both?
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious... <+++++> Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate. <+++++> Well, let's see what we get.
Oh fuck. And we left the top down. You want to run for it? <+++++> Run for what?
Who is it? <+++++> Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again. Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs.
What's that? <+++++> I said -- not exactly -- no.
Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again. <+++++> Ah, well ... the company is better than last time. And the scenery has definitely improved.
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news. <+++++> I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people. <+++++> He's only doing what you told him to.
I have no idea what you're talking about. <+++++> The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
Yes! It's all written down in the notes. Tie off the kites and come down! <+++++> Yes, master. Just don't turn on any radios.
Uh, yes! <+++++> Yes?
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean? <+++++> Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?
She's not here. <+++++> Where is she?
Since Nancy died. <+++++> I'm sorry, that damn conference--
I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak. <+++++> Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a halo.
Vampira! You will come under my spell! You will be my slave of love. <+++++> Hey Bela, how do you do that?
...they say you're alright. <+++++> I'm fine.
You didn't mean to kill that policeman? <+++++> Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident.
Are they treating you okay? <+++++> I heard what happened. It looks like somebody murdered him.
No... it was a seven letter word. <+++++> Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
What about Bill? <+++++> He's in love with you.
Well, you stick to that story, son. <+++++> I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
I don't understand. <+++++> Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something? <+++++> Coffee might be nice.
Yeah... <+++++> Anyone else following?
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means. <+++++> I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
Oh. Then who's this one? <+++++> I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
I don't get it. <+++++> It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose.
They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from - <+++++> Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here?
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor -- <+++++> I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
It's like those Japanese in the Caves on Okinawa... didn't believe the War was Over. <+++++> You got a guy, doesn't believe the War is... NO NO NO.
Morning, officer. <+++++> Son. Little excitement out at the reservation this morning.
To my triumph, of course. <+++++> Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to. What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things. <+++++> Who?
I dunno. You know. I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that? <+++++> You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
That's gone long ago. I've got to see him. Where is he? <+++++> I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
Okay. Good. Goodbye. <+++++> Becky?
That what you got me up here for? <+++++> You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother. Come back, no hard Feelings.
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good. That's on their head. All I did I was put him there. <+++++> A typical fuck-up.
My therapist said that -- <+++++> You're in therapy?
You have? <+++++> Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl.
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say. <+++++> In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
Who the fuck knows? The Four Aces. He goes there. <+++++> Let's go.
Bojo called. Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle. <+++++> You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
Dad... I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise. <+++++> Don't worry about it. Right now money doesn't count. Okay?
Why do I always have to do it? <+++++> You're better at it.
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much? <+++++> Seventy-five per cent.
'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.' <+++++> Shit.
She knows I'm Catholic! She never mentioned divorce! Not once! <+++++> Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying. She was just long-term leasing' you. Ah, Nickie.
I believe you. <+++++> Thanks very much.
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is. <+++++> Then tell me how.
For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend. <+++++> You do?
It's the White House. <+++++> <u>Hello</u>. What?
Only the one in my pants. <+++++> Dude, I'm pregnant.
You see? We can't have anything to do with John. You and me will go down to the parlor. <+++++> Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
It's too late. I've already ruined my life. <+++++> You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you.
I ache with it. <+++++> Let me comfort you.
"To my honey I'll croon, <+++++> "He's gonna croon love's tune,
It's more like a mental block. When I'm with girls, it does nothing to me. <+++++> Have you tried?
Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused. <+++++> Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
Can I use the car tonight? <+++++> Of course, Jeffrey.
Restless. <+++++> Excuse me. 'Things are so confusing for me, Jack. Our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict- able.
I wouldn't bet against it. My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place. <+++++> Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal. Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.
Good afternoon. We have reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in Costa Blanca. <+++++> Yes, sir.
Heather? Wha... <+++++> Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing "Kumbaya" one more time...
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt. <+++++> Also known as Madman Mundt.
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children. <+++++> What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
 <+++++> You don't like his friends.
"Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me. <+++++> "At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..."
Yes, there is goes. <+++++> It's disappeared.
Don't. <+++++> Claire, I have to show up for the--
Got us in here, didn't I? <+++++> Shoulda got an apartment.
... yeah, that. <+++++> You never want to do that, see, that's always a... costly turnover. As they say in the sport biz.
Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write - <+++++> Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
The key! <+++++> Where is it? What did you do with it?
We're in no hurry. I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids. <+++++> Take your time. I wish I had.
I was at home, where were you? <+++++> At home.
What did it say? <+++++> A thousand things.
... We got to keep looking. Track him down! Great balls of fire! <+++++> What's the problem here?
MMMMMMMMMM! MMMMMMMMMMMM! <+++++> Wait! Stop! Don't give them the satisfaction. I know it's tough, but look at how far we've come!
Yes... yes, I... can hear you... <+++++> We're trying to get to you, sir...
As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack. <+++++> What about air strikes?
Well then - yes. Of course. <+++++> Thank you. Thank you.
What? <+++++> The booze.
What happened to title dictates behavior? <+++++> This is my way of spitting water at life.
I want my wife. I told you and told you. Now I'm gettin' tired of this shit-- <+++++> Omar, listen to me--
 <+++++> We're ticketed to fly back from Baltimore, anyway.
What are you talking about? <+++++> C'mon I'll show you.
Is he breathing? <+++++> I think so.
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks. <+++++> Yeah, well they may this one.
You sure about that? <+++++> Would you like to sell it?
...Please stop... <+++++> It's Madison Fra--
Then what? <+++++> Then what? That's it. That's all I got.
Vice... Jesus. <+++++> That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.
Tell me that was you. <+++++> Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
Are you going out somewhere? <+++++> No.
Wait here, I'll get you that martini. <+++++> Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
What? <+++++> Come with me. I'll tell you when we get there.
It was on my bed when I came in. Can you just...? <+++++> You sure?
I watched from behind the stands. Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know. "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing... <+++++> That's in the past. Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
A tragedy. But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident. <+++++> Two of them are still missing!
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich. <+++++> Craobhan-geanmchno...  How can I possibly say that with a straight face? !
So you can't tell me anything? <+++++> It's going to be a long winter.
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant. <+++++> I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind.
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma. <+++++> Then what difference does it make if we stop? Come on. I never get to do stuff like this.
Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much. your parents still live around here? <+++++> My mother's dead. Died in her sleep.

Honey. <+++++> GET OUT.
Hi. Sarah Knottingham. <+++++> You know her?
Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ... <+++++> ... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you. No sisters? No undiscovered twin?
Terry! You okay? <+++++> Help! Help!
Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends. And great DP's I could give them a call for you. <+++++> Thanks, Mac. And thanks for being so supportive about all this. I really love you, you know.
We're carrying weight. <+++++> We'll take your supercargo.
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail. You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire. <+++++> That's right.
Emily... <+++++> No. YouÂre looking at a real Musketeer here, Whitney. Brave and rash. Had to dash in there.
The obituary column? <+++++> You'll find one of those people.
So, Marty, let me tell you about these nurses... <+++++> What nurses?
I read your book. <+++++> Oh, yeah - - great.
Jesus. <+++++> Don't touch her. Call 911.
It's a comfortin' idea. <+++++> Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
Rain check me, partner. I got something big going on tonight. <+++++> What? That new mystery girl you've been seeing?

Forget about it. <+++++> I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
Now. <+++++> Let's go. I'll drive you. _ 45.
Oh. Well. Good. <+++++> Congratulations on the deal. How exciting. Is Sally doing Sally? I mean it's Sally. The character that's based on Sally.
You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries. <+++++> I set up Fisher with the broker that found his house. Took care of that one, didn't I? Prison Communications.
That one's probably married. Think of his kids. His wife's pregnant... <+++++> I'll deal with it. I will, I will...
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though. So who is this clown? <+++++> He ain't Spalding.
How do they know? <+++++> You told them, Hoffy.

What's the matter with you? <+++++> What's the matter with you?
Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom. <+++++> I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
They musta robbed fifty banks together. <+++++> Till they got busted.
Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay? <+++++> No.
When did she decide this? <+++++> Apparently just before her death.
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter? <+++++> I need you, tiger..
Why'd you do that? Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics... <+++++> It's no big deal.
God of passages and changes? <+++++> I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory. Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
 <+++++> HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!! !
Elaine. <+++++> Ted. I don't know why you got on this flight. I don't know what you're trying to prove.
We have time. <+++++> I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
Bisbee, Arizona. The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is. <+++++> When?
Would you like a closer look? <+++++> It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
That was a terrible thing. <+++++> I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.
... Four months. June to October. Mmmm...same the year before. <+++++> Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here. The plane's boarding. You're good at deadline. Here's your ticket. <+++++> It's amazing. You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking. Try and get this. When you edited that...
Ryan Taylor, first mate. Welcome aboard. First time in space? <+++++> Yes. Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
I'm taking up the situation with you now... <+++++> Susie, I want to help you--, there's nothing I won't do for you.
What's he in for? <+++++> He stole a tractor.
The Doctors were not negligent. <+++++> I... um...
Mr. President! Will the Senator yield? <+++++> Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Not me, buddy. <+++++> Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us.
That's right. When? <+++++> Would you like to come out tonight?
Some Italian I picked up back there. HeÂs in the boot of the Mustang. <+++++> Italian? The Mafia...?
Need to get in that building? <+++++> No really?
Hey! ! <+++++> She's sick!
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written. <+++++> To the best of my recollection, neither your name nor your performance entered the conversation.
Just say something cheerful. <+++++> Oh... right! Well... CHEERS everybody!
They should be passing through there about now... <+++++> Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
Gear? <+++++> Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
But -- <+++++> Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
Why would we do that? <+++++> I have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. Don't you?
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F. They need pilots, and we need experience. I leave tomorrow. <+++++> You waited til tonight to tell me?
Pow. <+++++> You got me.
But I sure don't like that she's leaving. <+++++> Well, that ain't fair to her. A single mother, that's a sacred thing, man. _ 103.
Maude, do you think you can help me? <+++++> What? With your skill and my experience... I think we can come up with something.
We're going to New York? <+++++> Yes. You're going to New York.
And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in. <+++++> He's not comin' in. Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
Now that's a really big house. <+++++> Jesus, look at that wall. Place almost looks like a prison.
You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him? <+++++> Well, what if?
Computer guy. <+++++> Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
Premier Belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie. <+++++> Mister President, are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this?
But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat. <+++++> I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
I'm concentrating. <+++++> We can't dive anymore. They want to cancel the competition for a while.
You look wonderful. <+++++> You always did. Can I give you a hand with that?
Hi. <+++++> Hey.
From now on you'll be history <+++++> You'll be hist...
The Dolphin was a symptom. <+++++> Of what?
You got no choice. It's over. <+++++> Fifty cars. Fifty cars by 8 AM Friday. Or Kip goes in that box.
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow? <+++++> Just one?
You're raggedy as a roach. You eat the holes out of donuts. <+++++> I'll be back on my feet. Soon enough.
The Bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. But chickens don't give milk. <+++++> Look, you want cheese, go someplace else.
Let it be rain, please let it be -- <+++++> Stay by the window. By the window.
Too complicated. <+++++> That's fine.
No. I love you. <+++++> I love you, too.
I'm sorry...? <+++++> Kenilworth.

Are you in show business? <+++++> I was a successful model once.
Den leuten. <+++++> Ja, ja, ja.
He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now. I'll prepare the body. <+++++> Oh! May I call you 'Master'?
Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot. <+++++> No kidding.
Then don't go to Hollywood. <+++++> Why?
He was a good man. <+++++> 
Good morning, Gaston. <+++++> Count d'Algout is still asleep.
Little. Very little. And skinny, very skinny too. That is compared to me. <+++++> I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
Why'd she run away? <+++++> Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out. <+++++> Don't give up on her. You're getting to the age when you ought to be thinking about these things.
You might be disappointed. <+++++> Why?
What? <+++++> I finish the walk, and then we may take all the chances we want.
Beverly Hills -- <+++++> What?
Captain who? <+++++> Captain Howdy.
No, don't let her! I'll... How about Peg? Robbie? <+++++> Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe. Oh... this is Stanley Davis.
I see your point. What's the favor? <+++++> Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
Hi, Dad. What happened? <+++++> What?
Yes? <+++++> Did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder?
Sabotage? <+++++> Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
Sure. They like to play. We may see some today. <+++++> Great!
He totally freaked. I've never seen him like this. He's out of his fucking mind. <+++++> That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.
What are you doing? <+++++> Counting the gray hairs in your head.
What? <+++++> When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz.
Max, what's a good men's shop in town? The very best... Well, go there ! <+++++> I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --
How is he? <+++++> Ten hours straight. He's a machine.
We're moving through time. <+++++> What?
It's a gig. <+++++> I mean, I need the money.
Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it! <+++++> Never... never... never!
I'll have to pack a lot of clothes. <+++++> Yeah...
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion. <+++++> Out of my way!
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next. That you might ask -- I'm not certain. <+++++> There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or...
Y-yes, Jim. <+++++> I doubt it! Come on, Ken.
Do you? <+++++> Yes.
Vada what about you, who have you come up with? <+++++> My mother.
Well, don't do that again! <+++++> How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'. <+++++> All right then.
Huh? <+++++> Grab Mary and come inside.
Tell me about your garden. <+++++> 
Who we got here...? <+++++> John Levy, Staff, and Amy Cain, Press Off....
This is a waste of time. <+++++> We're focusing.
 <+++++> I'm not much on rear window ethics.
I'll be up in five minutes. <+++++> Well -- goodbye then --
What? Why... <+++++> Beth --
That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane. <+++++> That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going. <+++++> Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
What's its value today? <+++++> In human life? In greed? In suffering?
Operator. <+++++> I need an exit! Fast!
I don't have to answer your questions. <+++++> No you don't: But I'm gonna ask you one more time: Are you alone in here?
It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it? <+++++> A medical miracle.
No, no, it's not. It's better. <+++++> Better?
 <+++++> That's because you're too far away, Stew.
I'm engaged for the evening. <+++++> Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
Routine, I assure you. I just wanted to gage my health. Am I healthy? <+++++> Yes -- you are.
Am I right or what? <+++++> You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
This. <+++++> This . . .
You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money. <+++++> Then he'll borrow it. I know Tony better than you do.
Hey. <+++++> What should I do?
...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile? <+++++> I'm sure I --
Hi, Lydia. <+++++> Is this a bad time?
You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire? <+++++> That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
Can't. History report. The Normans and the Saxons. <+++++> Bogutude. Blow it off.
She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her. <+++++> Yeah.
They're legal now. <+++++> They are?
Ohhh, I hate this. <+++++> Take your time. Don't worry about the elves. They won't come out here.
You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...? <+++++> At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.
You have to go. He'll never stop. Leave this place. Find another. <+++++> I'll go. We'll both go. Far away.
If we hesitate, all will be lost. <+++++> John . . .
Yes. Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood! Why are you staring at me like that? <+++++> Because there's an arrow in your leg.
First time on Mars? <+++++> Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.
What are we talking about? <+++++> Two guys?
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret. <+++++> When did you find out?
I... I don't know. I can't describe what I'm feeling. <+++++> You don't have to.
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things. <+++++> His lightsaber.
I'm... just looking for Parry... <+++++> He's not here.
He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves? <+++++> Ma! Please! You're driving me crazy.
Pearl dotes on him. <+++++> The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
I don't know, airport I guess. <+++++> They will have our description before we can get a plane.
.. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>? <+++++> He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it.
No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism. <+++++> Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers.
My father told me that. "Never cry wolf." Then people won't believe you if...something really happens. <+++++> "If something really happens"...like what, James?
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device? <+++++> Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
What is this, Rogoff? <+++++> I don't know yet.
Ha! Is the Pope Catholic? <+++++> I don't know.
I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing -- <+++++> Why did you do this?
Me? <+++++> Daphne has a beau - I have a beau - if we could only find somebody for you.
Tell me you didn't sign. Because I'm still sort of moved by your "my word is stronger'n oak" thing -- <+++++> We signed an hour ago. You were in the lobby with the black fella.
Could I lie to you and still see your beauty? <+++++> No.
You've got to put this on. <+++++> Take laddie.
There they are! <+++++> Okay, I'm slowing us down.
That's right. <+++++> So wait a minute.
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream? <+++++> Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
Why? <+++++> <u>I don't know why</u>!
I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind? <+++++> I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
I know. Jean-Pierre did. <+++++> You were behind the door?
No doubt. <+++++> You surprise me. Eliminating a rival like that. Such are the actions of a man of conquest. I was mistaken.
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland! <+++++> We can't... we keep our money there!
Hi Norm! <+++++> Hi, our lot!
No, sir. Not at all. <+++++> Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
A Wookiee broke loose up here, but we've subdued him... There is a lot of damage, and three, no four, casualties... <+++++> We'll send a squad up.
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here -- <+++++> But, buddy, you were --
Really? <+++++> In your dreams.
My mom wanted me to have this? <+++++> Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before-- <+++++> I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
I don't got the money. <+++++> Find the money.
What is this, some kind of joke? <+++++> No, it's five thousand dollars.
The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in? <+++++> We need more -
You're wasting your time. <+++++> Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...
Call 911, Mary, do it right now. <+++++> You fuckin' don't do that. You don't do it, you cocksucker. I'll fuckin' kill you with my barehands. Go.
Case... <+++++> Shhh...
We must obey our emperor and the Senate. <+++++> I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.
That's right, that's right. You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles. <+++++> That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
Thanks. <+++++> But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go? <+++++> To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want. <+++++> But I won't.
Oh, pretty good. <+++++> Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
I'm not nervous. <+++++> Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
If I didn't put it on somebody else would! I was his friend! <+++++> Don't give me that fucking shit.
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you. <+++++> You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
About what? <+++++> Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
One condition. <+++++> What?
Do not underestimate the power of your heart. Your dreams live there. <+++++> My dreams died long ago.
Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down. Are you catching on, Senator? <+++++> Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
Charming Schuvaloff. <+++++> Black-eyed Sczortarska.
What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ? <+++++> You saying you didn't ?
"</u> <+++++> Fuck you.
Why? <+++++> I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
I don't care. <+++++> Kids eat that kind of stuff in Korea.
YouÂre the one who got away. <+++++> Until now.
 <+++++> That so?
Can you play it? <+++++> Maybe...if you get here on time.
Four. <+++++> What's he like?
That must be it. <+++++> Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.
Now? <+++++> Yes, now.
Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid? <+++++> Fine, Dixie. Fine.
I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself. <+++++> Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
Home in on the strongest signal. Descend from orbit. <+++++> Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
George, where have you been? <+++++> What happened to your other slipper?
What can I do? I am only a boy. <+++++> You are the man who wrote this letter. You are the man who has come back to lead us. You will soon have great responsibilities.
What are you doing? <+++++> Lip reading.
 <+++++> Rachel, <u>don't</u> do this, you will <u>never</u> forgive yourself!
Yes sir. Right then it was. <+++++> A boy or girl?
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars. <+++++> A few bars!
Do machines ever play? <+++++> I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..." <+++++> I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know. <+++++> Do you know them? I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
I do, I have to be attractive to God. <+++++> He loves you the way you are.
Oh -- where do you come from? <+++++> Bastia -- and you?
What's wrong? <+++++> I forgot to lock the door.
Are you and Mom home tonight? <+++++> No. Why?
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble. <+++++> Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work. <+++++> Look, do you want the bed in or not?
I might. <+++++> Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger.
Yes. <+++++> I mean... "Ants." "I've got a problem with ants."
Wasting my time, naturally... Look at her teasing those bumpkins. <+++++> What does she see in them?
Yahoo! <+++++> Tomorrow, the acid test.
Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me. <+++++> "In the church when you need me." Was there ever a saint who hid in the Church?
If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel. I will kill both him and the man who told me. <+++++> Once a Musketeer, always a Musketeer, eh?
France. <+++++> How long is the voyage?
No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary? <+++++> I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary.
Sure. <+++++> I didn't know that.
No, thanks. <+++++> Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.
He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more. <+++++> But, they were there I counted 803 votes.
Hey!--you're tickling me. <+++++> Then we run our hands down a man's arms and legs-- like this--in case they got what you're looking for attached to a string.
Yeah, right -- whatever. <+++++> I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
Shame! <+++++> I'm not saying it's a bad thing, in fact, I think it's something we should take pride in.
Yeah? <+++++> I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television-
Oh. You mean -- like a girl-friend? <+++++> No. Like a man.
Is this upsetting you? <+++++> I've seen worse.
This is what they call the jack. Hi, Jack! <+++++> Laughs.
Too old, dull fighter. Bobby Judge is a good boy. <+++++> ...I don't feel heat from the name.
When? <+++++> You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
Nothing R, okay? <+++++> Enough for drinks, popcorn and candy!
Did she make any sound? Didn't scream? <+++++> I don't know.
It's so small. <+++++> What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
You're not gonna win. <+++++> And you have to smile.
Any girl? Okay. Let's start with that one. <+++++> Oh yes, she's very nice.
So? <+++++> I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
So I'm a little jumpy. Who wouldn't be? <+++++> You're certifiable.
I'd want to know just about everything about them. <+++++> Exactly. Now I'm the killer. And there's something I don't want you to know.
You got these cops outta here. They're comin' in too close. <+++++> Come on. I want you to see something.
Sometimes you do. <+++++> Freddie was so happy for me when I got this job.
I want to know everything about you. <+++++> You do. And once I'm out of here, I'll remind you of the best parts.
Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well. <+++++> Who brings it?
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding. <+++++> Please, it really doesn't matter.
Then he must have pulled her. <+++++> Expect so.
Me, too. <+++++> God, I don't get it. Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?
That's not true, Mr...? <+++++> Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
Now calm down Walter! Now, let's go in there, and when the show's over, maybe we can talk about it. <+++++> No! I want to talk about it now!
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for? <+++++> He's only just dead. What was I supposed to do with him? I can't take him away anywhere.
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost. <+++++> Is he here in Borderdale?
Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar. <+++++> The Feds would be onto you in a month.
What the heck d'ya mean? <+++++> Three people. In Brainerd.
You've been doing some research in the archives. <+++++> I want to know what my child is going to face.
Cal, my wife Judy. <+++++> Nice to meet you.
Say, aren't you that actor guy? <+++++> Yeah.
I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that? <+++++> You got me mad, that's why. Hey, Joe, show Marty that picture.
Just a girl. <+++++> And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Are you Chip Sutphin? <+++++> Hold on...  Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
How many of these you gonna eat, huh? <+++++> Two.
Doesn't the isolation bother you? <+++++> Yeah, but I like the sun. I grew up on a reservation. The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.
Marlon-- <+++++> --Truman, what are you doing here?
Are you saying they won't help us? <+++++> I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning? <+++++> I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
Ben where do you have to get to? <+++++> Heaven. I have to tell him he's made a mistake. He should take Grammy Martha first. Or Grandpa Norman.
You bet I do, sir. <+++++> But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions! I want ten million and one. <+++++> Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
 <+++++> Sorry.
What? <+++++> This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
What am I supposed to think? <+++++> Honey, about what?
From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts. <+++++> I only wonder if this man has the skill to go past three rounds -- Vegas odds say, 'no.'
And you knew he'd be here. <+++++> Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
Come on, we're going to get your coat. <+++++> Take your hands off me!
Yeah, what? <+++++> Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil. <+++++> Good or evil, what's the difference?
It might be for me. <+++++> I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
You want to take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is-- <+++++> Damn. Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.
Yes, sir. <+++++> You have a Lieutenant here...
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago. <+++++> So what did you find.
Time. <+++++> What the hell are you talking about?
Oh. <+++++> Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.
You're all through with this now? <+++++> Yes sir. I sure am.
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once. <+++++> So now you suddenly care about my future?
Don't say that, it's not good for you. You're... <+++++> You're right.
Because I never have. That's why you go places, isn't it? <+++++> Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.
--mine's better-- <+++++> --no way--
Get the fuck outta here already. <+++++> I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held! <+++++> He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing!
One-two-three, swing. <+++++> Thanks. May I offer you both a ride?
The ones you built? <+++++> They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow.
Is jumped on by one. Upham FIRES. KILLS the German. <+++++> Struggling with a pair of Germans.
What do you mean what are we going to do? <+++++> I mean -- Earl grabs Booth's arm --
A bomb. At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears. <+++++> Does he have to go?
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there... <+++++> I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough. <+++++> Look at that.
Heavens, look at that now! <+++++> I've seen it.
It must be this one. <+++++> Just give me the keys.
All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer and RKO. I've heard it from everyone-- <+++++> But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?!
Who said Sidney? <+++++> I said Sidney!...
As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far? <+++++> Every word.
Are you okay? <+++++> I think so.
And the year before that? <+++++> "U.S.A. is A-okay."
Uh huh. <+++++> You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?
I'm sending. Do you hear me? <+++++> Receiving.
When were the Sacred Scrolls written? <+++++> Twelve hundred years ago.
Dios mia. <+++++> I tol' him. I tol' him this is a dead place. Like all the others.
She pleases me. Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes. <+++++> Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
Yeah? <+++++> Oh, you know what? I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes. <+++++> Oh. We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
Sunlight, you say? <+++++> Aye. Hurry now, Gump, the key!
Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone? <+++++> I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.
Who told you to step on my sneakers? Who told you to walk on my side of the block? Who told you to be in my neighborhood? <+++++> I own a brownstone on this block.
One of the ways is not giving up. I'm telling ya! <+++++> Would you do something for me? Please?
What? <+++++> I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
That's the point, isn't it? <+++++> Yeah, I get it. Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan. <+++++> But -- why?
It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives. <+++++> A factor of age.
What do you do, if I may be so bold? <+++++> I'm just an accountant.
I've had a gutful of this. <+++++> If you want to stay you'll have to exercise a little self-control, and be a bit more humble to everybody.
Why isn't she with you? <+++++> Why? Because she would never show up at something like this. She's intensely private.
I want to experience childbirth. <+++++> With a, with a stranger? With a--
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why canÂt you go back there? <+++++> The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
We've blown the computer! Elaine! Set course change! <+++++> Set!
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are. <+++++> Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
What? <+++++> You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
I understand. How often do you see your son? <+++++> Often, uh.
That's right. <+++++> Complicated or not, life moves on. Hm?
How long will we have to stay down here? <+++++> I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture. <+++++> What for?
And the rule was... <+++++> Never to pretend to know more than I did.
Not no more. <+++++> What are you talking about?
He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control .. <+++++> Point is, listen to them. They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.
Lost. <+++++> Someday, Dick.
Christ, Jake, please-- <+++++> Is that what happened? Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?
I speak to you on ze phone, non? You have a special interest in music? <+++++> Uh-huh.
Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman? <+++++> A woman.
What happened? What's Earl doing here? <+++++> He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
How's it going with Gail? <+++++> No joy yet.
What are you bitching about now? <+++++> What are you doing here?
Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train? <+++++> Oh, darling!
You don't have an appointment, do you? <+++++> W... We didn't know how to make one.
 <+++++> We'd never make it past the raptors. Trust me, I have some experience in this matter.
Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in? <+++++> Because I want someone I can trust.
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change. <+++++> Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was.
Yeah. <+++++> They called here after you left...
No, I didn't know that. <+++++> We learn something new about ourselves every day. Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear.
HUH? <+++++> I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben.
Nice to meet you, Stacy. <+++++> Nice to meet you.
You're a good man, Hardy. <+++++> Really.
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day? <+++++> What?
George, what are you going to do? <+++++> I'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is.
We've got no option. We're gonna have to get it off. <+++++> Oh man...
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! <+++++> You can do it in my mouth.
It's fine. <+++++> You haven't looked at the dossier.
What kind of Treasury Dept. business is this? <+++++> Undercover.
That's not Fred Madison? <+++++> No, sir, it's not.
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it! <+++++> Where is he now?
Thanks. <+++++> I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
I'm going to take a bus to my sister's. I thought I'd stay with her for a few days. <+++++> Is that right? Can't say as I blame you for wanting to head out for a bit.
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- . <+++++> How long?
He didn't kill her. <+++++> How do you know?
How did she pay you? <+++++> What?
You, I would've noticed. <+++++> Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend.
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization. <+++++> The Corleone Family, Senator. We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
Would you like me to go for her? <+++++> I couldn't ask you to.
Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ... <+++++> Just listen to me ...
That would be okay. <+++++> Just a little way.
Goddamnit. <+++++> They just said they wanted time.
I don't understand...what does he want? <+++++> He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.
One man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. You just pay him a wage and take *all* the crop. <+++++> But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now.
That's not fair. <+++++> Why can't we be together?
 <+++++> Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
Santini will do that for 25 dollars! <+++++> Then tell him to wax it too.
Last night's letter was. The evidence supports only one conclusion: there has been a coup, and Khruschev was replaced overnight. <+++++> Jesus Christ...
I planned on catching him, Captain. <+++++> How? You don't know the place. You don't know the language. Get on the plane.
Things have been so serious here lately. <+++++> Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real.
She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her? <+++++> *You* taught her, I suppose...
I'll help you...! <+++++> I won't.
Is he black? <+++++> He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.
Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast. <+++++> Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
Been to the Boat Show. <+++++> Packs a punch, but it's compact, has accessible features -- makes a nice concealed-carry piece.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho. <+++++> It's a short word.
Looks like we came a long way for nothing. <+++++> Oh -- and I was so happy! I thought I was on my way home!
You killed two men, Ben Harper. <+++++> That's right, Preacher.
Stay there. <+++++> I don't want you within two hundred feet. Park down by the lifeguard station. Nobody gets out.
I have no extraordinary powers. <+++++> Your powers are greater than you know. Have you ever seen one of these?
It is Victor. <+++++> Call an ambulance.
If I don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me. <+++++> Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells.
Urgh. <+++++> Take me, darling! Tame your little monkey of love!
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas? <+++++> Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
Ah. <+++++> His I know. Yours I don't have a clue.
Karen...  ... you won't forget, will you? What we talked about before? <+++++> No, Eve, I won't forget...
Don't con me. Don't try... <+++++> Okay, okay.
Uh oh, it's Nancy. She wants another load of firewood. <+++++> Forget it, man. It's not worth it.
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it. <+++++> There, Mr. Webster. All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
Go on. <+++++> Would you hurry up, please?
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered? <+++++> Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant.
Who? <+++++> The Cenobites.
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour. <+++++> Just sandwiches...
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool... <+++++> Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'...
You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ? <+++++> Sure, man --
Three minutes. It couldn't have been over three minutes, the Secret Service... <+++++> Okay. And she's alleging...?
Yeah, all right, listen... <+++++> So when she wanted a divorce...I was...I didn't know what I'd done wrong. I didn't see it.
All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro. <+++++> And you never got the chance?
Can you do that? <+++++> Yeah, sure. Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
I need you to teach me. <+++++> Gimme a break. One shrimp and fries to go! Anything to drink?
Finished what? <+++++> Learning language.
Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet. <+++++> Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir.
Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something! <+++++> David, don't lose control.
What? <+++++> You've got to talk to them before they tear the theater apart!
I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though. You don't touch yourself, do you? <+++++> What do you mean?
What? <+++++> Jesus!
Do you imply that I'm a queer? <+++++> God, no.
If we could scare up some men to play. <+++++> We could come to my room.
He's not drunk, he's crazy. <+++++> Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
They won't kill it.... <+++++> We'll divert it...We'll do something....
Hardly. <+++++> Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage.
Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon. <+++++> Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
He says he loves me. <+++++> Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love.
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle. <+++++> A miracle. Well, that's news.
Why was the maid crying? <+++++> I'm not sure I can make you understand. You know what this is?
Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field. <+++++> And it is my pleasure to be here.
WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD! <+++++> It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
Would you come in here, please? <+++++> And let's put this together. Okay? Shel? Say okay.
Right... Knickers... Cabbages... It doesn't have a beak. Alex laughs. Slide of woman speaking to boy. <+++++> Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
No. <+++++> No!
He checks too. <+++++> That leaves two strangers.
What if he's not? <+++++> Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him. He was going to kill you. He was one blink away from it.
I care for her. <+++++> I don't want to see her hurt.
Self sufficient... <+++++> With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
Take a message. <+++++> It's alright. I'll get it.
Thanks <+++++> Give it back Nicholas!
That's what I said. <+++++> Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.
Personally, I'd prefer stupidity. <+++++> Pride will do.
What you want there? Somebody invite you in? <+++++> That's Baby's kin. I don't need no invite to look after her people.
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one. <+++++> The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
I have to. <+++++> When can I see, you again ?
I don't need to compound the problem with women. Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life? Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with -- <+++++> I wanted the choice. The chance to prove myself, my skills, my work, me. That's how it should've been.
We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt! <+++++> You fool!
Lady Van Tassel. <+++++> What was she doing?
I've been thinking I could try to visit you at night after work, and then there'd be more time on weekends to see... <+++++> Letty, please.
George, could you -- excuse us for a minute? <+++++> Sure.
Caesar, what happened? <+++++> It was unbelievable! Un-fucking- believable!
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day. I'll call you about his next week. <+++++> I won't be here next week. The tumor's inoperable. I'll be dead.
Whaddya been so far? <+++++> Eddie, you're a born loser.
Fine with me. <+++++> I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me. We'll die in peace.
And pointless. <+++++> I see. Well, even if you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --
Are you out of your mind? ! <+++++> I was just trying to make a point. If --
What ... What ... ? <+++++> What did you see? The same as I. Appetite sated. Desire indulged. You saw the working of the world in miniature.
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened. <+++++> I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me!
More proof God's a guy... <+++++> ...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
I think you're exaggerating. And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job. <+++++> Oh yes?
Whatever suggested the idea to you? <+++++> 
And bring the cocktail shaker. <+++++> Oh, Sugar. You're going to spoil my surprise.
It takes time to process -- <+++++> No, no, no, no, nO, NO, NO!
Seriously? I'm doing all right? <+++++> You're taking this bull of an empire by the horns, but you're still keeping your small town values.
Herman. <+++++> So ain't this just the bee's knees? The high muckey-mucks dolled up all Aztec-like for the human sacrifice.
No I need to call you. Just you. <+++++> I'm sorry, your voice.
No. <+++++> Well who did?
Nothing. Can I open my eyes? <+++++> No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
Fifty yards and closing. <+++++> What do we use for defense?
I don't know. I felt like it. I never saw anyone get done before. <+++++> You enjoy it?
The prom? Kat has a date? <+++++> No, but
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would. Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue? <+++++> Get the fuck away from me.
Good Morning, hon. Your breakfast is ready. <+++++> What time is it?
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong? <+++++> No, no. I'm on my way to my audition.
Yes? <+++++> Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line. How are you?
I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow. <+++++> I need two hundred and fifty grand.
Where was that? <+++++> Walker and Williams.
What're you talking about? <+++++> Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
But why would she -- ? <+++++> She's lying, Norman. Just like she lied about fixing your suit.
Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I? <+++++> Go. I command you.
Yes. <+++++> Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain.
How could I ruin myself? What do you mean, ruin myself? <+++++> I don't know. Excessive masturbation?
'My father's house has many mansions.' <+++++> Very smooth. It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.
I'll take you back to the hotel. <+++++> You know what the difference Is between hitting .250 and hitting .300? 1 got it figured out.
He said something about a girl -- <+++++> Holster your guns!
Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker. <+++++> It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I? <+++++> I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information? <+++++> Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this? <+++++> You're strong enough. But you're going to need courage, Willow.
You have no idea what I'm talking about. <+++++> Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
Stuff? <+++++> He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things. And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings? <+++++> Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country.
Eight-thirty. <+++++> Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called. <+++++> He did? When?
There's an empty taxi across the street. If you're so anxious, take it. He'll know the way to the police headquarters. <+++++> You do things the hard way, don't you?
I thought you hated this place? <+++++> I do. I just said that. I was never here before. I actually like it.
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about. <+++++> I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Just my luck, no ice. <+++++> I take it you've heard.
That's right? <+++++> I've never met anyone like you in my life.
Who's they? <+++++> Everybody.
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come. <+++++> You lie.
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up. <+++++> What I mean is --
Listen, Danny, you can't just barge in and -- <+++++> Shut up...
Well hello, Sherm. <+++++> You wanted to talk?
Hey Butt-Head, do you think we're ever gonna score? <+++++> Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
Like hell it's over. You told me he wasn't doing this anymore. <+++++> He's not, he's...
You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final. <+++++> Yeah, luckily.
Well, how was it? <+++++> Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
 <+++++> He has already agreed to come.
Well, then I'm quitting. <+++++> Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you.
No. <+++++> What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
It does not come off as easily as the young ones. <+++++> Perhaps -- but it comes off none the less.
Do as I say. Let go! <+++++> Oh, God! I'm going to die!
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time? <+++++> Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
I didn't know her. <+++++> And nobody else saw her in the water?
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there. <+++++> Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
What took so long? <+++++> She couldn't decide.
Upper West Side. <+++++> Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy. <+++++> You still got plenty energy for me, baby.
You couldn't believe it? Vince the Prince? <+++++> I never said he was an altar boy, okay? But he sent his goons after me! They tried to kill me! I'm not kidding!
I bought it in a pawn shop. <+++++> Don't lie to me.
Will I go crazy or something? <+++++> No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth.
Ah. Yes, of course ... um ... err ... <+++++> Does wood sink in water?
Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like? <+++++> It doesn't look all that different.
If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared? <+++++> I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know. <+++++> Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
It's bad isn't it? <+++++> We should get you to the doctor.
And your worst enemy. <+++++> Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy. I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent. <+++++> Why?
I've got to work... <+++++> Do you want me to go...?
So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret? <+++++> You like me. How come?
I'll put the, in your r... <+++++> Somebody make a note. I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like? Lilacs. Okay.
Yeah, kinda, wanted to see if you'd join back up with us. <+++++> That what you got me up here for?
Let her go. She didn't kill anybody. <+++++> I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me. <+++++> I'm helpin' you, huh?
Of course. <+++++> Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular.
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that! <+++++> So why are you talking to him?
Thirty-seven! <+++++> Shut up! Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not happy about it, but I've been able to deal.
It's a poison arrow tree frog. <+++++> Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
You worked out well. <+++++> You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind.
...yeah... <+++++> To not do that. To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
What about it? <+++++> Down there you buy a life, up here you earn it or die. How's your health?
Yes. <+++++> You haven't told bedtime stories before?
No... <+++++> Good. For a second there I thought we were in trouble.
Can't live without trouble, can you? Nice place you got here. Real nice. <+++++> Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
Listen to me. Hear the words. <+++++> This is madness!
A small, "calico" kitten, sir. "Calico." <+++++> ...can we have a white one...?
Uh, sure. I hear you. <+++++> So be here at three.
You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was. <+++++> I knew where it was.
They're putting me on film tomorrow. <+++++> Fine.
You mean it's heisted. <+++++> You could say that.
Bad news is, word's spreading like wildfire that we don't have badges, and nobody wants to end up getting splattered like Butch Cassidy either. <+++++> If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
Hello. <+++++> Who is this?
I had nothing to do with that. Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing? <+++++> Yes, you approved it, sir.
You'll find enough Cong up there. <+++++> What about this point here?
Yes. <+++++> Why, then, things should be fine.
Fine, sir, fine. <+++++> Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.
No back-up. <+++++> You're not following procedure.
Dewey, there's no such place. <+++++> Humor me, Sid.
Did you have sex with her? <+++++> What?
Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell... <+++++> The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
Come on, let's give it a dry run. <+++++> Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
I don't believe it. <+++++> It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
Two... <+++++> Irwin...
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars. <+++++> You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
They were over here, Professor. <+++++> Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up. <+++++> Really?
Huh? <+++++> Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
That is why we ask you to submit to the Church Militant... that is to say, us. <+++++> So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good Christian?
All night? <+++++> Yeah.
I told you what I want. Lock the door! <+++++> James, why don't we...?
Can't you take a guess? <+++++> Well...not for another two hours.
Wh-wh-whooo? <+++++> Bones.
Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land. <+++++> What about the law?
What are you doing? <+++++> Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
She's just not the girl for me. <+++++> She's only perfect.
Your hair looks the same. <+++++> It was just a trim.
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives. <+++++> Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
Let the girl go. <+++++> Why?
Do you know what "normal" is? <+++++> I suppose it's however society defines it.
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson? <+++++> Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese.
Everything is double the price now, you do understand that? <+++++> I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
Goodnight, Benjamin. <+++++> Well, wait.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer. <+++++> There ya go.
Yes. <+++++> I want you to stop seeing her.
I can't open it. <+++++> It's just me. I want to talk to you. Let me in...
I need a receipt. Sign your name across the flap. <+++++> Open it and count it.
Maybe I don't want you to. <+++++> Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
Hurry up -- the salad's getting warm and the pasta's getting cold. <+++++> -- I've got to study.
I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation? <+++++> One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it.
A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?" <+++++> Wow... Stop giving them away. I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
Is that... one person? <+++++> Here's her picture...
I want to see Swann face to face. <+++++> Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name? <+++++> What's the dif --
You'll wait in the hall? <+++++> I'll wait there.
No. <+++++> Oh -- I forgot. The track star doesn't smoke.
Jean? Hello? Jean? <+++++> Patrick? Is that you?
Gosh! Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll-- <+++++> Good as new! It's quite all right--
Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber! <+++++> Why did you betray me? Paris was ours for the taking!
Yes, I am. There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor. Why don't you go down and read some magazines? <+++++> You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?
That's all you cared about. I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two. <+++++> You had your coaches and your father for that stuff. It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
By your Austrian? <+++++> Yeah.
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you. <+++++> I didn't mean for it to turn out like this. Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter.
If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before -- <+++++> Aramis! I have been expecting you! We are satisfied, that will do.
That's me. <+++++> I'm glad you came.
 <+++++> 
Maude, I must speak to you. <+++++> What is it, Harold?
Just dull. <+++++> Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
But the work -- <+++++> 'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had. <+++++> He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light. <+++++> I can't believe we built this.
We can't expect to understand a life form like this. We're out of our back yard. Things are different here. <+++++> Well, can't we kill it? I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her? <+++++> No.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here. <+++++> Sir, how about souvenirs?
You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch. <+++++> Really?
And of course I accept. I'm flattered. And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time. <+++++> Yes. And you will give General Cushman full access.
If anyone is back here I want you to come out and I want you to show yourself to me with your hands in the air -- <+++++> THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN BEDROOM.
Jeanne -- be careful -- you're not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment... <+++++> And you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!
I was <u>slumming it</u>! I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place! <+++++> Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil? <+++++> No. Don't bother.
Bernie -- this is Anna. <+++++> Hello, Anna. Delighted to meet you.
But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too. <+++++> Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
Mrs.  Ansel's clothing. <+++++> Does it fit?
Well, you can... <+++++> Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o. 'd.
Okay. But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad. <+++++> Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail! <+++++> I'd put you there myself.
And this is my son, Paul. He was only four years old when his father disappeared. <+++++> He's coming back, Mom! He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
Where's he at? <+++++> I don't know.
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer. <+++++> I have thought about you.
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore. <+++++> Something modest but clean -- and near enough to UNESCO so you can take a cab when it rains -- okay?
Why, man? <+++++> I don't have to listen to this.
You know where he's taking her? <+++++> Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
Don't talk about my wife. <+++++> I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say!
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door. <+++++> Yeah, okay.
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else. <+++++> I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
Frank? <+++++> You want to see him too, right?
She's gutty. <+++++> She's nuts.
The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres. <+++++> I led no massacres.
And I keep my mouth shut? <+++++> That's what I want.
Why not? <+++++> Just don't... I've got a headache.
Why did Mikey leave Nazca? <+++++> And what's this ... ?
Proud? I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things. <+++++> As long as that's your only problem you're...
We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point. <+++++> You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Yes? <+++++> -- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
Too busy playin' ball, huh? <+++++> Nah, I gave it up.
I'm fine. Yes. I'm fine. <+++++> Ready to go,go,go?
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later. <+++++> I'd like to stay.
I'm just nervous. Sorry. <+++++> You're safe. He wouldn't come here.
But what if we can't ever find where we came from? ! <+++++> Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do.
When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how. <+++++> Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks? <+++++> I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
Yeah, okay... whatever. <+++++> Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.
See something you like, my man? <+++++> Yes. I would like my flask back.
Anything... may I sit down? <+++++> Yes.

I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school? <+++++> No.
Maybe you can do it and maybe you can't, Mr. Kane. <+++++> Charles!
Good. So did I. <+++++> Okay. See you around.
Maybe. <+++++> It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career.
I'll have a cup of coffee? <+++++> Never use it. Stuff'll kill ya.
...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone. It's considered offensive. <+++++> You know so much about the Middle East, you know where we can get something to eat.
Yes... <+++++> But, but but but...
You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken? <+++++> Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
What is it? <+++++> That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf. <+++++> Oh you do, do you?
In some situations. <+++++> 
... What? <+++++> Just don't call him, Alan!
You slept with her! <+++++> You should have kill him when you had the chance. But no...
Tch, oh. I always told you you would leave me. But...does it have to be now? <+++++> Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
Oh yeah? How's he doing? <+++++> He's going to be a fireman.
No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure. <+++++> You sure?
The question is irrelevant. <+++++> Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them.
I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here? <+++++> Where?
No, please, I don't -- <+++++> It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up. Take the damn gun.
They said she was just rags, like somebody - <+++++> Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?
Is this with a girl named Kristen? <+++++> Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
 <+++++> A couple days; that's all I'm askin'. I can stay clear that long.
Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow. <+++++> Do they have to look so...robotic?
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself. <+++++> What! You can't be --
Ah. <+++++> After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma.
My name is Lenore Oberfeld. <+++++> Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
Most important...I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life. <+++++> What guarantees can I give you? I am the hunted one. I've missed my chance.
Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss. <+++++> Does that bother you, Bill? I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
The chauffeur. He's watching. <+++++> He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
Bar across the street. <+++++> Have you called Betty? Maybe you should.
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance! <+++++> Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty? Do you enjoy it? All that blood and noise and pain?
What happened? ! <+++++> Isn't it wonderful? After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
You're sure? Any more nightmares? <+++++> No.
Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations. <+++++> Yes.
You know, I never got your name. <+++++> Miss Itsu. In here, please.
Chipped? The door? How can it be chipped? <+++++> I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
That's all right. There is nothing anyone can do about it. You can call me Luke. <+++++> Thank you, sir. I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
I swear to God, that was not here two days ago... <+++++> What is it?
Did you ever report it to anyone? <+++++> Heavens, no! The owners don't like us to even talk about it. I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
You... you got to want this: armored car job. CalTrust Bank. They took two million in cash... <+++++> Read my lips: Zimmermann or nothing.
There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain. <+++++> Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
What is it? <+++++> I'm the last. Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!
I wanted him to see me. <+++++> Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something.
In the room? <+++++> In the world.
Oh, why are you making those faces? <+++++> I can't hear you. I can't hear anything.
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here! <+++++> Her legs are in the way.
And then I lost him. In the fog. <+++++> About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
We were here two Christmases ago. <+++++> Well, that's a long time.
Carl -- <+++++> Goodbye Arnie.
Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator. We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention. <+++++> If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it. Just one thing:  Why Vega?
So why are you talking to him? <+++++> I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
What do we have here, Margaret? <+++++> It's a tampon in a teacup...
Jesus. Small world. Where's the photographer? <+++++> No one available.
"The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men." <+++++> Twenty? !
Just one question. Please. <+++++> He. Can't. Answer.
Gee, your Dad's smart. <+++++> I know.
I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention. <+++++> No, I wasn't.
No. <+++++> I mean if you knew karate?
Nurse. <+++++> Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for. <+++++> Faith, I've seen it already, okay?
... as have all attempts at internal analysis. We've tried sonargrams, magnetic resonance, gamma rays; it's completely impenetrable. <+++++> Recommendations?
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space. <+++++> 
The stewardess. Do you know her last name? <+++++> Brown, Jackie Brown.
She said awfully sorry, make yourself comfortable, she won't be long. . <+++++> Thanks.
I was upset. <+++++> I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.
That's what you get flight pay for. <+++++> Maybe I shouldn't take it.
Don't tell me...merchant banking? <+++++> No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean... <+++++> Yeah? Me too...
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille. <+++++> You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch? O.K. Here we go.
It's all taken care of. It's all paid for. <+++++> I'm used to paying my own bills.
Well look at that. <+++++> I told you. You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
She was lonely, I talked to her. Norman, I know how it looks, but-- <+++++> Claire, listen to me. I know you're under some strain. But there's no such thing as ghosts. They don't exist.
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl? <+++++> Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest. <+++++> Hey , Hey !
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun! <+++++> No.
You have the WORST flu since... <+++++> I have cancer. Do you know what that is?
OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby. <+++++> Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby.
Do I look like a narc? <+++++> Yeah.
I had three other offers. I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty. <+++++> Then show some. They'll shut me down!
Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers! <+++++> Oh, a *boy*!
Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better. <+++++> But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something...
We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck... <+++++> Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
What did you say your name was? <+++++> Green.
I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine. <+++++> Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years.
What is it like to fly on a plane, sir? <+++++> It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
Yes! When I give the word -- throw the first switch! <+++++> You've got it, master.
I'11 take my chances then. I'11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars. <+++++> Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
Thirty-two. <+++++> Get out!
Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help. <+++++> Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
That's your expert opinion? <+++++> Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.
Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask? <+++++> I used to be married to one.
Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember? <+++++> Don't remind me.
Shush. It's only been a day. And it's seemed like forever. <+++++> Tonight then.
You must believe me. <+++++> What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!
Do you hear anything? <+++++> Only silence. It's always like this.
Mr. Mitchell. <+++++> A little something on account perhaps?
Where they taking us, anyway? <+++++> Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though. <+++++> Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
These are private -- these are for us. <+++++> I know.
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab. <+++++> Where is it?
Look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do I have to -- <+++++> Please continue...
Right around here, in the food court. <+++++> Sit down, leave the bag under the table?
And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king? <+++++> I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
You have no right to say such things! <+++++> - and artistically, the most promising! Eve dear, this is Addison.
May I sit down? <+++++> Of course.
It was nice to see you again, to see your face again, to go out with you -- <+++++> I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
Hello? <+++++> Jim, it's Lowell.
And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you. <+++++> Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them. <+++++> Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy. You're cool.
Just come with me! <+++++> Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.
Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here-- <+++++> --but you're father's in there!
I needed a place to hide. I'm in trouble, Eddie. <+++++> So I hear. Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
What's so exciting? <+++++> It's not too far away now.
You don't want much, do you? <+++++> Can you do it or not?
Strange, isn't it? You know -- how it would have a button. <+++++> Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
That's funny, Mr. Whale. <+++++> It is, isn't it? My life as a game of strip poker. Shall we play?
I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed. <+++++> Catherine, I want you come live in my house with Marty and me.
Who's your Daddy! <+++++> Who's your Daddy!
Do you think I did it? <+++++> No.
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere... <+++++> Is there anything in there that can blow? We have to be ready for any contingency--
I NEED SOME <+++++> YOUNG BLOOD
There! Happy? I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise. Now look what you've done! <+++++> This isn't possible...
That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard. Wait, I know this... A votre sante. <+++++> A la votre.
Yes it is. <+++++> Marge, good morning. Unusual weather.
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends. <+++++> You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'?
Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again! <+++++> Ed --
Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ... <+++++> Okay--that's enough!
Daddy, don't start with this again. <+++++> Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells.
What's the Boom Boom Room? <+++++> That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.
The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have one of them testify. <+++++> Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it.
Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother! <+++++> That's why we're only breaking one arm.
Did you do it that night? <+++++> He never came home.
Why didn't you tell me you were going to write it in Greek? I'd start a new department. <+++++> That was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York. <+++++> Harry.
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled. <+++++> I joined the Navy.
He's still got a good grip. We need to dig more. <+++++> At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.
I think you're a louse. <+++++> I am. Good day. Madam.
The troops are certainly moving in here! <+++++> Didn't you have something to do with this? I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
It's over, Dick. <+++++> I'll concede in the morning.
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal. <+++++> Hear what?
Ronnie... Yeah, so. <+++++> Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
You're not a stalker or anything, right? <+++++> Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
[The ransom was ten.] <+++++> [Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
What about running number two by itself? <+++++> It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
And what about your own hand? <+++++> No problem. A pair of deuces? Less? So what? I bluff.
I like my name. <+++++> This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit. We used to be married.
No, Carter. I can't take this. <+++++> It's okay, I got lots more.
...Hi. <+++++> Does it get any better or what!
I desecrated it? <+++++> You forced an innocent man to run like an animal.
You tell me. <+++++> No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it.
For me. <+++++> For you...
Sorta literally gets ahead of himself. <+++++> Hang on. -- And this is the good part; when you're fully ordained, he'll come when you call him, too. Dave.
I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas. <+++++> Huh?
I saw what I saw. <+++++> Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky. <+++++> 
<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart. <+++++> Message to Proteus.
Do we know anything about him? <+++++> Ahm - he's male. He's English. He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.
I cut myself shaving. <+++++> You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
It looks new, they might miss one or two. <+++++> We're going to need it all.
 <+++++> Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
And--? <+++++> And I love poetry above all.
Why don't we go home? <+++++> Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
Yeah. [Beat] How about you? <+++++> Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though.
If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago. A girl no one even remembers. <+++++> Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name. Her mom remembers her.
A month? Half a year? Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time... <+++++> Narcissus!
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon. <+++++> Count d'Algout...
...Glad you came man. <+++++> Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house? <+++++> Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh. <+++++> And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops. That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks. <+++++> Oh Jesus...
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits. <+++++> Well, that was Adrian's idea. I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . .
So we were going to wait till she went to Europe. <+++++> What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
Oh, shit. I hate looking at that! <+++++> Don't want to film this?
A marker's like a check, Harry. <+++++> I know what a marker is.
Sonofabitch! <+++++> Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.
You did say birds? <+++++> Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
I'm kind of busy right now... <+++++> I'm going to kill Jason Voorhees -- and I need you to help me.
"What we want is in that room." <+++++> They're coming in here, aren't they?
No Debbie! That ain't what happened! They been lyin' to you... <+++++> You lie! All white men lie...and kill...
Hello, Charlie. Long time no see. <+++++> What is it, Spats? What do you want here?
No. <+++++> A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
I'm kind of busy, Norma. <+++++> You're not busy, sweetheart, now go.
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here! <+++++> Perfect! That's the way it shall be!... <U>Give me Genesis</U>!
No! <+++++> Letitia.
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine. <+++++> Reed? ... Sue?
You're lower than a dog! <+++++> Fuck you!
Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information? <+++++> Harry, lemme give you some advice.
Laz... You can't say nothin'... <+++++> If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...
Man? <+++++> Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
That's it. <+++++> Do you still want the peanut butter, bread and cigarettes ?
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore? <+++++> I can't find him.
Yes, I'm sorry. <+++++> Don't be silly. What are you sorry about?
Let's try a little harder, shall we? <+++++> Will you give me a break?
I think I've been poisoned. <+++++> And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments. <+++++> Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
Don't be stupid. <+++++> All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger... <+++++> Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst? Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in -- <+++++> No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once. <+++++> That sounds to me very remarkable.
What do you say now? <+++++> I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.
I came on a bus. <+++++> Why doesn't that surprise me?
Is that for Mitch Brenner? <+++++> Yes.
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one? <+++++> I can't speak for him.
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you. I'm busy now... <+++++> Their check's no good? They're nuts...?
Goodnight, Kringelein. <+++++> No -- no please -- oh, don't go -- don't go -- don't leave me alone, Baron.
You were at the Emerald that night? <+++++> Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus. <+++++> Planned what?
A private, sir? <+++++> He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
Tony Bennett... What do you mean? <+++++> Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
Like a real sister? <+++++> We're not real sisters Jamie, but that doesn't mean I love you any less.
Telling you... <+++++> ...no...no...no...
Chicken feed. If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons --- <+++++> I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch!
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished. <+++++> I think your dinner's burning.
Hello, Bob, it's me. <+++++> Hello?
Mister, what are you dragging me into? <+++++> I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
And my compliments to you... <+++++> Alice?
Very nice. Sisters, have we learned our lesson? I won't hold this little episode against anyone. I'll try not to. <+++++> Mary Robert.
Really? Do you have a favorite piece? <+++++> I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
"Get the fuck out of my house." <+++++> Get the fuck out of my house!
Oh, but I just told you. -- <+++++> -- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes. <+++++> Can it be that easy?
Stu...LOOK! <+++++> What?
You've missed this bit. <+++++> She never gives him a turn.
Could be hers. Types match. Could be a lot of other people's too... <+++++> Second you get something on those teeth, I want it
What's the travelling arrangements? <+++++> Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together.
I know. I'm sorry... <+++++> I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff? <+++++> No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --
Ben. <+++++> Mr. McQuire.
You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about. <+++++> Yeah -- being a basket case.
Pop, I'm gonna go with Mookie. <+++++> Good, make sure he don't jerk around.
Sure -- take him to the vet. <+++++> I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
I took him out to sea and threw him in the water. Even if they find him, what connects him with me? <+++++> Magruder does.
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders -- <+++++> Fine. Just let her out.
Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered -- <+++++> -- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --
Have you thought of what you want planted yet? <+++++> The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
What kind of gun was it? <+++++> A .38.
But I have some friends waiting. <+++++> That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
What the fuck is going on? <+++++> I want you to know, I wish I could have lived like you do.
I was upstairs for a meeting. I've been hearing good things about you. <+++++> That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
No thanks. <+++++> I meant me.
It feels so.. .real. <+++++> It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs... It's a physiological machine.
What's the matter, Leo? Don't you like Coney Island? <+++++> I ... I love it. I haven't been there since I was a kid. But it's nearly two o'clock.
Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is. <+++++> What do we know? It was first sighted off the French Polynesian Pacific.
So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel. <+++++> The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
No. <+++++> Maybe you should talk to him about it.
Where are you? ! <+++++> We're coming your way, man!
Sorry. <+++++> What about you, Jim? Got anything to say for yourself?
But that's what I'm doing. Couldn't they think of that? <+++++> If they had any reason to. Why make it tough for themselves? Why go to all that trouble? Here's an open book. Close it.
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it. <+++++> What?
That was the plan. And you're thrilled to have them. <+++++> Whatever you say.
Yes. <+++++> I kissed her while she was laughing.
No shit? ! <+++++> No shit.
Salisbury steak. <+++++> I hate it.
I thought he'd never leave. <+++++> Yeow!
Of course. <+++++> 
Nothing. <+++++> Nothing, huh?
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank. <+++++> Take a guess...  <u>Let him guess</u>!! <u>Tch</u>.
See any problems? <+++++> Actually, no.
Not sleepy, either? <+++++> No.
I can. Because I choose it. <+++++> I forbid you!
I believe I can control it. Maybe not control it totally. But ... tame it enough to make it do some good. <+++++> It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
Daddy. <+++++> Don't touch him.
And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball. <+++++> Frank, please...
You've got to stop her. <+++++> What can I do?
Truman, that was our house! <+++++> I've changed my mind again. What's New Orleans like this time of year? Mardi Gras.
What's that, sir? <+++++> 
Why is there no "our" here? <+++++> Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
"Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt? <+++++> Yes. Come out, I know you're in there
You know how the airlines are. <+++++> Bags?
 <+++++> I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
You weren't there, you don't know what happened. <+++++> I know enough.
Yeah. It could get better. <+++++> No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me.
En garde. <+++++> Lay on, MacDuff.
I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life. <+++++> Maybe this'll make you feel better.
This is the Starship Enterprise. <+++++> A Federation starship.
You buying? He kinda wanders around. You'll see him if you pay attention. <+++++> I need to find him kind of soon, Elly.
Daddy . . . ? <+++++> Yes, darling?
So youÂre not at a non- profit firm? <+++++> Not with what they pay me...
Sublime! Utterly sublime! <+++++> That kind of music should be punishable by death.
I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house. <+++++> "Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
You got a problem with me, Grady? <+++++> Naw. Just killing time.
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic." <+++++> You mean if I get sick?
I will not have friends in America. <+++++> Soon Young, don't worry. You will have many friends very soon. You will see. America is a very friendly place.
The "crises"? <+++++> "Checkers" of course, Hiss, Ike's heart attack, Venezuela, the Kitchen Debate, and Kennedy.
Andy. Before we begin, I'd just like to say: everyone in this room is your friend. <+++++> You're in trouble.
It's that one isn't it. <+++++> Yeah....Shit, those guys have guns.
This is important. <+++++> Oh?
Let's let your tuchus breathe. <+++++> Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
Yeah, sometimes. Lots of the kids hang out here. You really think something bad happened to Suzie? <+++++> Lombardo ever come out here?
Don't push me, Duff. <+++++> Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
Reason? They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty. Now tell me I'm right. <+++++> There's nothing for them to get.
Just the man I wanted to see! <+++++> Turn on the T.V.
Are we going to go through this again? <+++++> Answer the question.
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson? <+++++> That's him, but... he's not here.
Where's Jamie? <+++++> That's what I'd like to know. She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki. <+++++> Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh. <+++++> Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
Return of the Jedi. <+++++> Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents. <+++++> No. You said I. I killed them.
That's enough. That's enough. <+++++> I'm sorry.
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling? <+++++> You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
I think it's cool. <+++++> You would.
And last, but not very far from least...  You gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood, looooong sniff. <+++++> I don't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese, or rip you open and eat you right here.
Depths of hell... Ohio. How 'bout you? <+++++> Kennet Square, PA.  'Mushroom capital of the world'.
My brother is gonna shit. <+++++> Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer? <+++++> Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
Who's...  Lieuten -- <+++++> Or rank. But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing? <+++++> If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
I don't know. <+++++> We should stop seeing each other.
Stop, please! I don't know! <+++++> Prepare a tear harness for the female...
You owe me fifty bucks. <+++++> Bob?
But I might be able to sneak into the office if they're not around. Then I could open the disks here in my room. <+++++> I thought they locked you in your room.
What are you doing? <+++++> What does it look like I'm doing?
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights. <+++++> What's being photographed?
Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this? This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust -- <+++++> Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion.
When are they coming? <+++++> They're rounding up a posse. Figure an hour?
How do you pay for one of those? <+++++> Well, we pay for the [?]. That guy didn't want to part with it, a little matter of nine thousand dollars.
Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially-- <+++++> Hey, is this him with Nancy?
One of their top guys, Harry Stoner, is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss... <+++++> Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me?
Cowan-- <+++++> 
It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it... <+++++> I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
Excuse me -- ? <+++++> Do you wanna wrestle? It's a good way of breaking the ice. That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together.
I should go. I should leave today. <+++++> Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt. Besides, they're only rumors.
What the hell is that? <+++++> Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing. <+++++> Incredible.
Well, terrorists of course. <+++++> How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'... <+++++> All right.
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me? <+++++> To keep from being an old maid.
I gather you're a decorator. <+++++> You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
Yes, Miles. I accept. <+++++> You do?
- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - - <+++++> - - barfs them up - -
No. You say you're cool. <+++++> I'm cool.
Right now, son. <+++++> I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is <i>my</i> job.
Unless she has nerve. <+++++> More nerve than the doctor, I must admit. He hasn't been home for two days.
What? <+++++> We stop at Pancakes Hause.
"Yet all the suns that light the Corridors of the Universe shine dim, Before the blazing of a Single Thought -- " <+++++> "Proclaiming in incandescent glory The myriad Mind of Man..."
First tell me this similarity is not incredible. <+++++> Incredible similarity.
Even cancer. Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out. I have to get started. This will take several hours. <+++++> We need someone to take us to the secure storage area.
Underground. <+++++> Hiding?
I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day. <+++++> What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
No, you're not a guy. <+++++> I am.
Greeks? <+++++> Athenians...
Got her right where you want her, Junior. <+++++> Shut up.
Hello. <+++++> Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
Can't it keep till morning? <+++++> She said you were legendary.
I'm fine. <+++++> Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
Is that your official response? <+++++> I don't have an official response, Michael. All I have are the same questions you have.
Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what I've got. <+++++> Suit yourself.
Yes. <+++++> What time did you leave?
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis. <+++++> No you're not.
After all I've done for you -- <+++++> Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --
No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way. <+++++> Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech.
Has anybody offered to buy it? <+++++> As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
I try really hard, actually... <+++++> No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do.
No. Laramie. Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that? Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything. <+++++> No, I don't.
Just a man. Goodnight Pearl, sleep tight; and don't let the bedbugs bite. <+++++> 'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
Try a fireman. Less to take off. <+++++> I don't mind the work. Pity I can't see behind the mask.
I don't follow... <+++++> We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
What...? Say the words. <+++++> I don't have the power. I said it.
Cause I like it. <+++++> It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger. <+++++> Shut the fuck up, Donny. We'll, uh, brace the kid--he'll be a pushover.
Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching. <+++++> I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
What about which girlfriend? <+++++> Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Get out! <+++++> How many people go here?
I ain't heard of nothin'. <+++++> Thanks...
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot. <+++++> Shut up.
You've been living here, in the city? <+++++> Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.
Be still ... <+++++> But you wanted to talk. Tell me.
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday. <+++++> Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
You mean the ones you pity. <+++++> Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - - <+++++> - - totally incidental  unrelated to the feeding pattern - -
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick. <+++++> Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
Call me Dudley. <+++++> Dudley, what do you want?
You tell me, Bill. <+++++> How about you telling me? When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer. That's what I'm used to.
Accident? <+++++> The fire. The way we're going we'll be lucky to buy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym.
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up. <+++++> But you're OK?
Bud, why are you doing this? It's not part of you life any more. <+++++> I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.
Finnegan... <+++++> Yeah...
I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk. <+++++> I understand.
No, I won't let you do it. <+++++> Alex, what are you doing?
Maybe the plane gave it indigestion.... <+++++> They spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it   They don't care what it is....
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke." <+++++> I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful.
Fuck the Machine. <+++++> Mountain View. Eight units.
Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting? <+++++> I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
How long have you been downtown? <+++++> Five months. I love it.
I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore. <+++++> Your brother...
Momma... are they angry with us. <+++++> No... No. It is just the English way.
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend. <+++++> It's Bullwinkle.
Kennedy. <+++++> I know, I know, stupid. I mean where you goin'?
...and unharmed, de-... <+++++> ...-spite the mouth.
Yeah? Then gimme another raise. <+++++> 
Anything off. Anything that didn't make sense. <+++++> You mean beside the fact that thirty-five out of forty-five rounds were gratuitous? I can't think of anything.
What of it? <+++++> It is true that your parents were poor. They still are. And they would like to know how you are - and where.
Our time's up. <+++++> What?! There's nothing here!
Yes. <+++++> You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne?
This is the shell. What about the gun? <+++++> Well. What about it?
That's ten bucks. <+++++> I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said, 'ten cents.'
Speak with my lawyer. <+++++> So you refuse to answer my questions?
But, Chris... <+++++> I gotta find Chet. Make yourself at home.
Where did you get that? <+++++> At the newsstand on 3rd.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship." <+++++> This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure...I think.
Take a wild stab! <+++++> I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
Why? <+++++> Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
Finish your tour? <+++++> And anxious to get started. What is this, mostly malaria?
The days of the storefront grocery are numbered. I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket. <+++++> A super market. Huh.
I don't think it would fit you. <+++++> I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo! <+++++> Mary... please. This is hurting people.
 <+++++> What other boat?
Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world. <+++++> He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano. <+++++> Nice. The last time I saw my Mom, she was waving out the window of a library in Texas.
What pills did you take? You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic. Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow. <+++++> Nooo. Is it your story?
Jordan. I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that -- <+++++> Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
Yes . . . <+++++> I know what to do about mother.
I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven... <+++++> Heaven?
Get your head out of the clouds, Kent. Where you been  the last twelve hours? <+++++> Uh...home...
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight. <+++++> Explain it to them. I'm bugging out of here.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep. <+++++> It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves - I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you. <+++++> I'm in love with Lloyd!
What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him. <+++++> Why?
I met him. <+++++> You talk like him.
Like fire. <+++++> What?
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in. <+++++> For what?
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone? <+++++> They won't care. Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic! <+++++> Max, elections happen in November. Is this not late December, or have I inhaled too much swamp gas in my time?
I don't want to talk about it. <+++++> Why not?
Are civilians inside? <+++++> He said something about a girl --
She what? ! <+++++> She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married! <+++++> Well you started it.
Were the leads... <+++++> ...what am I going to do all month...
Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property -- <+++++> Come on. Get me out of here.
You start operating, the five families will start their raids again. We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money. <+++++> No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die. <+++++> Begin!
That Cuthbert. What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit. <+++++> Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success. The museum is in debt. Contributions and public funding have dried up. Admissions no longer cover overhead.
Don't know that either. <+++++> Don't know much, do you?
I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike? <+++++> It should've been me...
Rasputin! <+++++> I know, I know ... you thought I was dead.
The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth. <+++++> How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
Where were you? <+++++> In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
What if it attacks? <+++++> Fifty yards and closing.
How do you know about my mother? <+++++> I hear you talk when I'm waiting!! !
How important do you think sex is? <+++++> Not very.
Might as well be. <+++++> Don't have Weather Channel in the Mountain, Nick.
I'm no good. <+++++> Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
She would've had to have a key, anyway, to lock the deadbolt behind her. <+++++> Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here! !
What did I do to deserve this? <+++++> You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
Yes. <+++++> Aye, I knew you were.
I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set. <+++++> How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
What's this about? <+++++> Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
What happened? <+++++> I can't fly it.
Can I? <+++++> Yes, where would you go?
I would. Yeah. <+++++> Really?
Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going. <+++++> Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore. <+++++> Duck, here they come.
Yeah. What? <+++++> Is Mary home?
Charming. More delightful people crippled. <+++++> Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again. <+++++> Good thing you have a voice-over career.
What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve? <+++++> And why would she do that?
Not until Ben is back inside! <+++++> It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man. <+++++> Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place. <+++++> Well, I don't know what to do now. We'll just have to head inland and see if we can't find a settlement.
You're wasting your time, already been tried. <+++++> Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him. <+++++> Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
Sally? <+++++> Please?
...we have a wonderful electric sign: "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski." <+++++> You mean you are deserting Russia?
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank-- <+++++> --I'm not allowed to talk to you.
That was before I met one, of course. <+++++> Now I must hear this song. An authentic pirate song. Have at it.
What the hell are dreams, anyway? <+++++> Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from.
I'm sorry. <+++++> Why?
Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him. <+++++> Dig.
Why not? <+++++> I'd rather have a client who's innocent.
Shame on you! <+++++> Uh...yeah...sorry.
Why? <+++++> Because the Jew is essentially female.
Took it? <+++++> Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
 <+++++> If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead. <+++++> Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
Christ, that's right. How could I forget. What a nightmare. <+++++> She asked for it.
Your parents would want you to be in bed. <+++++> You tell stories?
Can I sit on the stairways now? <+++++> Huh... Yeah, yeah... Of course.
That's right, sir. And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb. What if they start something? <+++++> Go on, Major. You fascinate me.
But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off. <+++++> What?
The new King. <+++++> With an old voice?
A little petting is not the issue! <+++++> Sorry. Seventeen Hail Marys and five minutes outside.
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest. <+++++> Ya still light seventy.
Rose, are you all right? Are you sick or something? <+++++> No. No, I'm all right. Oh, God, what have I done? I have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell!
Itches like hell. <+++++> Take it off and let me have a look.
No sir, I don't believe I do. <+++++> Oh. I have a message for him.
Not like He punished me. <+++++> You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole. <+++++> Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
But I just bought a good blanket. <+++++> Forget it...
I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather. <+++++> I meant, seemed like a lot of whiskey.
She's supposed to have it. <+++++> She don't want it.
What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say? <+++++> I don't-.
I know, because I felt it myself -- <+++++> I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
The King killed my son! <+++++> The cannons killed Raoul! The cannons, and love. But not the King.
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States? <+++++> Two weeks holiday.
Besides, there are more kisses than you can count. <+++++> So I can have these?
Calendar? <+++++> That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it. <+++++> You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie. <+++++> I see.
Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship. <+++++> Strong is Vader. Clouded is your fate. Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything, everything! It can save you.
What were you fighting for? <+++++> Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell.
She's really a fox, isn't she? <+++++> Did you pork her Harry?
It's a pleasure... <+++++> Ah, cheer up! Don't lose heart over what happened tonight. I predict that your next project will be an outstanding success!
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then? <+++++> Well what do you want to talk about?
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash. <+++++> You're too good to me.
I'm not the police. I don't care about experimentation. She's a kid. I'm worried to death. <+++++> You won't say anything to my parents?
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that? <+++++> It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
Just passing through. <+++++> Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view.
Why did you continue to see him? <+++++> He needed my help.
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon. <+++++> No, wait...
Don't worry. We're not gonna film any of it. <+++++> <u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>? !
What do you want to do? <+++++> We don't know what we're into!
He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats. <+++++> So you pay off our customs officials?
Understand me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in killing. It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it. <+++++> A means to an end, is that it?
What do you mean? <+++++> You have no idea what's going on.
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove? <+++++> Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass. <+++++> How do you know? You know her that good?
Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman. <+++++> He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
You're telling a lie. <+++++> Am I? Let's find out.
You don't have to sound so emphatic. <+++++> We just having our first date when you showed up.
Good. <+++++> Have you come to make peace with me?
I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen. <+++++> You're joking. You can't trust anyone these days.
It tastes bad. <+++++> But you can breathe it.
I don't know. We gotta get 'im outta here before Skipper sees him like this. <+++++> Son of a bitch! !
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong. I though you were a Han. <+++++> Give me back my comb.
Besides, what does he know about Negroes? <+++++> Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go.
And this is legitimate therapy? <+++++> Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone.
He seems to think they are. He told me that were. <+++++> Oh no, no, no, no, no. It can't be. How embarrassing.
She helped you? <+++++> Yes.
Te...! <+++++> That's not important now, Elaine. We have to talk.
...very difficult to get in. <+++++> Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.
No. I didn't know that. <+++++> A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
In English, please. <+++++> I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.
How're you feeling? <+++++> Lost my sea legs.
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry. <+++++> Really? Please?
It's a nice drive. Is that where you met Mitch? <+++++> Yes.
What. What kind of outfit are we running where...where anyone... <+++++> They stole the phones.
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?! ? <+++++> It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em.
I'm fine. <+++++> Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway.
Forty-nine point four. <+++++> It says forty- nine.
Known me for long? <+++++> Well...
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married. <+++++> Better late than never, right?
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject. <+++++> -- overseeing the most cherished movie project of my career, am walking around with a pocketful of cherry Mike & Ike's?
They're yours. Take them. <+++++> I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?
I've got a better offer. More time off. A sort of career shift, more in the engineering line of work. <+++++> How much time off?
In the knee? <+++++> Uh-huh.
How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone? <+++++> You didn't say anything about my hair.
You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car -- a '63 Buick. <+++++> Thank you.
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him! <+++++> What's the matter, chÃ©rie?
I... I don't get along with people like that. <+++++> You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
What?! You aborted our child? ! <+++++> I'm a monster. Exactly.
Dad. <+++++> Come into the kitchen. I'm just making your mother's tea.
Switch! You drive! <+++++> -- where? -
You thought the deceased might... break his promise? <+++++> Of course not. We're just not quick to run and boast. In case something went wrong.
Three-one-zero, aye! <+++++> Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!
That is why I believe in the future of my country. <+++++> I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it.
You're not a team player. <+++++> Don't point at me.
It's Sarah. <+++++> Roman that's not the line.
What are you thinking? <+++++> Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus. He won't want to go. He never does.
Reverend Chickenwing called last night and said he wouldn't be able to attend. <+++++> So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
What is -- <+++++> Just take it.
No. His name is Luca Brasi. You wouldn't like him. <+++++> Who is he?
Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing-- <+++++> Don't worry about it.
Then what is he? <+++++> Evil.
You're a silly girl. <+++++> Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
No - I didn't kill him. Would you rather I'd let them kill us - after they'd raped me...? <+++++> No. This is unreal...
Ok, dudes, follow my lead. <+++++> Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>? <+++++> You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
Oh. Do you think I have a potential as a writer? <+++++> No.
Shields, aye. <+++++> May fortune favor the foolish. Mr. Sulu, Warp Speed!
You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt. <+++++> You know what pisses me off the most?
Not Curtis. <+++++> Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
What are those people doing there? What do they want? <+++++> They're just outsiders. They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They're waiting for your guests, too --
Better. <+++++> You like it?
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore. <+++++> Then what are we going to do?
... and Rigel. <+++++> And that one -- to the right of Rigel?
And the notice? <+++++> Yes - Mr. Kane.
I'm so humiliated. I don't know what to say. I mean-- <+++++> Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
-- way we could safely -- <+++++> Oh, no!
Are you scared? <+++++> Yes.
Come in! <+++++> Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
However you slice it, that's a losing proposition. <+++++> I'm not going to rob you, mister. Do I look like a thief?
He came to make up. <+++++> There goes my chance with Sid.
It's quite satifactory. <+++++> Good, because it cost enough. There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
You're not coming? <+++++> Wouldn't be appropriate. *
Why'd you let me in? <+++++> Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry.
Skiing? <+++++> Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...
Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so? You got yourself a little playmate, huh? <+++++> Now will you get out?
How is he? <+++++> Engaged.
I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened. <+++++> What? -- go on --
Fucker! <+++++> Please.
It couldn't be me. I hardly knew him. <+++++> I'll just set it right here.
I have to ask you for that key. <+++++> What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
Oh, shit. <+++++> Oh, we're screwed, Night...
Charlie, how are you? <+++++> I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
You like playing games, don't you? <+++++> I've got a degree in psych. It goes with the turf. Games are fun.
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today? <+++++> Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
All right. Hey. <+++++> 
Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them. <+++++> I cut myself shaving.
But why, if I'm not hurting you? <+++++> You wouldn't understand. Oh, God, I must be outta my mind. What would your Momma think?
--or incredibly fucking naive. <+++++> Hey, folklore--
It's some sort of party the town is throwing. <+++++> They do it each year.
What? <+++++> Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two.
How is his health? <+++++> Not good.
Nothing. <+++++> Why the bad temper?
Fifty. <+++++> Fifty? We need seventy-five.
It seemed like she had such a good time last time. <+++++> It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo. <+++++> Of course.
Joely... <+++++> Yeah, Tangerine?
I'm talking about the girl. <+++++> Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead? <+++++> Because I'm alienated.
No. I don't want it to. <+++++> So it's helping?
Here in the canyon. <+++++> Well, it's a big canyon. Honey, I'm sorry but I've gotta get back... just for a minute.
Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact... <+++++> Dad, I...
I really need your help. <+++++> I'm sorry, I can't.
Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D. <+++++> Please Veronica. Put Billy the Kid on hold tonight, I'll never forget it.
Feel a little foolish? <+++++> Not yet.
Told you, did he? <+++++> Yes.
By the way, how is your father's side? <+++++> Much better, thanks.
Williamson...Williamson, they stole the contracts...? <+++++> Excuse me, sir...
It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...! <+++++> It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took." <+++++> "Sin from my lips? Oh trespass sweetly urg'd. Give me my sin again."
Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter? <+++++> Frida, you're not making sense. I can't come over right now.
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas. <+++++> So why'd you come to L.A.?
Got to think this through ... <+++++> Caesar, maybe we should run --
You just gonna let him go? <+++++> We'll get a tail put on him.
Well, Mister President. <+++++> What kind of trouble?
I may need you to go to work practically immediately. But meanwhile perhaps you'd like to meet some of your fellow officers. <+++++> Just one for a start.
Rollin'...and speed! <+++++> Slate it.
Pierce! That soldier requires immediate attention. I'm a surgeon and I know. <+++++> You betcher ass, General.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy. <+++++> Just a little... What's the difference?
What are what? <+++++> Those things in your hands.
When I say I love you. <+++++> Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad! <+++++> Waste magic on revenge? You have much to learn, Willow...
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can -- <+++++> Just get him in the cross-hairs. With those shells, anywhere you hit him, it'll bounce around, rip his insides all up.
Is it better? <+++++> Is what better? Better than what?
...and big fuckin' teeth... <+++++> ...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right? <+++++> You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me.
No. <+++++> Are you married?
In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to -- <+++++> Three days.
Get that out of your trunk. <+++++> 
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy. <+++++> I will not have my boys arguing.
Really. <+++++> And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
About three hours. <+++++> Cause?
The final countdown. <+++++> Oh. I brought you something.
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?" <+++++> What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over! <+++++> Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off. <+++++> Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
He's just a deep sleeper. <+++++> He's not breathing, Mom.
Thanks. <+++++> You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
I can't close the store. <+++++> You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
This ship is going down in a blaze of glory! <+++++> Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not? !
Where? <+++++> In the cash register. Step away from the door.
They don't serve wine here. <+++++> What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
Your a good guy Chris you deserve a nice girl. <+++++> Like you?
I can't go to the club tonight, guys. <+++++> Why?
Like me, too. <+++++> 
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned. <+++++> I'm still here, aren't I? See this?
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk? <+++++> I didn't mean -
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room. <+++++> I think he's moved...
Sorry if I crossed you up. <+++++> You sure have.
Huh? <+++++> It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose. <+++++> No, not that bad. It was a fella that sends you flowers every day. Er, what's his name? Mr. Norton's nephew.
Why? <+++++> They've brought me such good luck -- you --
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do? <+++++> Lose 'em.
Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies. <+++++> Really?
Why you wearin' a suit? <+++++> Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to! <+++++> Mph rm. Rmph rm rmph rm.
That was the general idea I intended to convey. <+++++> I didn't mean this future.
That depends on what they see. <+++++> Now, what do you see?
'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock. <+++++> This is a knock.
So. What happens now? <+++++> Now... you go home.
Leon, my little boy. <+++++> Oh, Leon, you are so good.
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids. <+++++> The two kids?
What was that she called you, Jimmy? <+++++> Fergus.
No. <+++++> 'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up.
You said you wouldn't laugh! <+++++> It's not you - it's the dress!
What'd you say? <+++++> I said I got his machine.
Our minds? <+++++> For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's... <+++++> You have no authority to make a deal like that. That' s for the D.A...
Hail, Mary. <+++++> Jerusalem is a real drag. Everybody hates me.
Welcome back. We did it. For real. <+++++> I know. I can feel it too.
Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want. <+++++> You need money again?
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin ! Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that? ! <+++++> What?
What'd you give for that thing? <+++++> You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
Oh. <+++++> But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her. <+++++> I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him. <+++++> Do you think this cross will protect you?
You know that the class is going to challenge your story, don't you, Clarence? <+++++> Yes, Miss Johnson...
It is only temporary, until my confirmation by... <+++++> 
I can see that. <+++++> I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
You knew about Jim? <+++++> Course he did. Just exactly when he knew is something of a question. Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
We'll make it. <+++++> Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
Vada, he was giving you an easy out so you wouldn't have to write about your mother. <+++++> But I wanna write about her.
What else did I miss...? <+++++> Atrocious Torture. Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
Why do you bring her up? <+++++> 'Cause she's always on your mind.
He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole? <+++++> You're right!
And thanks for the Cloak Invisible! <+++++> No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father!
What the fuck is that? ! <+++++> Screamer.
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well. <+++++> With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore... <+++++> C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that. You're a terrific mother--
How did he get away with it for so long anyhow? <+++++> He almost always killed strangers. Spent years moving on from one place to another. That made it real hard to track him down.
It's anti-nature. <+++++> Anti-nature.
I'm not catching a melody. <+++++> That's the point.
No. You'll have to get somebody else. <+++++> Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper. <+++++> You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car. <+++++> You're kidding.
Does it work? <+++++> No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
No. I'm going to find out. <+++++> Wait a second. There's guards all over the place. You'll need a distraction.
It's working. <+++++> Where is he?
Prepping your trip. <+++++> Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
You're glad somebody tried to kill me? <+++++> No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
I *won't* send Horace Miller! <+++++> *You won't? *
Mr. Hoover was a realist. <+++++> I trusted Mitchell. It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
I know that. There are people in some of these cars. <+++++> It's where they live. I guess after everything happened, they just needed to do what they'd always done before.
I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas. <+++++> Ever see one like this?
Not even a little bit? <+++++> I already told you I'm not.
And that's how I ended up here. <+++++> And the head?
 <+++++> 
Dr. Thompson...? <+++++> It was good of you to meet...
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us. <+++++> Britain?
That's right. <+++++> Where?
I said he hadn't written me. <+++++> Oh, then you did hear from him?
Did they ever find out? <+++++> No.
Who else knows about this? <+++++> Nobody. You. I had to tell you, right?
Too bad. He says I'm a communist. <+++++> You should watch what you say. You don't know who's listening.
Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far? <+++++> Yeah
The end. <+++++> You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again.
Yeah, Tangerine? <+++++> Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
I thought I'd help out. <+++++> We don't need you.
I wish I were somewhere else. <+++++> Where will you go, where no one has died?
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society. <+++++> Population?
We have to go. <+++++> No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
Stu was with me last night. <+++++> Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Seventeen. <+++++> Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son?
Anybody home? <+++++> As a matter of fact--
I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane? <+++++> No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
I knew him. Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill. <+++++> 'Bootstrap?'
What do you feel? <+++++> I feel as if I've eaten glass.
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere. <+++++> Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
We will know when the next one sickens. Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops. <+++++> In the meantime it would be useless to alarm the others. Let them think it was a normal  And, perhaps it was Â- perhaps it was.
I'll wait for your call. <+++++> We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.
And then what? <+++++> I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.
Is that what you want me to be? <+++++> I'm talking about you. And what you want.
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen... <+++++> Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ... <+++++> Wait, did you say wife?...Are you fuckin' married!! ?
Naw, I had that around for a while. <+++++> Sure you did. Help me with this hold cover, willya?
Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things- <+++++> But the raves about your performance-
I shouldn't tease a hero. <+++++> What?
It's a routine, like anything. What do you think? <+++++> I don't know.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh. <+++++> Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
But you threw a knife at my head! <+++++> And you caught it! Only the chosen one could have done that.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie. <+++++> So? I'll get Bugs ta do it.
What about Peter?... <+++++> Peter? Peter was a mistake. An imposter.
What's wrong with your son, anyway? <+++++> What do you care?
Well, sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still, you see, on our White House payroll. <+++++> Who? Not another goddamn Cuban?
The point was to love each other. <+++++> Why?
Sweet. <+++++> Dying.
... And then some. <+++++> What have you done to my flat?
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it? <+++++> It's under control.
Thanks. I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'. <+++++> You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
How fast can you teach me what I need to know? <+++++> How fast can you learn?
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams! ! <+++++> Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
What happened? <+++++> Who are you?
That's right. <+++++> ...so there's <u>no</u> industrial- strength HRT weapons team out there tonight?
Change my name. <+++++> What, you think the guy should change his name?
How does she know that? <+++++> Her headaches.
I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk. I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman. <+++++> It's so late.
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct. <+++++> Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
Gerry! Any trouble finding the place? <+++++> Not at all.
Who's Captain Howdy? <+++++> You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.
Are you the son of Vito Corleone? <+++++> Yes.
Where's the baby? ? <+++++> I thought you had her!
A-flat, Majesty. <+++++> Ah-ha!
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners. <+++++> So, where's "Weird Al"?
What are you doing here, assface? <+++++> Checkin' it out
And I don't think that was Tom. <+++++> You said it was!
I've got things to do. <+++++> What about my proposal?
That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet. <+++++> You hold him. I'll slug him.
A dubious distinction, no? <+++++> I guess it depends on your perspective.
What? You're kidding! <+++++> No, no, we decided!
How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school? <+++++> Well, you've got to go easy.
Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away. <+++++> You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but... <+++++> Just don't worry about it. How we doin' timewise?
What in the hell is that up there? <+++++> Where? !
I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that... <+++++> I'm sorry.
You must be joking. <+++++> Hmm. So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
He's dead. <+++++> How?
Is Jeremy okay? <+++++> He's asleep.
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic. <+++++> You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
It's much more personal in here. <+++++> A notch above the storage room.
No, I know that part -- <+++++> So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
What are we downloading? <+++++> Information.
I should go back to Florida...I don't need this. <+++++> I don't understand, where's Groppi?
What's that? <+++++> Oh, nothing. A cou- ple of my patients having a little argument.
Daddy? <+++++> Yes.
... Um ... Yes ... no ... a bit ... yes... she has got a wart. <+++++> Why do you think she is a witch?
He's gotta know why. <+++++> You think a fuckin' guy like that ever will? What more do you want, man?
Fuck you. This is bullshit. I'm outta here. <+++++> Sit down, Lombardo.
 <+++++> That's the way I look at it.
Shh! <+++++> Was that her top?
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse. <+++++> Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop. <+++++> Very small pay, I imagine. I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre.
Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side --  is that better? <+++++> Much better.
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room. <+++++> Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me. <+++++> I can't bear the thought of your torture. Take it!
How do you know that name? <+++++> I know a lot about you. I've been wanting to meet you for some time.
Hello, Doris. <+++++> Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
"Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer. <+++++> Ooh! A kind of recent record! Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice!
So -- what do we do now? <+++++> Find the jacket.
Frank Kosinski. Here's the address. Go see him. Ask him. <+++++> Thank you. Elisabeth, I didn't mean to...
...I need to make a phone call. <+++++> Do me a favor, Al.
Hey, Mister! Can I see those guns? <+++++> They're not guns. They're particle throwers.
Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back. <+++++> If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress.
Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside? <+++++> The skull is gone.
Islamic. <+++++> What's it mean, "No Hair"?
Look. <+++++> I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid IÂm in love with somebody else. <+++++> I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening. <+++++> I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do? <+++++> We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
So where's Cort gone off to? <+++++> Are you ready? He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
About what? <+++++> Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
It's payday, need me to pick up your check? <+++++> You're the best, Maxie.
Scouting? <+++++> On the Bar T... looking for... them.
Have they found my father? <+++++> Afraid not.
Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest. I just can't. <+++++> Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
How can this be? <+++++> The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process.
He has no heartbeat! <+++++> You're hurting him! !
I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet. <+++++> You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet. Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend?
No ma'am. <+++++> Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
You love him? <+++++> No.
How did they execute him? <+++++> Poison gas.
Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other? <+++++> Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.
Not exactly. <+++++> You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
Look hereÂ <+++++> Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child.
What's the name of your child's best friend? <+++++> Ask me another one--
The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered. <+++++> You really do hear a lot, don't you?
You weren't expecting me? <+++++> No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
Indeed. <+++++> That's not the way to get ahead in life.
So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer? <+++++> Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
How are we going to do that? <+++++> I know where she went.
Gimme water. <+++++> No water.
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier. <+++++> Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside.
It is their wish. <+++++> Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses. Can I make a speech now?
Nudie pictures, what do you think? <+++++> Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
You really want me to put all this stuff back on? <+++++> Yes. I think so. Show some pride, Hamilton.
There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.' <+++++> My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a... <+++++> I do not know how the fuck you lasted an hour in this job!
Well, what do you know about that! <+++++> Found in Asia!
Something on your mind? <+++++> No.
And I fully support that. <+++++> But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
Lookit that, up already. <+++++> That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers. Both up with the chickens.
He told us it's in the Buick. <+++++> We don't know which Buick, do we?
Cool? <+++++> Yeah, cool.
Why? <+++++> Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat. <+++++> For all I know, you're the rat.
Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here. <+++++> Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here. <+++++> But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
Last time I saw you was someplace very gay. I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table. <+++++> Lots of people were. Lindbergh had just landed in Paris. Come on in.
Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me. <+++++> What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
Yeah. It's a fact. <+++++> Well I'm real scared.
Sonny...? <+++++> Yeah.
I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television. <+++++> Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.
Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true. <+++++> May I stay then?
What do you take me for? <+++++> I don't know what I take you for anything...
Bullshit. <+++++> -- It's about being realistic. Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.
! <+++++> I know. I know how rough life can be. And how unfair. So here's what we do.
*Liver* killed him? <+++++> *Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
Did you get that, Hildy? <+++++> No -- what?
I'm not sure. <+++++> Think carefully?
Well, there's not much to tell. <+++++> I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
Why am I gonna mention your name? <+++++> How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
What are you reading? <+++++> 'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die?
It won't happen again. <+++++> You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay --  That's right, Miss Olsen.
And the answer was so simple. <+++++> I was gonna predict that.
It's the last place they'd look. <+++++> 
Steve Arnold... <+++++> I've had enough of this, I'm leaving.
I haven't been using it recently LESLIE <+++++> CRAP!
This is for your mama's work, and here's something for the three of you. <+++++> Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
What do you see here? <+++++> Mate in five.
Arrest them! <+++++> What are you doing? This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
... My father. <+++++> Did you tell him everything you wanted to? Did you do everything you could while he was here?
You got clicks, anything? <+++++> Nah, nuthin' on my end --
That's lovely. <+++++> Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all. I really admire the work that you do.
That's astonishing. Sera, look... <+++++> I hate to think of you in that cheesy motel. I mean...
Some of my best friends are scientists. <+++++> I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
Not yet. <+++++> I've had two meetings with him. He's a great musician. Maybe the greatest conductor in the world.
You told me Bourne was dead. <+++++> There was a mistake.
I don't know. <+++++> If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
Sheep don't count. <+++++> Yeah? What about Laura --
Germany. <+++++> You were lucky. I spent three years in the Pacific. I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
Play it cool until the time is right to make a move. Let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again. <+++++> Or worse, we'll have a hostage situation on our hands.
And...? <+++++> And, take some more pictures.
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money. <+++++> How much?
Not really. <+++++> You're off, you know? You're way, way off.
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know. <+++++> What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
They don't suspect <I>him</I>? <+++++> Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
That's none of your business. <+++++> How about tonight?
Barnes? <+++++> That's me.
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two. <+++++> Thank you, Floris.
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore. <+++++> It's giving.
I thought you would be on your way to Vegas by now. Is there something you wanted? <+++++> I wanted to talk.
How? <+++++> Could be raining!
What if I say no? <+++++> Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy. Go on, now.
He's so tiny. <+++++> I know, look at his little hands.
That one, last week. <+++++> Here?.
I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again. <+++++> Shhhhh...
Nope. <+++++> Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
No I don't. I don't take orders from smurfs. <+++++> How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world? Right now. I can do it if I get out.
 <+++++> Twenty minutes!
You look beautiful. Your hair... <+++++> I thought I'd try it. You look good.
A man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it? <+++++> Well, he got away, didn't he?
Sewing... <+++++> Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam.
Hey, where are you going? You can't do this. I can't take a dog. Nobody's ever been in here before. <+++++> You don't want to mess with me today. I'll figure something else out tomorrow.
Answer the man. <+++++> Nothing, just tourist souvenirs.
You're crazy. We're level. <+++++> Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
Two years, he still doesn't come! We need a dog that looks happy when the press is around. <+++++> Well, he's photogenic. Let's try dog bones?
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place. <+++++> I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
With what? <+++++> With the money.
What'd you get her? <+++++> Huh? Oh, umm, a car. So, to a successful transaction...
Damn! It's buzzing all around me. Ouch! I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona! <+++++> Oona? Do you suppose it's a faerie?
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations. <+++++> Have you ever shot a man? How many times have you been primary through the door?
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok? <+++++> I'm sorry.
Like she smelled it too? <+++++> Yes.
Oh. Uh-huh. <+++++> You did work for Emil, right?
Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold. <+++++> I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody! Judy, what am I going to do? I can't go home again.
That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving <+++++> We don't -- ?
Very appropriate. <+++++> Yes, that's why I brought it.
Yeah, not tonight. Not any other night. He knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit. <+++++> I wanted to meet your brothers...
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt. <+++++> Now?! It's after eleven.
We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing. <+++++> I do.
Didn't do very well, did you? <+++++> Nope... never finished one yet. I hate these things.
We went to the parking lot. <+++++> Where you shot her.
My mother. <+++++> Your mother?
What's this? <+++++> A car.
He only had a hundred an' thirty. -- I think he's good for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo. <+++++> Sure, Rocky, Bob's good for it...
You shouldn't use my name. <+++++> Dodgson, Dodgson. We got Dodgson here! See, nobody cares. Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife. <+++++> He was a seven-months baby.
I let him go... believe me. <+++++> I don't..
And you were a sympathetic ear. <+++++> Exactly.
You looking good, Little. Real clean. Clean as the Board of Health. But you missing something. <+++++> What?
Huh-huh. <+++++> Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole. <+++++> I don't really know how --
Uh. What is it? <+++++> Oh. It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I'd never let you go to.
Oh, hi. Hi, Rob. <+++++> Good weekend?
My only worry is what shape it will take. Jinnah has -- <+++++> Stop!
It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer. One last speedstar. <+++++> So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
Yes I am. <+++++> It must really be somehtin' --makin' stuff up all the time.
One moment, friends, let's give the Senator a break. Now, where'd you say you studied law? <+++++> Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense--
- right. In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts. <+++++> 'Terrorists?'
I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her. <+++++> Thank you very much, Mrs. West.
'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them. <+++++> But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life. It's obsessive. Nothing's ever on the level anymore.
What you gonna do back there, East? <+++++> Lotta rich women back there...
The scanners will read the scar tissue. Alarms will go off. Large men with guns will appear... <+++++> Right. I know --
I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me. <+++++> Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
Gosh, Letty, this is a great place. <+++++> Thanks.
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic? <+++++> Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
You don't remember you did. But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you? You remember that. <+++++> Yes.
Wha... what f-for? <+++++> Lemmee see it.
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons. My lord. <+++++> By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself. <+++++> How bad is the other thing? The secret?
We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons. Was he very drunk when you last saw him? <+++++> You were there when I last saw him.
That's not the point. <+++++> You said whatever it was you would understand.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester. <+++++> I know.
You must leave. You were not here this morning. <+++++> But I didn't do this!
There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined. <+++++> Which is guy-speak for...
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul. <+++++> Well, she's totally not here.
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law. <+++++> Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
I'll be fine. <+++++> Well, I'll leave you alone now. I just came in here to get something of mine.
She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud. <+++++> She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?
What are you doing? <+++++> Reading.
Fueled and waiting. <+++++> Good. We have an appointment in Hong Kong.
I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you. <+++++> You humiliated me!
So are you! <+++++> I mean, you feel a little feverish.
Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it? <+++++> I don't have it.
It's just you and me, then. <+++++> Come here, might as well fix that arm.
How much longer's that gonna take? <+++++> Like I always say --
I think she liked me. <+++++> Did she talk about me?
It's for people! <+++++> Then let him go and he'll follow you.
If I asked you to stop, would you? <+++++> I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
That's a nice piece of heat right there. <+++++> Thank you. I only got two bullets in the mothafucka, but it's better than nothing.
Why did you go to the hospital? <+++++> I don't know.
There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist. <+++++> But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
Give 'em a pull. <+++++> Shall I?
I'm sorry. <+++++> Last night! They were as real as you are!
Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you. <+++++> You and I will guard the fire.
Kimberly Burroughs, eh? What do you want? <+++++> I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...? <+++++> ...cigarette girls... And naturally -
Hi, is Vada home? <+++++> Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards. <+++++> He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something... <+++++> 
I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more JellÂO for me, Mom.' <+++++> Don't you get along with your parents?
Uh, yeah. <+++++> You're sure?
An investment banking house. <+++++> He's Jewish? Manzetti?
Guys... Guys... I got it under control. <+++++> Oh. He's got it under control...
Tell me -- do you think about hell? <+++++> "Hell!"
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me. <+++++> If we could scare up some men to play.
I got to go. <+++++> What?
Stop the car! <+++++> Let us out!
How about you? Was your sleep disturbed, too? <+++++> Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.
...Feels like you. <+++++> Case...
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we? <+++++> Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
Don't fret, Benjie, it's -- <+++++> Darn it, Dave.
Military record? <+++++> Honorable discharge. May 1971.
I want to believe you. I really do. <+++++> You will believe me, because it's true.
I need you to believe in me. To believe that we can do this. <+++++> John, he's got my driver's license.
Yeah. <+++++> To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free.
James, you said he was hiding in the barn... <+++++> I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid. Where a boy...
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that. <+++++> I think I'm goin' to commence dedicatin' myself twice daily. It may come to three times before it's over...
Come on. <+++++> Come on.
Maybe we shouldn't. <+++++> What?
Why? <+++++> Why? Oh, I'm sorry. Are you two, uh - - are? I wish you the best luck.
Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got. <+++++> Good cop/bad cop?
Just put some mustard on it and eat it. <+++++> You didn't get ketchup?
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar? <+++++> He's telling the truth, up to a point.
Did you call the State Police? <+++++> All their lines were busy.
Good morning, Suzette. <+++++> Good morning, Madam.
What? <+++++> The girl's dead, Driscoll. There's no point continuing on.
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand. <+++++> God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
What do you want to do? <+++++> There is somebody...
-- you know better... <+++++> -- why did you come in today?
--The L.A. Times has a huge interview with Baldwin-- <+++++> --the lookout in the Motor Inn?--  --he say anything we don't know?--
Me too. <+++++> 
Not everybody's supposed to have a family. <+++++> But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
I... I need a drink of water. <+++++> Go ahead, son.
What color underwear am I wearing? <+++++> Pink.
You are very important, Willow. <+++++> No I'm not. Have you really looked at me? I'm short! Even for a Nelwyn!
I want someone I know to take me in. <+++++> Who?
You want my partner to kiss your ass? <+++++> Would that be good enough for ya?
Why, you said... <+++++> Never mind.
Nice-looking kid. <+++++> He hates me.
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight... <+++++> I had the shot...
Certainly not. So what's that got to do with it? Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week. <+++++> Probably. There's always a chance, of course, that they'll change Mr. Kane - without his knowing it.
Think me fair, do you, Jack? <+++++> The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
You have a brother? <+++++> We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding.
I'll have to come and hear you play. what do you play. <+++++> Nothing just yet
Serveza yourself! <+++++> Now, now.
What's this supposed to mean? <+++++> Give it back to me.
I've been banished. In lieu of being fired. <+++++> I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
Oh, shit. <+++++> 
I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya... <+++++> 
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly. <+++++> You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert? <+++++> What?
You better keep a low profile for a while. <+++++> No shit. You got someplace in mind?
You know something, Harry? <+++++> I guess.
Exactly. They drank it all. <+++++> After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
Ken. <+++++> Ken.
No, he just hung out there. <+++++> And where did he go to school?
It's on the twine, too. But it's not r... <+++++> Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet. <+++++> Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him. <+++++> What about that apartment?
You had enough? <+++++> Yeah. I just want to sit out here for a minute.
I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee. <+++++> I'm lost in ecstasy! And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down. <+++++> That's what I like.
Elitism? <+++++> The wrong word, maybe. Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
Nope... never finished one yet. I hate these things. <+++++> You were reading my Renoir.
I did. But the jury won't s... <+++++> It's not for the. They only get to convict him.
What are you doing here? <+++++> Who is this man? You're engaged!
Herb wants to see me? <+++++> When you have a moment.
Where are they? <+++++> Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to -- <+++++> Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive. This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically. <+++++> Did you ever read this one--?
I wouldn't know. What kind of wife are you looking for? <+++++> One who's not a mutant.
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave. <+++++> Can he smell the difference, eh?
Speak! Go on. Speak again. <+++++> My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it. <+++++> Does it say anything on the tape?
Truth is, I'm a little nervous. <+++++> YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
What's their names? <+++++> Pearl and John.
Whatta you think? <+++++> I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
That's horrible! <+++++> No, he was a toad. Even more of a toad than Merle... I just wear the ring to keep the flies away.
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress. <+++++> Knox. Oh yes, Knox. I'm glad you called.
Oh yeah, he's alive. Technically. <+++++> And you have him?
Put me down, you lout! <+++++> You had better manners as a pig.
That's what I'm gonna do. You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister. I'm crazy. I'm psycho crazy. <+++++> Yeah, I know. You're TNT. Just like dynamite. When you go off somebody gets hurt. All right. Let's do this.
Man, did you see Huey down on Grove street? All up on that cop, that was beautiful. <+++++> Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift?
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work? <+++++> How much?
Oh, you're not going. You're staying. <+++++> No, I'm going.
Yeah, you betcha. <+++++> Well, game five was the big one. It turned in the bottom of the 6th. We were down 3-0.
How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom? <+++++> What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
Well, I've been tracking them down all morning. <+++++> You haven't been bothering them, have you?
That strikes me as odd. <+++++> James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights.
I'm not sure. I've never seen anything like it. <+++++> You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you? Can't you tell us something.
How did you know that? <+++++> Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
I'm going to apologize to Bubber? <+++++> I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
I'm just preoccupied. <+++++> Do you like my new look?
It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job... <+++++> Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess...
Can I get up now? <+++++> No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
You were... very... inspiring. <+++++> A script! I thought we just walked through everything...
But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first. <+++++> I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours? <+++++> Do you have to say that?
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>? ! <+++++> Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
What? What kind of episode? <+++++> He was just acting very strange. He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me. He was acting like...
No way man... <+++++> You cut him, or I shoot you. Make your choice.
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool. <+++++> We'd have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool.
Why not? I'm not needed here. <+++++> But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure. <+++++> You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude. <+++++> I came second to the NBA. I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again. <+++++> Okay.
Hungry? <+++++> Just some coffee.
She says she's sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant. She just likes it a lot. <+++++> What?
Well that's good to know. <+++++> Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that? <+++++> Theodore Herzel.
Let's face it. Sooner or later we all die. <+++++> Exactly.
She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them? <+++++> She's cool.
Got her mother's looks. <+++++> Her mother's dead.
Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something. <+++++> You thought any more about our murder?
Beaumont Livingston. <+++++> I knew it.
Who put up my bond? Ordell? <+++++> In cash.
I thought they'd all go "It's him! It's him!" and hug the guy or something. <+++++> Relax, Wally. He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next. Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good. <+++++> Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids. <+++++> I like plaits.
I heard you were looking for me. <+++++> You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
Does that say Xanax? <+++++> Um, um, yeah, probably. Heh heh.
You've got to respect that. <+++++> I have to say that I'm not there yet.
--jeeeeeeeeesus-- <+++++> --to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--
But I'll have my revenge, I will! Roddy, will you see me insulted? <+++++> Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake. <+++++> Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails." <+++++> I never said that.
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway. <+++++> What you got there - beers?
Maybe you'd like to come along and watch, Governor? Jefferson's done a wonderful job with that leg. <+++++> Why, of course.
How you guys doing? <+++++> I'm alright, I'm dealing.
Oh, that Karl. <+++++> Yes, Jon. That Karl.
Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal. <+++++> Why not? I need to get in there!
It is from love. <+++++> To love, you must be able to feel.
The maze has been changed -- <+++++> -- He says the maze has been changed. I need to know for sure.
His feelings do him honor. And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling... <+++++> The great and <u>beautiful</u>...
How much? <+++++> Not bad. $20. Here, $5.
He won't listen to anybody. He's been very crazy all summer. Since June he's been trying to kill me. <+++++> You try calling the police?
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me? <+++++> All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
I have a terrible confession. <+++++> Tell the doctor.
I'll be fine, Hanna. Thank you. <+++++> Good night.
Where will you go? The circus is halfway to Metropolis by now. <+++++> I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him.
Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about? <+++++> What do you mean?
Holds four. <+++++> Max?
Nothing. <+++++> What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
Why? <+++++> Too heavy.
My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan. Obviously it didn't pass muster. Deal's off. <+++++> What was your deal with Job?
Seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel. He never did. He was murdered. <+++++> By who?
What a fuckin' comedy! WNEW plays all the hits. <+++++> Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories. And a memory can trigger a smell. <+++++> I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
Does J.J. know how to use this thing? <+++++> All he's gotta do is read.
I have a way with animals. <+++++> It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
How'd you like a punch in the nose? <+++++> What! Who?
That's what I said. <+++++> Told each other everything. That why your picture's torn up in the top drawer of her bureau?
Oh, let the poor devil alone. <+++++> I did not ask your advice.
So you haven't seen his apartment? <+++++> That was our apartment.
[Who's Tazinari?] <+++++> [Head of the anti-kidnapping division.]
of COURSE. You're not scared? <+++++> Of course I'm scared.
I fucked up. I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do? <+++++> Just tell us what happened.
Hey, Sheriff. <+++++> Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations.
Sergeant, secure the boat ! <+++++> Yes, sir !
I know it's no good. I've no right to be jealous. <+++++> She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
I nearly died when we split the bill. <+++++> Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose ofÂ <+++++> George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
Yes...he's my friend. <+++++> Okay. You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national. How do you know one another?
I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours. <+++++> He was that good?
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you. <+++++> I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along. <+++++> How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
My people are good to go. You know who I mean? <+++++> Your phony FBI assholes.
Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do isÂ <+++++> Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
I want to help you. <+++++> [Not the heart, the watch.]
Was she right? <+++++> No. I love you.
You really think it would make a difference either way? <+++++> I don't know.
Hey, Pete. <+++++> Buster.
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal... <+++++> Oh baby, oh baby....
I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet. <+++++> We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen! This is happening, Kelvin. Wake up. <+++++> Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying. Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm. <+++++> But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
Where have you been all day? <+++++> I went to see Prof. Roth! You know, I had another one of those dreams last night. I saw Tommi!
Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death. <+++++> He jests.
Why special? <+++++> We're -- conducting a new experiment.
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist. <+++++> I'd kill it.
How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice? <+++++> Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
Don't be smart. <+++++> I'm not smart...I'm stupid, remember. I'm so stupid that you have to look out for me, remember?
A little bit... Give me your belt. <+++++> I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
How come he let you go? <+++++> 'Cause I didn't ask him.
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite. <+++++> Did she make mistakes?
etc. The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover. You didn't see the cover though. <+++++> Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
 <+++++> I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
I wanted to. But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit. You embarrassed me, Erin. <+++++> I know. I'm sorry. Do I get to hear what happened anyway?
I brought the girl remember? <+++++> The girl?
Not necessarily. He could go off road at any number of places. He might not even be in the country anymore. <+++++> It's Paris. The route's too indirect for anything else.
But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything. <+++++> Excuse me, I'll be right back.
And you think he could find out her number for me? <+++++> He'll do better than that.
He's comin' up -- ! <+++++> He's taken him!
Why in God's name would I want...? <+++++> No frown lines. New watch?
Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do. <+++++> Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
To the city. <+++++> Send some bodyguards.
He would have liked that. <+++++> We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting. <+++++> I once did a paper on it
 <+++++> I'm going to win this case...Mist...Mr.
I've got the grands for two nights, Charlie. You can't just -- <+++++> It's all there. Both nights.
Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka. <+++++> Of course they did.
Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system. <+++++> Batteries not included.
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me. <+++++> No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.
Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse. Any questions? <+++++> But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
Verdado. <+++++> Verdado where?
It's called Black Leather. <+++++> Intoxicating. Here, have one of these.
What? What is it? ! <+++++> The sky!! !
What are you talking about? <+++++> The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
Will he be okay? <+++++> We'll do our best.
Makes no difference. Get him out. <+++++> Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
I don't know shit about electronics.... <+++++> You don't know shit about anything. Time you learned....
Ouch! <+++++> Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he? <+++++> That's not what's important.
The "old mouth to mouth" resuscitation routine. <+++++> There's a lot more where that came from. You're not leaving again?
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch. <+++++> Hope you find him. I love that dog.
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting? <+++++> The Doctors.
So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it. <+++++> I can't, it's yours.
Stanley, you can't do this.... <+++++> Could we have you in here, please...7
Naw. <+++++> Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me. I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he?
Lemme see. <+++++> Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you. <+++++> I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan. <+++++> That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
Did my work please you? <+++++> How could it not, Excellency?
How about your wife and son? How do you think they'll take to it? <+++++> They'll love it.
Four men. Babylon soldiers. <+++++> Can you walk?
You mean -- you really want to draw me? <+++++> Indeed. I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
I heard. <+++++> No kidding. I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
That's an evasion and you know it. <+++++> It is?
Parasite! <+++++> Harold!
That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency. <+++++> I don't know...
I didn't sleep well. <+++++> Do you want to talk about it?
You mean Twombley? <+++++> Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
Don't point it at James! <+++++> Voila!
I don't gotta go. <+++++> You gotta go.
That's Rache's song! <+++++> Sugar. I was slow dancing to that song before Rachel was even born.
Man! <+++++> Man. I'm sorry. Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast? <+++++> Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
Okay, okay! Okay. <+++++> You got an idea?
Can you guess what I'm going to say next? <+++++> He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi. <+++++> You will go to palace there.
How are you? <+++++> Another young man.
You must bring something heavy to the deal. <+++++> That's right, me.
Wait! I've waited seven years already! How much longer do you want me to wait? <+++++> If God intends you to go, then you will go.
Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out. <+++++> Oh... chamber runs. Uh huh, that's good. Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
Ash, you've gotten me enough -- <+++++> No boyfriend of mine is going to walk around in negative-five degree wind chill without a goddamn good- looking coat!
Then who's buying it? <+++++> There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you...
Alan's in Utah. <+++++> I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
Don't shit where you eat. <+++++> I'll remember that. What do you do?
'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right? <+++++> Not necessarily. That's where this ...  comes in. No, I've had a better idea than sacking people. You'll hear soon enough.
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven. <+++++> I know, but...
Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style. <+++++> Say what? Honestly, sugar, you can talk more shit sometimes?
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ... <+++++> RamÃ³n ... listen to me ... I'm in a	jam ... I had to get a job ...
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing -- <+++++> No water -- What a place!
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody. <+++++> You are very important, Willow.
would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal. <+++++> And this is why you never told the D.A.
The Pearl? Oh, that's fine. And just how do you expect this to work? <+++++> You give me the Pearl. Then I tell you who you need.
Of course. <+++++> So what's her name?
Will that be cash or charge? <+++++> Better make it charge.
Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display. <+++++> This. is killer.
MMMmmmmmmmm. <+++++> I'm going to untie you -- can you understand that?
EMI in London. I work with Ian. <+++++> Ah.
...Not far, now. <+++++> Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now? <+++++> Yeah...
Oh, no, no. Well, yes! I love you. <+++++> Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah. I jus--
Do you intend to marry, my lord? <+++++> Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.
Are you okay. <+++++> Something Grady told me today about the people that lived here last. Girl went crazy - saw her boyfriend killed in the house across the street...
Bingo. Okay, here we go...  Want to help Terrance and Phillip? Meet us for a meeting at Gladdy's barn tomorrow night... <+++++> Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour. <+++++> You are on your own?
So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark? <+++++> Can't say.
Unless what? <+++++> She's cheating on him.
He went home sick. <+++++> Jesus. All right, what's the address.
No, you're his wife. <+++++> I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time.
Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing? <+++++> It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead? <+++++> V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.
Yeah. And then it hits that little thing. That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever. <+++++> Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill? <+++++> Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
I'm coming in. <+++++> I don't want you to!
Always wanted to see the upper lines. <+++++> You donÂt take no for an answer, do you?
You know how much I'm paying for private school? How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather? <+++++> Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
-- in gold. <+++++> I'd like to know where you'd get it....
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton. Tell me what you know... <+++++> What I know, Paul, is... He's going to take you out...
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo? <+++++> Yes, Mr. President.
I think you're wrong, David. She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s. <+++++> Ahm....
You sure you should be playing, Carl? <+++++> What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.
This is show business? <+++++> Look, miss. We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
No. <+++++> But you're planning to be?
You're outside? <+++++> Uh-huh.
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang? <+++++> As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy? <+++++> I better make a list.
It's a no go, Joe. <+++++> Marylin!
I seem to remember that you like to help yourself. <+++++> That's not very kind.
He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one. <+++++> Jeez, and I never heard of him.
And a sort of slightly sick feeling? <+++++> That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
A hotel? <+++++> It's a loft.
That's right you travel so much. <+++++> Yeah.
Where's the bloody - <+++++> - torque wrench.
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born. <+++++> Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
What took you so long? <+++++> Don't even start, old man.
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued. <+++++> Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
I don't understand how you can like being alone so much. <+++++> I'm not like you, you have your wife.
I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts-- <+++++> It wasn't me.
I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down. <+++++> That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
Ni! <+++++> No. No. No!
'Cause it's nicer than my place. <+++++> I've never seen your place.
We want it back. <+++++> Okay.
There's talk of that. <+++++> Someplace where no one knows her. Someplace strange and new.
I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped. <+++++> Can I give you a lift? I somehow find myself driving again.
I can turn on all the faucets in my house. Even the hose. <+++++> But we don't drink from the house do we.
Okay? I'm sorry. I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay? <+++++> Okay.
He killed her. <+++++> What?
Tough, tough! <+++++> 
What disease? <+++++> I don't know.
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday. <+++++> But you're not going anywhere, are you?
Money -- Ever heard of it? <+++++> Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
You sound very cute, very nice. <+++++> Thank you. What do you do, Barry?
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO. <+++++> Did we get our bill yet?
He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear. <+++++> Sobek. Half man, half croc, oldest God--
Four Grand. <+++++> But you don't have the money?
Hm. <+++++> How did I get here last night?
Tonight. <+++++> Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.
From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it? <+++++> Arnie, this is crazy.
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another. <+++++> I would have time for my own pleasures!
We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>! <+++++> That's fine, Otho. Just keep me out of it. I am here to relax and clip coupons.
Delly... thanks, thank you. I'll take good care of this. <+++++> Just remember two things. First, the law is a living thing. It made us free and it keeps us free.
Blake said that? <+++++> Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard.
You got him wrong. <+++++> Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total                 + of seven times when he was on the force.
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight. <+++++> Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs! <+++++> What?
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it. <+++++> We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob. We're talking actionable harassment. Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
My secretary? <+++++> You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
You know the answer to that. <+++++> Can't he come out for one day?
Well, yes. <+++++> Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee.
I didn't do anything, mommy. <+++++> Well then who did? !
And your only goal is...?? ? <+++++> To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
We can't get rid of him? <+++++> He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
How long till the room fills ? <+++++> I'd say about thirty to forty minutes. Give or take a few.
Sister where are your sheets? Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin? <+++++> No.
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is. <+++++> But have you ever seen it? Think back...
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most! <+++++> Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less!
Not me. I'm not drinking. <+++++> You quit drinking?
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot. <+++++> Fuck yeah, she is.
I'll call her. <+++++> Won't forget?
Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved. <+++++> Did you move the bumble bee pendant?
She wants to have an affair with me. <+++++> She said that?
Impossible. <+++++> I just read somewhere --
I thought you got rid of... <+++++> ...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...
Never thought of that. Busman's holiday. <+++++> What's in Big Sur?
Nunez was chasing Dunbar. <+++++> Because he'd shot Mueller.
I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur. <+++++> I wonder if it runs in the family.
What things made you so sure? <+++++> Oh. Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.
_We_ sure are. <+++++> ...You gonna kill me?
Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you. <+++++> Who is it this time--my mother?
A lie? <+++++> An error.
I... <+++++> ...position...
"Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to? <+++++> Oh. You got it backwards. I already had the name when I started looking for somewhere to settle.
I... no... I don't have the right... I... <+++++> No, I don't have the right. You're a <u>news</u> <u>story</u>!
My reserves are exhausted. I must have the gems that power my suit. <+++++> You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
You're wasting your time, Duke. Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with. <+++++> Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.
So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold -- <+++++> -- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
That's good. I could use the money. <+++++> But we need to start off with a bang! Something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see. Mmm.
And this thing can grow it? <+++++> Yes. Pollux bought one along with the original batch. Obviously, he found a way to make more.
I don't think so. <+++++> You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron. <+++++> You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
There's a pizza place over on Market. <+++++> Cute waitresses?
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey? <+++++> That sounds wonderful. How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
 <+++++> Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
No, no, no. <+++++> That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches ÂÂ <+++++> You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
Well, they must be something sexual, because Ann gets freaked out by that shit. Are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something? <+++++> Not exactly.
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick. <+++++> My point exactly! Somebody had to die before his shit got in the paper! Fucking Kennedys get away with everything.
If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you. <+++++> Don't you remember? I'm already dead.
What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it. <+++++> But -- how'd you know it was mine?
Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now. <+++++> You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that -- <+++++> I am King, d'Artagnan. I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
I know so. He, them, they're not to be trusted. <+++++> So what do you want me to do?
I mean, you blew off our date at last minute. <+++++> So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.
I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint. Is there sand in my eyes? Are you cleaning sand from my ears? <+++++> No sand. That's your drugs speaking.
What? <+++++> He did. She's in the picture. I went over to look and she's gone. The table was set for one.
Yeah. That was a good party. <+++++> You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read. You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake. <+++++> Well what do I tell him?
Back to San Francisco. <+++++> Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
How do you feel? <+++++> All right, I guess. One hell of a hangover. Look, Ripley... I...
What's Nicky doing down there? <+++++> Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house... <+++++> What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
Montana? <+++++> 
Not at all. <+++++> Why are you?
Cool, bro, now listen up... <+++++> ...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
I like her. <+++++> And don't be so obvious!
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes. <+++++> Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
Doesn't suit you. <+++++> How would you know?
We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret -- <+++++> So you framed him. The same way Childs was going to frame Pike.
That's a laugh. If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him. <+++++> But if he said no before then...
What clues? I'm going to work Helen Hudson. <+++++> Would you step outside, Sergeant?
No. I didn't say that. <+++++> Then what, Norman?
Since when is faro a business? <+++++> Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
Does this have something to do with that man you saw? <+++++> Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret. <+++++> Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant! It starts at seven! <+++++> It's only one o'clock...Why don't you get another Fudgesicle -- I'll be done soon -- really soon.
It belongs to Pop. <+++++> Pop?
With ten thousand? Nine. <+++++> He's got that kinda money?
Look who's back from the dead. <+++++> Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em... <+++++> And ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill? No way. Send 'em back to the Eighth Dimension as soon as we find the Overthruster.
You can't fight'em that way... <+++++> You two jackasses hauled us way the hell out here...! ?
So...you hang out here a lot? <+++++> Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
Break it down to me, what's going on? <+++++> Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that? <+++++> ...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
I know. I know. <+++++> Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE! ! <+++++> I beg your pardon?
What can be done has been done. <+++++> MOTHER! Tell me!
Like what? <+++++> Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger.
For what? <+++++> Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
Now that's the way I see it an' that's the way I want it! ! <+++++> ...It's very American.
I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you. <+++++> No, he hasn't. If I offended you, I'm sorry.
I saw him in Vegas once. <+++++> Are you a gambling man?
Shoes, Hats.... <+++++> The special hats of the Special Anti-terrorist detachment of the Border Patrol.
Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco. <+++++> From a city? That doesn't make sense....
Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad-- <+++++> If you grew up to he anywhere near as good a man as your father was, I would be happy! I would be thrilled.
Leave Me! <+++++> Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up. <+++++> ... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you. LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning. I have been blessed.
Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back. <+++++> It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out? <+++++> Why you dogging me up?
And you're a nice man, Quince. <+++++> Thanks.
Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart? <+++++> Till the last firework fizzles out tonight, detective, you sit a desk. And, after that, I'll decide if you keep your shield.
Our neighbors gave me a ride. <+++++> Al! !
Yeah, hold on. <+++++> Just call me later. I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
Then where's it coming from? <+++++> From you, Norman. From your mind. You're doing it.
To a great weekend -- <+++++> Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!

I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?. <+++++> Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
Where did you get these? <+++++> Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously!
Joey's right. Janiro's up-and coming, he's good looking... <+++++> What do you mean, "good looking?"
Except this time, the mission IS a man. <+++++> That's the rub. I liked Wade. Who's Ryan?

I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing. <+++++> What time are you gonna be there?
Oh, sure. Here. Anything else, Beth can get you? Some more chicken, perhaps. Let Beth check the fridge. <+++++> C'mon --
The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs... <+++++> With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie. <+++++> All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
Is someone there? <+++++> Eve, listen carefully. The man you think is your husband -- isn't.

So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces? <+++++> Exactly.
That there Frank Burns is a menace. Whenever a patient croaks on him it's either God's will or somebody else's fault. <+++++> This time he did it to a kid who's simple enough to believe him. Why don't you dump the mother, Henry?
What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do? <+++++> Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner.
And what is your name? <+++++> Phoebe.
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man. <+++++> Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything.
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me. <+++++> So you're going to fight fires now, huh?
You never would have recognized me, huh? Check out the suit! Looking good, no? You know I'm the world champion? <+++++> Yes, I know.
How did you get off the island? <+++++> Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.
It's been a tough day. <+++++> A wasted day.

Friends? If we gotta be outside the country, where do you wanna go? Any country. Just name a country. <+++++> Wyoming.

Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later. <+++++> Okay. Bye.

Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man. <+++++> Get knotted!
It's okay. Really. <+++++> Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year. <+++++> How many times a year.
Let's get out of here! <+++++> GALE WATCHOUT!
Roger? <+++++> Yeah.
He said 'Jack'. <+++++> That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got. <+++++> I am in receipt of your favor of yesterday.
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you? <+++++> Sean --
Was Granma bad? <+++++> Granma's dead.
I made them go out. I made them take me to the movie. To that theater... It was my fault. I killed them. <+++++> Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
What are you talking about? You love your job. <+++++> From the day I started...to today. Can't stand it.
I've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site. <+++++> Look, even if by some miracle Michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless. Give the troopers a chance to search.
You look upset. <+++++> I'm not upset.
He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats. <+++++> Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by "demonic voices?" <+++++> There weren't any voices.
You heard? How? <+++++> A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
You know... we've been going together for a week and a half... <+++++> And what?
Sore throat? <+++++> Uh-huh.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it. <+++++> Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
He hasn't been home for two days. Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin? <+++++> He knows you shattered his violin.
Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex. You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it. <+++++> What kind of things exactly?
Yes? <+++++> I need to ask you something.
Lloyd. <+++++> What?
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue. <+++++> Look, I'm a very nervous man.
You know, this is the cleanest cab I've ever been in. This your regular ride? <+++++> Yeah. I share it with the dayshift guy.
When will I hear from you? <+++++> As soon as is humanly possible.
You shall have quarts to drink if you like." Ah, how he cozened them. <+++++> We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
Izzat the thing... <+++++> Indeed it is.
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality! <+++++> What's the magician's weapon?
Ummm. Stalling, eh? Anything new? <+++++> Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
So ... let's go ... <+++++> He told me to take you to his conference room.
Antonio paid for it. <+++++> Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way. Maybe it's not very admirable. Well, you and Artie can be admirable. <+++++> Joe, I can't look at you any more.
I wouldn't mind being famous. <+++++> Who wouldn't?
What? <+++++> Okay -- I'll admit it: I'm totally, clinically insane. But I'm still the only one who actually got a check tonight.
Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style! <+++++> Oh, Betty --
Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me. <+++++> What do you do for a living?
Why do you polish that thing all the time? <+++++> You're talking to me?
Hello, Jake. <+++++> How are you, Lou?
Yes, Victor, I was. <+++++> I know how it is to be lonely. Is there anything you wish to tell me?
Oh. A nice one, I hope. <+++++> Yes, ma'am.
I'm afraid. <+++++> If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you?
wish I knew you better. <+++++> Thanks.
What? <+++++> Your hand's all wet and it's shaky. You're so funny.
You're asking me why? <+++++> I'm asking.
What are you talking about? <+++++> The Oracle. She told me this would happen. She told me...
What'd you find? <+++++> A Butterfinger wrapper.
Charlie...I've got to see you. I want to talk... <+++++> Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
Why? <+++++> Because I like you so much. You have coffee here every morning, don't you?
State your case, Mr. Prosecutor. <+++++> Learned Judges: My case is simple.
Thanks, honey. <+++++> Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo." <+++++> Airport Ho-Jo!
I think so. <+++++> What do you mean, you think so?
What's the matter with her? <+++++> Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
He had a girlfriend? <+++++> Nope. She did. Like I say. It never panned.
What was the money for? <+++++> He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it.
It is time to clarify the situation. Everything is over between us. <+++++> But you can do the same thing in six months. The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
Tell me, is it bad news? <+++++> No, no, just listen. You won the Wreath  fellowship.
How's it feel? <+++++> How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.
Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it. Okay, he's playing it cool. Let's finish up and get out of here. <+++++> I'll get one more reading.
What's the matter with you? <+++++> Tell them to go!
You could say. I don't even have it yet. <+++++> Darrell giving you problems?
What? <+++++> They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
But you love me don't you? <+++++> Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
Do you thill want to do an arwticle on me, Jethica? <+++++> Yes, you and the whole Special Needs class.
A new world record! That's great! It gives me something to beat tomorrow! You ever been to Tahiti? <+++++> No.
We are clear and free to navigate. <+++++> Course heading, Captain?
What the fuck was it? <+++++> All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex. Not real sex.
They had them on the big one.... <+++++> I have coffee in the thermos.
Yeah, well I kinda figured that. <+++++> 
There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ? <+++++> Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
 <+++++> *I* was with her.
We've teamed up with a sex offender. <+++++> So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
What's wrong, Doctor? You seem... lonely. <+++++> Oh, a little. But it's not just physical loneliness. It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
Meaning? <+++++> I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.
Now I understand. That helps. I can make them understand that. <+++++> Okay.
No? <+++++> No. Your eyeball goes. The top of your head. Gotta wind up with athlete's stomach.
Oh. How come? <+++++> I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
It goes very high--we've got to find out where-- <+++++> --we will--
You don't know what you're talking about. <+++++> Really? What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure. <+++++> I'm sure, I said.
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I... <+++++> There's nothing they can do to me.
Relax. We'll drop the song. <+++++> Guess I got a little scattered.
What was-? Why...? <+++++> That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.
No kidding. I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen. <+++++> This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest. Wait. Use the frosted glasses.
We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community! <+++++> If that were true, this would be one seriously constipated town.
We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town. <+++++> Have you examined them?
Why? <+++++> 
I'm just thinking of how she's hurting. Lost. Alone. Like her life is over. <+++++> That's little egotistical.
Yes. <+++++> It needs batteries.
*No*! <+++++> The man downstairs said number--
I <u>swear</u> to you... <+++++> ...and I want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..
You do this -- for friendship? <+++++> I do this because I was there,
Yes, Master. <+++++> Live ones where only the dead should be?
It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug. <+++++> I had it coming from someone.
Marion! What did you tell the police? <+++++> Nothing about you.
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles. <+++++> Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
It's impossible to find. Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight. <+++++> Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work.
Can I help you, sir! <+++++> What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us. <+++++> Like how?
Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell." <+++++> Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.
God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry. <+++++> Yeah. It's pretty good.
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right? <+++++> Right.
What do you mean? <+++++> Tubab means white man.
We'll take reading as we go. If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away. Simple. <+++++> Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.
Leave? <+++++> Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest. <+++++> God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?
How old is she? <+++++> Four.
Stuart? <+++++> Yes.
--almost a year before he left the Justice Department-- <+++++> --jeeeeeeeeesus--
But, how do I start for Emerald City? <+++++> It's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
Don't you <u>touch</u> that...I want them gone. <+++++> I signed the permit. I don't know how I can.
I didn't eat any pizza. <+++++> I told you, he's got diabetes.
Incredible. <+++++> The Emperor has given him permission.
What, senorita? <+++++> When you are going to see Pedro, does your heart beat until you tremble?
Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks. <+++++> I'll think about it.
I would have tried not to. But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have. <+++++> How could you have done that?
But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them. <+++++> Vaguely...
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man. <+++++> All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep. <+++++> No, there's another point I want to iron out.
Be careful. <+++++> Of course, I'll be careful.
What is this? <+++++> Those are her belongings.
Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that? <+++++> I don't know.
For a month. <+++++> A month.
I say we don't want to appear greedy. <+++++> Oh. That.
What're you writing, Lois? <+++++> an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting?
You're not even listening to me. <+++++> What? I'm sorry. You were saying...
Ummm... <+++++> If things remain as they are ... He's got the anti-war vote.
Yes? <+++++> Aristotle.
Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit. <+++++> Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
They won't tell you anything. <+++++> I can be very persuasive.
Get outta my way. <+++++> You're wasting your time. There's nothing in there.
And you can't concentrate with me around?. <+++++> It's difficult.
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this. <+++++> Kids are supposed to get detention.
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk. <+++++> Oh, please.
No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no... I'm on a very special quest. <+++++> A quest?
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you? <+++++> If I say yes, will you take your hand away?

McCall, you all right? <+++++> I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
You can't admit, even to yourself, that it's gone, Al. Do you think those POWs in there did? <+++++> No, sir ...
We're already getting complaints about frivolous search. <+++++> This is a murder investigation. The public should be happy to co-operate, to get this disease off the streets.
What about the staff? TheyÂre in on whatÂs going on, arenÂt they? How many of them? <+++++> F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, IÂve got to get to...
Michael!... <+++++> Get out, Mom! Run!
I am comfortable. <+++++> Ha, ha... all right, well, uh I guess you can bring out the pasta.
 <+++++> You, you don't under...
You had better manners as a pig. <+++++> I am Ergo the Magnificent, and I do not travel with thieves and robbers.
Just wanted to see. <+++++> You know the rules. You do know the rules, don't you?
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together. <+++++> He helped you?

Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS? <+++++> Well we can't just stay here --
Kay? What's your 20? <+++++> Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?

... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria? <+++++> Oh. Right. I'll call him.
A-14. <+++++> Miss.
I don't think that's such a good idea. <+++++> Just do it.
Please. <+++++> She didn't call Tyler. I'm neutral in her book.
Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place. <+++++> What does he mean by "target audience"?
No thanks. <+++++> Don't worry, I won't report you!
Yeah... <+++++> Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?
You don't secretly want the attention? <+++++> I'm not even sure I deserve it. After tonight I'll have almost as much screen time on your show as I do in my movies.
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything. <+++++> That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie.
Why not? <+++++> It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with. <+++++> No, I mean
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed. <+++++> Caesar?
What about me? <+++++> My men think you died and floated away in the Seine. If I wanted to, I could let them believe that. But that would be illegal...
It was more in passing. <+++++> You're so far off! Hal... Hal Sinclair... your co- star. Remember now?...
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan. <+++++> Yeah.
I'm fine. You rest. <+++++> I feel like driving.
Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press. <+++++> Are you deaf as well as stupid?
Who's calling? <+++++> You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time. <+++++> That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight... <+++++> Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
Dorothy!... Dorothy! <+++++> Dorothy Vallens?
I'm sorry? <+++++> You.
So... To happy endings. <+++++> To happy endings.
Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back. <+++++> What I do isn't about revenge.
I made no deal! <+++++> I don't buy that.
Patkin was a tribute to baseball... <+++++> ...and one helluva guy.
Followed by non-human manifestations. <+++++> Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it. <+++++> Of course you did! Twenty-six carloads of munitions gone off like a trick cigar! The S.S. is running around in circles.
Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player? <+++++> Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank!
I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa? <+++++> Oh, most definitely. Got the brothers here in full alert mode.

Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there! Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead! <+++++> Guess not.
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it... <+++++> The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?

The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school. Rachel will recognize the car. She'll get right in. <+++++> Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help. <+++++> Maybe we shouldn't.
Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles. <+++++> Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.
Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand. Why are you doing this at all...? <+++++> That's none of your fucking business...
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert. <+++++> Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite late.
Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right? <+++++> Yeah.
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging. <+++++> My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men... <+++++> Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
Any further thoughts on the subject? <+++++> 
"Our" Crow...? <+++++> Come now. You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims.

After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard. <+++++> I blast the lead car into oblivion...
It's in New Jersey. <+++++> New York.
Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good. <+++++> You're livin' in Edina, then?
How's my favorite President? <+++++> Busy. But you've got his heart.
You are responsible...What has happened? <+++++> We're not sure...
Look. <+++++> No.
I have an appointment this after- noon. I need someone to take them to the park. <+++++> What? And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders?
Fucking A, my friend. <+++++> The others are called Skank, T- Bird. Street names. Funboy. Watch me, office Albrecht.
I'm really sorry... <+++++> It's terrible. People won't even return my calls. It's like I don't exist.
You have something to say, Yamamoto? <+++++> The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans. No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk. <+++++> Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.
God, you're anatomically correct! <+++++> Just <u>say</u> it.
Even if I were inclined, I've had better -- and a lot safer -- opportunities to kill off a wife. <+++++> Three times, to be exact.
Advance, Sergeant Major! <+++++> Sir!!! Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!
What do you believe in? <+++++> That you guys shouldn't be here.
Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here. <+++++> But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now.
What did he say? <+++++> At least he wasn't thirty-six.
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup? <+++++> You talk as if he were a gigoloÂor something.
Morpheus... <+++++> I've been looking for you, Neo.
You want us to fire a shot if... <+++++> No...nor build bonfires...nor beat drums neither. I'll meet you on the far side.
-- Ruined my exit! <+++++> Help!
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large. <+++++> Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want, man. I just want your word.
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into. <+++++> You sure as hell haven't been any help.
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but -- <+++++> Out? Out out?
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life. <+++++> Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
Really? <+++++> Yeah.
I can't give you a lift back tonight. <+++++> Don't worry.
Yeah, I'll do that, Dave. <+++++> Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?
Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone. <+++++> Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do. It's the American way.
The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body. <+++++> Into what?
Okay, the whole thing goes "The future is not set. There is no fate but what we make for ourselves." <+++++> She intends to change the future somehow.
... I will. <+++++> Then <u>I'll</u> help them. For a price.
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings? <+++++> No. [Beat] Not around here.
Ass right. <+++++> Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down.
Good morning. <+++++> Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
Why do you keep playing at being so humble? It's a little embarrassing. <+++++> Why do you play at being drunk?
Got a match? <+++++> Very funny. Very funny.
Put her on. <+++++> What gives?
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise. <+++++> Me? ?
The word, sir? <+++++> The word is no. I am therefore going anyway.
Stepmother. She's out torturing the movers. <+++++> Lydia. Try to be civil. I'm going to see if I can set up a noise-free zone in the study.
He's why I watch Jerry. Jerry's the bait for Jonas. <+++++> He's shown himself. Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end. <+++++> You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?
What's wrong? <+++++> I don't know who I am.
Call me what, sir? <+++++> Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?
Alonzo... <+++++> What...?
Mine? <+++++> Yes. Yours. You haven't murdered anybody. You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident? It must have been.
My daughter was a virgin! <+++++> I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk. I just kept all PG&E correspondence in one place. <+++++> Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.
None of your damn business. <+++++> Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.
Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972... <+++++> This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours. <+++++> Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
Really? <+++++> Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
How much of this island have you explored? <+++++> I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start.
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee. <+++++> Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
So maybe this is my dynamite. <+++++> Dynamite is dangerous.
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does. <+++++> Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
Hello? <+++++> Amy, it's me. Listen very carefully..
Finn ... <+++++> In my pocket.
There you goÂtrustin' people again. How many times did I tell youÂ <+++++> He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world. We are all part of the same compost heap... <+++++> Tyler...
Sure, but what is this? <+++++> That's not your affair. Name.
Very, very? <+++++> Yes -- very, very big!
Yes, I saw you see me. <+++++> Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
What have I done? <+++++> Only what's right...
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over. <+++++> Probably.
Lloyd says it's a publicity release... <+++++> 
Oh, no! <+++++> 
But you will get what you pay for. He doesn't need to be Superman, does he? Can you go fifteen grand? <+++++> For a year?
So each man make your own decision... Those who are goin', be back here in an hour. <+++++> Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line.
See you Tuesday, Frank. <+++++> Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house. <+++++> Where to?
Doug...Bob McClane. <+++++> Nice to meet you.
We're immortal. You've always known that. <+++++> Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
It's got a name. Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here. <+++++> Let's see what's on the other side. Maybe we'll find some copper.
Coming? <+++++> What use am I?
What's the matter? <+++++> I've lost my napkin. It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
You know, that's really getting annoying. <+++++> I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
I'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men. <+++++> And after the game, we're going to trade.
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way... <+++++> Whatever you need.
Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more. <+++++> They don't? Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?
How long have you been up north? <+++++> Six months.
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe. <+++++> They are not going anywhere. I cut power to the  shuttle.
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files? <+++++> He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.
I have a life! <+++++> Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother.
We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see? <+++++> We'd be in all the papers!
Tell <u>me</u> everything. <+++++> No.
Hi. I'm here for the big show? <+++++> Your name, please?
There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael. Things are going to change around here when school starts. <+++++> Gotta go, Mom.
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle- <+++++> Oh no, I'm okay.
I suppose you'd like the top down. <+++++> If that's okay?
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it. <+++++> Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
Not in a cab... I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together... <+++++> When was the last time you took one?
Dreams? <+++++> I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
You think they're watching? <+++++> Oh, they're watching all right. They're watching.
Yes? <+++++> It's Sim. We're almost there.
All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please. <+++++> What an extraordinary request!
Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder. <+++++> I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things. <+++++> In general.
Are you coming home? <+++++> Yes. Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
Dick... <+++++> I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre?
What is this going to cost? <+++++> It's completely done on a contingency basis. That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third... that is, of course, the usual arrangement...
I know what you're up to. <+++++> I don't have time for this, Sayer.
What's with the cameras? <+++++> Hundredth cabinet meeting. I thought it was a nice touch.
You didn't go all the way. You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million. <+++++> But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war. <+++++> Why's it gotta be Tommy!
Public Domain. <+++++> And what? What? She was Driven From Her Home, by Albanian Terrorists.
You have a name, missy? <+++++> Elizabeth --  Turner. I'm a maid in the governor's household.
What happened? ! <+++++> There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.
A waste of time? Why? <+++++> Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.
If I were married to him, I sure wouldn't walk out. <+++++> Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit! Look after your things, your things!
I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me. <+++++> Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
Maybe you should give it some time. <+++++> I guess.
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey. <+++++> Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that. <+++++> Pretty stiff.
No bleeding. <+++++> What is that?
Where are they? <+++++> I don't know. you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.
Same way you did. Through that gate. <+++++> I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea -- <+++++> A bad idea.
I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon. <+++++> To do what?
What are you doing? <+++++> I have to go...
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000! <+++++> Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me. <+++++> You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold. Would have slit our throats if he had the chance. <+++++> Doesn't matter. Whatever he wanted he didn't get it. We've got no need staying around here. It's light enough.
So they caught up with you, too? <+++++> At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home. Now -
Kristen, can you pull us out? <+++++> They sedated me. We're stuck here till it wears off.
It won't work. You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here. <+++++> I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive.
What did they say? <+++++> Uh... they said... they will think about it.
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand. <+++++> My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front. <+++++> I think pregnancy is beautiful.
We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go on back to bed. <+++++> What are you doin' with that damn hammer?
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom. <+++++> Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze. Wade, would you do that?
From a -- girlfriend. <+++++> No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
Sit? <+++++> I've changed my hair, you see. Since our last session. Those old snaps look rather dowdy now.
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like -- <+++++> Say there's just one "mole" working there, like Barton at the DOJ. How do we know he's not the guy we've contacted?
Does he know? <+++++> No.
He got better. <+++++> I hate pronouncing people dead over the phone. Better, huh? They're fixed and dilated. He's plant food.
Is he upset? <+++++> He didn't say anything to me about it.
Max won't let me drive Jess to dance anymore. <+++++> Who's driving her?
I <u>must</u> go. <+++++> I'm crazy about you!
Then eat around it. <+++++> No.
Not now, Elaine. <+++++> I mean until we start to burn up.
I have come to claim what is mine, Father. <+++++> I recognize you only as my son, no more.
I know what you're trying to do -- <+++++> I'm trying to free your mind, Neo, but all I can do is show you the door.
I tried to break it off! <+++++> You should have tried harder.
What is it? <+++++> May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand.
This play? <+++++> Yes, and acting! It's got to be one of the most wonderful things in the world.
What're you trying to do? Wake up the whole goddamn hotel? <+++++> We were just having a little discussion about morality.
He'll never know. <+++++> Two-to-one he dusts the keyboard for fingerprints the second he gets back.
Remember....what Mary Brown said-- she could see the witch's hands on my face, her mouth sucking on mine. <+++++> Anna's the witch.
Oh, right. Dwayne. You're engaged to Dwayne? <+++++> It just happened. I didn't plan it. I was alone. And he was... there. But now everything's changed.
While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant. <+++++> What do you think I am?
What is Mac out? <+++++> Follow me my Asian brother.
It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit -- <+++++> And as usual no one believed me...
Yeah, if you've slept. <+++++> You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type. <+++++> I'm not going to marry him. I just went out with him once. I know! Why don't we go to the movies tonight.
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL! <+++++> AND DID YOU?
War. <+++++> War?
For the flat. <+++++> No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round.
You mad at me? <+++++> Not mad.
It's only a siren... <+++++> I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights!
Yeah? <+++++> You know, you saved my life. And I just wanted to say... I forgive you for talking during the movie. Almost.
Eh, hi, Andy. Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere? <+++++> Of course. But only on Monday nights.
Well . . . <+++++> Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night.
So what do you want?... An autograph. <+++++> I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
Wrigley? <+++++> Miles.
You're in my head? You don't know my name? <+++++> I just got here.
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?" <+++++> "The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine."
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place? <+++++> Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
It needn't be; not if you've another story. <+++++> How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
What is your idea of being a Jew? <+++++> Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you. Why don't we continue this on Thursday.
He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning. <+++++> He turned out all right.
Austin, what's your point? <+++++> Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because...
And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave. <+++++> How did she pay you?
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16. <+++++> Why?
The situation has changed. <+++++> That so?
Like I psyched myself out. <+++++> It's no big deal.
I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it. <+++++> We'll do it next Monday.
It's warm. <+++++> James, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians. <+++++> This must be some important boat.
We're never getting out of here. <+++++> Shhh...
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store? <+++++> I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
Our house. There was water coming in all the windows. <+++++> You're worried we're going to be all right. We're going to be all right. I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.
I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome. <+++++> Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep. <+++++> If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system.
But, Mom... <+++++> Not another word! I can't believe you're doing this.
Would you like a piece of cake? <+++++> No. No thank you.
How long until we reach the Rift? <+++++> Seven minutes.
The staff and guests! How many? <+++++> Now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.
Oh, you know what? I'm trying to convince him to produce a play. <+++++> Oh!
... You silly sod. <+++++> What?
Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery. <+++++> Phone number.
Show me an American who can keep his mouth shut andÂI'll eat him. <+++++> Okay, Beany, bring 'em in one at a time.
What happened? <+++++> Do you want to go or not? I'm offering you a way out of here.
This concrete? This is still America. <+++++> What do you hear?
Don't you? <+++++> Oh you bet. Will you excuse me for a sec?
Yes. <+++++> Their child died, and they got a lawyer.
Not that it matters. This is the morgue? <+++++> You up to it now?
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake? <+++++> I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
Why do people go to war? <+++++> I'll play your silly game.
You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen. <+++++> Umm, I don't think that...
Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature. <+++++> Here's goodly gear!
Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo? <+++++> I told you...
No! That's his table. <+++++> You're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now.
If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason. <+++++> I should be a swallow!
That's yes? <+++++> That's more than 'yes' -- that's 'you bet.'
What's going on? <+++++> Rain.
Mummy has a special technique called "Deep Therapy." <+++++> What's that?
IÂm going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfatherÂs name, the glory of my people. <+++++> No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
Thanks. See man? <+++++> You know? I remember coming here with my parents.
What's going on here? <+++++> Tell me again. Your wife.
I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm late. I'm on my way to see Viktor now. <+++++> No, I understand. That's what I want to talk about.
Her brother. <+++++> Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
What do you want to call me at the office for? <+++++> I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE. <+++++> YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
Was he a good detective? <+++++> I wouldn't know. That time he caught me was a accident. I led with my right.
So long, kid. <+++++> Wh-wh-wh-wh...
Hanson, please. <+++++> Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
Oh.. <+++++> Oh.
So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it. <+++++> Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out." <+++++> What's wrong with your son, anyway?
It's already out. <+++++> The Police, then...
The press has gone berserk. The jury will be influenced. Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case. <+++++> That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us.
I haven't said anything of the sort. <+++++> But you would like to know where she is?
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina. <+++++> Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.
You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir. <+++++> It will be your own torture. I hope to God it will torture you to madness.
Why did you jump? <+++++> No!
It may be extraterrestrial. <+++++> I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this. Y'know, I've been here...
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight. <+++++> ...Stop jivin'!
--I don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore-- <+++++> --shhhh! #5, there's something up there!
Who's chest? <+++++> Jason's. It came out of his chest... a hand with long blades on the fingers...
Yes. <+++++> Mrs. Jacobi after her changing. The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
I don't know how. <+++++> You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
Huh? <+++++> The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
Then why do you try to get in? <+++++> Fuck them.
You're comin' home, precious. Santos' gonna drive us to the San Antonio airport. <+++++> Mama, Sailor's in deep trouble here. I just can't leave him.
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed. <+++++> Remember -- listen up! Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration. Check yourselves.
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!! ! <+++++> Okay, okay! Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him. <+++++> Why?
Nice conversationalist! Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject. <+++++> It's natural. A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it. It's part of how you are able to track them.
So what happened? <+++++> There was this monster. He was after me. He wanted to kill me.
...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime. <+++++> Yes. Franklin, you can't live there anymore. With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat. You have to go away.
You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother. Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse? <+++++> I swear.
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that? <+++++> Can we turn the light on?
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown... <+++++> "If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
Do you have a phone? <+++++> I had it pulled. People callin' all the time. Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
Damn you! <+++++> We're both of us damned, my beauty.
But sometimes I cried a lot too. <+++++> I didn't. I just waited.
Of course not. But it ought to be organized. Just an editing job. You can find somebody. <+++++> Who? I'd have to have somebody I can trust. When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured? ! <+++++> Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
No problem. <+++++> I made that paella you liked. It's on the stove.
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me? <+++++> It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
Nope. <+++++> She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
Some -- somebody's father? <+++++> His name was Sean. Six years ago. Francis pool.
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be? <+++++> I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother! <+++++> She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
Look, Nosey--your pals would like to get in on this, wouldn't they? <+++++> Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
Just another sleepover at the Riley's. <+++++> Just like old times, ain't it?
Plank is going up first. There is a cage but it is never locked, is it Plank? <+++++> No.
Jim? <+++++> It's not what it looks like!
Admittedly... <+++++> Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter. We're up eight cents per share.
You've been in this house for a while? <+++++> I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent. The one who takes care of the other two. <+++++> Jesus...
One hundred and sixteen minutes. <+++++> Director?
Did you hear me? ! <+++++> You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames? <+++++> Now, Hildy --
Don't, Beth. <+++++> But I have to, Norman.
Your concern is heartwarming. <+++++> It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street. <+++++> Where's Audrey?
Sure. Then we had a fight this morning. <+++++> At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.
Merry Christmas. <+++++> Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
No. <+++++> Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
Jackson, Steinem... <+++++> ...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.
Yeah. <+++++> I'll see you later.
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt. <+++++> Go to transportation, get a ticket.
Yeah, go on... <+++++> Good news is that yeah, I found him. The bad news is...
Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain. <+++++> Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
What are you doing at home on a Friday night? <+++++> I have plans.
There is no one here but the dead. <+++++> Go away! I don't want you here.
Maybe I can change him. <+++++> I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
Fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter. How you gonna get a boat? <+++++> Don't worry about it.
I'll see you there. <+++++> Right behind you.
What's gotten into you, Sheriff? I was -- <+++++> YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
Bite radius. You know, the size of the mouth? <+++++> The whale's mouth?
Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about? <+++++> I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
I'm sorry, I don't recall -- <+++++> Left field somewhere. Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
Why'd you go to Harrison's? <+++++> To buy lingerie.
Will you listen, dammit! <+++++> Don't piss me off, junior. Or I will repaint this office with your brains.
Me, too. <+++++> I'm Michael.
W-w-w-we'll do it another time. <+++++> Hey-
Start the car. <+++++> You believe me don't cha?
Get out. <+++++> Sure. Wait a minute -- haven't I seen you -- ?
I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage. We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it. <+++++> And?
Ok. <+++++> You can't be late though.
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until afterÂ <+++++> I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
You don't know any way you'll trust me? <+++++> Nothing comes to mind.
Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others - <+++++> Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
Yeah, uh, what's the movie? <+++++> It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
Goodbye, Bobby. <+++++> Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.

What do you love so much? <+++++> Your Majesty
You can do it. <+++++> In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy. <+++++> Huh?
The zoo. <+++++> The zoo. What are you waiting for?
I need more light on that, Four. <+++++> Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of -- <+++++> -- yeah, yeah, yeah. You just have your hundred grand ready. For that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.
She told us the story of Freddy. It's a town legend. He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality. <+++++> So?
George, you look terrible. <+++++> Yeah, well...
I think it'd be better if you talk to me. <+++++> Yeah?
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish? <+++++> Why selfish?
Get me a couple of beers and a salami. <+++++> We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system. <+++++> But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune. Come to bed, darling.
Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish. <+++++> She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding? <+++++> Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move.
...the, the, the symbol of the fire... <+++++> The <u>Firehouse</u>...
This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold. <+++++> Okay, arms up, lean forward.
What! ? <+++++> Have a good day, gentlemen.
Shooting? <+++++> Yeah. She says we gotta get used to being alone in this neighborhood. 'Bye, Dad.
Put this on! <+++++> I'm not leaving without you.
Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years. <+++++> Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
And the rent is okay? <+++++> Oh, it's nothing. No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells. <+++++> Do you have your own cell?
What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go. <+++++> You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
Now there's a picture I'd like you to -- <+++++> You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
I don't know. <+++++> Did you tell Alice?
Why not? <+++++> I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.
But -- <+++++> Please.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun. <+++++> I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
I'll never forget this. <+++++> I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books. Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true? <+++++> Who told you this, Majesty?
You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff? <+++++> Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?
STOP! You're making...mistake. <+++++> It's your mistake.
Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved <+++++> and she is mine...
People just...disappear. <+++++> The earth just opens up and swallows people.
Was it a butterfly? <+++++> A moth... How did you predict that?
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me? <+++++> No...
Where? What do you mean, where? <+++++> Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
Sylvia Plath. <+++++> M'hm...
Naturally. <+++++> I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things? <+++++> Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
Where? <+++++> Away from here.
It doesn't look all that different. <+++++> The future doesn't look different?
So how long to pop the floor? <+++++> Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
Maybe he'll have some advice. Maybe he'll even talk to your father. <+++++> Are you kidding? Don't be ridiculous.
Are we interrupting, Andy? <+++++> In a word, Bob...
If you said yes I would have had a reason. You should let me redress those bandages. Before you go. <+++++> I'm okay. Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other. I can shoot a pistol!
I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner. <+++++> Hey, how about a little nightcap?
We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it. <+++++> But he's--
I'm fine. <+++++> You're the shrink, aren't you?
Can I do what? <+++++> Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
You know what? I don't take it back. <+++++> Why are you doing this?
I do. <+++++> What it smell like?
But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends? <+++++> Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral.
What'd you say about me? <+++++> Shut the fuck up.
Why are you doing this? <+++++> I just wanted to keep an eye on you. The guy's a total stranger, remember?
Ho, diplomatist! <+++++> How about New York?
Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient... <+++++> Sometimes.
Why don't we both forget about him? <+++++> Alright!
I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming. <+++++> I do not do it for others. But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
NO. <+++++> You are leaving, aren't you?
That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent. <+++++> Managers get ten percent.
Of course... But how? <+++++> How what, Wendell?
So does your tongue cramp up? <+++++> Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
Eight -- and seven months. <+++++> Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin. <+++++> What is, Red, the intention or the act?
Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing? <+++++> Cause I'm a fucking werewolf! !
For the money. <+++++> The money. Yeah. That's a right smart of money...
A "little white lie"? A "little white lie"? <+++++> What would you call it?
-- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone. <+++++> Someone not his wife?
And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh? <+++++> Are we in Brooklyn?
I knew. She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act... <+++++> So it was "love".
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes. <+++++> I'll come with you.
Just go check the temperature. <+++++> Don't move!
Nice boat. <+++++> It isn't mine. Let's get a picture.
All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you. <+++++> You haven't finished your beer.
... I'm partial to the tight end. <+++++> This is USDA Prime, largely available, beef. With no notice- able competition, present company excepted...
Time's up, Admiral... <+++++> Here it comes. Now, Spock.
Those guys ain't so tough. I fought plenty of guys tougher'n them. <+++++> Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.
What're we looking for? <+++++> Any irregularity in the pattern.
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide. <+++++> Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
Can you tell me why you killed the puppies, Plato? <+++++> No, sir. I just went next door to look at them like I always do. They were nursing on their mother and I did it.
Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember. <+++++> You remember Halle.
No I'm not. <+++++> Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never! <+++++> And how many have paid the price for your impatience? How many have died? How much damage have you done... And what is yet to come?
Have you ever retired a human by mistake? <+++++> No.
Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in. <+++++> I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something. <+++++> Is she bringing him to the wedding?
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer. Who are you? And how do you know Zephram? <+++++> I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --
Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer. <+++++> I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from.
You have to put things in perspective. <+++++> I know, I know.
... Just call me when you have it. Ike, how is the story coming? Is she a man-eater? <+++++> Or a vegetarian?
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold. <+++++> ... It's a pretty short trip.
 <+++++> Who is "Danny Terrio?"
This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean? <+++++> Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
Don't invent stories; go to bed. <+++++> A black bull came.
How do you know they're not? <+++++> I went into their room this afternoon.
What, and miss all the fun? C'mon, not a chance. So, what's the verdict? <+++++> Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years. I'll serve two.
The dreams again, sir? <+++++> I think they're getting worse.
Where's he living these days? <+++++> He's got a new place at Burnham.
You want to dance? <+++++> I can't dance fast.
If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be--I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man... <+++++> Kramer, I'm sorry. All I was trying to do was--
Tell me. <+++++> Don't worry. I get it.
No? Was Mozart a good man? <+++++> God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence.
Mmmmmm. <+++++> Wait a minute. Promise me something.
You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated? <+++++> I guess it's possible.
Plain-clothes man. Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death. <+++++> Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.
Umm, he's going to make it isn't he? <+++++> Maybe.
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable. Take sidearms, and flare pistols -- <+++++> Sidearms? But the saucer's dead.
You're wrong, George. <+++++> I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know anyway.
Hi. <+++++> Having a good time?
Am I in trouble? <+++++> As far as I'm concerned, yes, ma'am, you are.
 <+++++> I see.
Call me. <+++++> Okay, bye.
How about a little of the King? <+++++> Well, why not a little of the King?
What? <+++++> Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you... <+++++> You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away.
Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing... <+++++> With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--
Jesus. <+++++> Hey, it's the best way to tell.
I just don't think she liked me in that way. <+++++> Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
His blind friend got "attacked." Angelo went up there, and some- how, it got itself in the paper. <+++++> <u>You</u> put it in there.
I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that? <+++++> He wants a reconciliation.
Not here, Duff. <+++++> I get it. Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.
You got a telegram from headÂ­quarters today. <+++++> Headquarters!? What is it?
You really love this guy...? <+++++> He's got great hands.
Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill. <+++++> John!
One has nuthin' to do with the other. <+++++> Oh, it doesn't, huh! You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...
Why not? <+++++> These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
Yeah, so what do we say? <+++++> I thought you had something planned.
I don't even belong here. This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is. An accident. <+++++> Oh...
Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back. <+++++> You want what? !
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone. <+++++> Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
Cold War's over, Jerry. <+++++> So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>. How much do you think an airport security system goes for?
Doolittle... <+++++> Yes.
Uh huh, I wanna hear this part. <+++++> Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you? <+++++> Yeah. Exactly!
What? <+++++> I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation.
Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it. <+++++> Be like a weight off your shoulders.
Hello, Liberty Missoura! <+++++> All this time in the saddle... We get to the farm, I'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all. <+++++> Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
I am not! <+++++> Then let's go talk to her.
Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know. And either do you. <+++++> You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney? <+++++> She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
Get in <+++++> EXT. DARLENE'S STORE - NIGHT.
What for? <+++++> I don't know.
Well? <+++++> Well, I'm stuck with two and twoÂbut I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it. Where do you come in?
We certainly did. <+++++> We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy--
I'm here. <+++++> Boy, I'm blind as a bat! You got a match? I'm going to break my neck in here. Where are you?
All right, look. I can make it Right, I can make this up to you, Mattie. I can, I swear. <+++++> Will you go to her and tell her Right in front of me she's Nothing to you? Right out loud so I can hear?
Sure. <+++++> Maybe all she needs is some company.
Not yet. <+++++> Nervous?
How deluded can you be? There's no <u>why</u>... <+++++> Who's responsible? !
-- see this, television! <+++++> Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
Wow, it's the red one? <+++++> Oh, it's magnificent!
Why don't you take a break, Jack. <+++++> All right, Mr Reynolds.
Yes -- I think it is. <+++++> Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
I'm fine. <+++++> [Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
No you didn't. But he did change. Just not enough. <+++++> Jamie, you're not mad at me. You're mad at Landon --
Sir, I recommend we raise shields. <+++++> Not yet, Mister Worf.
No. I -- <+++++> I know a man who needs a refill.
So, what are you doing tonight? <+++++> Shooting.
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles. <+++++> Just a second.
I know. I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --? <+++++> You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
Oh, hiya, Pete. <+++++> So, no goat hooves, huh?
I mean that sincerely, don't thank me. <+++++> You warm my heart.
Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do-- <+++++> I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*!
Please let me go. <+++++> All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents.
I suppose so. Yes. <+++++> And charming?
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic. <+++++> Oh. Sorry, Newt.
Fuck you, Mr. Kane. <+++++> I will not have this in my home.
Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind? <+++++> Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!
This is Zero. <+++++> Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
How long have you been driving? <+++++> About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold?
Right, exactly! <+++++> I think it's really a wonderful piece, Margaret!
Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach? <+++++> Yes, sir.
A little bad luck? <+++++> Okay, a lot of bad luck. But that means the odds are probably in your favor now. This is no time to give up.
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear? <+++++> I've never had a girl.
What makes you think he'll do it? <+++++> He seems like he thrives on danger
Who's the pigeon? <+++++> Excuse me?
Who's your candidate? <+++++> I haven't got that far yet. But I don't think that everything points to Wynant. What about the alibis?
Oh? <+++++> This used to be my secretary's room.
You hear that, you and this whole damn court house; what you are doing is wrong! <+++++> Don't tell me about what's wrong. You come into my office as a friend and steal city files!
Not at all, Dean. Good of you to spare the time. <+++++> I came as quickly as I could.
We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom. <+++++> Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you. Of course, if that's what you still want.
You know those little dogs you see people with? <+++++> Like a Chihuahua?
Why? <+++++> He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
I said it was bad judgment! What else do you want me to say? <+++++> You see what I mean? You're being defensive. Isn't she being defensive, Bob?
Are you sure you parked it there? <+++++> Of course, I'm sure. Ah, Christ, the puberty police are back.
Either he falls in line with us and behaves himself or I'll break him so wide open they'll never be able to find the pieces. <+++++> Jim, I won't stand for it.
She took off in the night! <+++++> She took off on the bicycle, man.
I haven't been able to do that since I was a little girl. <+++++> You did it the other night.
WhatÂs an hour of your time worth these days, Nathalie? Combien, Nathalie! <+++++> Cinq cents.
Go away. <+++++> That cleaning woman doesn't...
What you telling us for? The only thing I care about is whether you get your rest in. <+++++> Tom, you're all heart.
Smith." Oh, but it was the way she *said* it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish! <+++++> Saunders--!
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around. <+++++> Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly? <+++++> Oh, yeah.
I wish it were. <+++++> Then what would be enough? If we were married?
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>... <+++++> Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
Really? What kind of exhibition is it? <+++++> I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...
Hello. Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap? <+++++> Um -- not right now.
Great. <+++++> I'm gonna clean it up.
I must go. I'm in a hurry. <+++++> I want to talk to you later.
What? <+++++> Your manner.
How long you think this'll take? <+++++> Twenty-four minutes.
There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer. <+++++> Remember Daniel Grant? Do they say, "without Daniel Grant, there is no Baer/Grant Publishing?" He's gone sailing, Alan.
It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid. <+++++> No, I'm not afraid. Tell! Shout it from the housetops!
You have eighteen of my men. I want them back. <+++++> I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
Ted! Do something! <+++++> What do you want me to do?
Then why are you here, Joe? <+++++> I came to see you.
I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that. Who should I tell him called? <+++++> My name's
Can we come in? <+++++> Stop asking me that. I'm fine. Who called you?
Where are you going, Diane? <+++++> I'm going home.
Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth. <+++++> No!
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm -- <+++++> You <u>need</u> a doctor.
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death. <+++++> She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
You think they'll find any? <+++++> POWs? I don't know. But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks. Cream?
He drives a carriage. <+++++> What?! ?
Oh, That! I'm 5555 SRT Entron.. <+++++> I don't care.
I can't. They're following me right now. They'll meet me there. They'll halo me. <+++++> How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished. <+++++> Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
What? <+++++> On the phone. Was it for you?
NoÂno. <+++++> But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.
Mph rmph rm rmph rm. <+++++> What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
I'm serious. No interference. <+++++> Nobody's gonna interfere with your running the casino. I guarantee it.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama. <+++++> Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
Same thing? <+++++> So what do we do now?
It is just a regular card. <+++++> Son, I can take everything you got with that deck. It is marked.
Will she still love him with that special perfect love? <+++++> Have to wait.
I don't anymore. <+++++> Can I have some?
No. God no. <+++++> Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
He got a little jealous. <+++++> I'm sorry, I didn't...
That's right. <+++++> But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh? <+++++> ...Yes.
I like you... very much. I was thinking that maybe. <+++++> Don't say any more.
Are we just going to go on sitting here? <+++++> He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
Say yes. <+++++> No.
I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective. <+++++> Friendship's a lot different out here. A wrong number is a relationship. But then this isn't a social call.
Oh, no! <+++++> Yes.
Good evening, Mrs. Cook. <+++++> Just who is here, can you tell me?
I have love all over. I even have love for you, friend. <+++++> Is it real love?
C'mon, man! <+++++> We think NLR. We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure. <+++++> Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
Big man! <+++++> Yeah, how much you wanna bet?
Yeah. <+++++> He'd want to know about all this.
Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them. <+++++> So you <U>are</U> a man after all.
You motherfuckin' Tino. You fucked us so bad. <+++++> I fucked up. You can't help your greedy black lying ass from trying to get everything.
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore... <+++++> ...not until you book it...
And I kicked ass. My best stuff. Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried. <+++++> She's making this up.
Well, shake a leg. Get these files downstairs...  And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music. <+++++> Yes, sir.
He had no reason to. <+++++> Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
What did it say? <+++++> None of your business. Am I still bleeding?
The loser ran off alone. The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder! <+++++> Shall we track them both?
Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted. <+++++> Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
Come in, Dave. Have a seat, make yourself comfortable. Coffee? <+++++> Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison? I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election. I congratulated you, remember?
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again. <+++++> Uh... We can't leave Washington 'till we find that chick.
I see you didn't DOR, Mayo. <+++++> Hey, Sid, thanks.
I found it! I found it! <+++++> If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
I started livin' the day I found you, you know that? <+++++> You're playing the other side.
No no no, no no. <+++++> Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
Don't worry. It's a test. <+++++> It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
And then we're gonna do her right here. Right? <+++++> You're always so coarse... "Do her right here." Let's just see what happens, okay?
That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in- <+++++> Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
What?! Hush up, you mouthy little shit! <+++++> Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately. <+++++> I been working on a few things.
I am. Hur you? <+++++> Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul.
When'd you start working here? <+++++> Roger got me on. I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me. <+++++> But I love you, Laura.
Congratulations. <+++++> Thanks.
No, I'm On Top of it... <+++++> "...unsure whether or not Enemy Action..."
What? What are you talking about? <+++++> I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
Many others. <+++++> And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
What? <+++++> They're hauling Misery into court.
Where'd he go yesterday? <+++++> Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.
And how do you figure we do that? <+++++> All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape. We'll set him up somehow.
There are no rules! Why the fuck are you doing this? The Nite Owl made you. You want to tear all that down. <+++++> With a wrecking ball. You want to help me swing it?
Can you stand something to eat? <+++++> Love a cup of tea. With lemon.
What am I wanted for? <+++++> I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
What Scar? What fucking scar? <+++++> AAAANK. That's not how we play the game.
What? <+++++> Get up.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today. <+++++> Yes.
Don't you feel so much better now that you know everything? Blink once for yes, twice for.. <+++++> Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
Groom. <+++++> Yes, dear.
Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time. <+++++> I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you?
But how do I know...? <+++++> Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
Can I come out? No. <+++++> I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
And there's a guy... He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me. <+++++> Lothos.
You know this guy, don't you? <+++++> I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
You got me. <+++++> Now listen, Ben.
Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail? <+++++> No thanks, Swana.
How'd he die? <+++++> He was murdered.
So what's it going to be? <+++++> Well, I've paid for the ticket.
Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed. <+++++> You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
Hey Shelly, like seafood? <+++++> Uh huh, why?
Are you absolutely certain? <+++++> I can't do this now... please.
"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"? <+++++> I lied.
Your Spiderman Pez dispenser! <+++++> Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved.
In what way? <+++++> I dunno. Just funny-looking.
Yeah, I guess so. What are you going to do now that you're home? <+++++> I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
Yes. <+++++> So he was mean?
Said who? Sugar? <+++++> Hey, I'm learning as I go.
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them. <+++++> Give her time. Beauty is skin deep.
Today is Tuesday. What? <+++++> I've got to go see Gruber. What's the best cigars you have?
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something. <+++++> I hope it means something, otherwise...
You're doing this to liberate the Remans? <+++++> No race should be a slave to another.
We can't lose. <+++++> How can you be so sure?
Well? <+++++> If she is, the machine works.
The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer <+++++> Her favorite poet.
Next week. <+++++> With you, everything's next week. I want to go skiing soon. Tomorrow?
There you go with those moves again. <+++++> Too aggressive?
"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt" <+++++> "How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
Can I come in? <+++++> Yeah. She's sleeping now, I mean --
Where's Stacy? <+++++> She doesn't want to talk to you.
I think you have too much to do tomorrow. <+++++> TOTALLY!
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean? <+++++> No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game.
C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off. <+++++> I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
Yes. Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged... <+++++> I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
I don't care. Load me a deck. Set it up for threes and nines. I'll cut it in on his deal. <+++++> What do ya want the others to get?
What could somebody get for them? <+++++> What could we get for them? I don't know.
Materials. Nothing more. <+++++> You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?
Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash? <+++++> No. I couldn't see.
Don't be nervous. <+++++> Get away from that door.
I haven't been working on anything. <+++++> Do I get to see it or not?
What do you think of him? <+++++> Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
My God, Alice. <+++++> It can be dangerous...
So we got a deal. Four deputies--- <+++++> And me.
A habit of men of war, sir -- you understand. <+++++> Of course, Captain -- an unfortunate necessity.
And me? ... <+++++> Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good. Of course you'll continue as DCI. You're doing a magnificent job.
You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island! <+++++> What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity? Where do you think she gets it?
I see it before me. <+++++> I'm not sure I believe. But then I had no one to instruct me. I had no mother... and my father abandoned me at birth.
<i>You drove Lateesha's daughter to school... then dropped her off at the DMV. Why?</i> <+++++> <i>Her car was in the shop.</i>
What is this? <+++++> Long story.
Will your girl friend get back to the city all right? <+++++> Tom said he'd take care of it.
She is guilty. <+++++> No, sir, please... she is innocent...
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself? <+++++> I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir. Sorry about all that. <+++++> That'll be all, boys.
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now. <+++++> But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
Call 'em here -- ? <+++++> DO IT! NOW -- !
I just liked watching him bend over to clean the filter -- <+++++> I believe you! Don't worry.
Oh, my goodness! <+++++> Oh, Elliot!
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight. Will you be there? <+++++> Sure. You want me to find out about Quaid? I mean, the funeral?
You're our best and only friend. <+++++> Thank you.
Alright, alright. <+++++> Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!
Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over. <+++++> Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies. To the tree of the dead. Maybe we passed it by. <+++++> How could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention?
I came into this world flat on my ass. <+++++> And now you have everything.
...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity, you and Big John, it'll lead network news. Okay so far? <+++++> Sounds good.
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre? <+++++> Yes, Sire.
Master, Bruce? <+++++> ...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline? <+++++> Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before. <+++++> That's because I've been on the wagon.
What?? ? <+++++> Poppea. She was his wife. And she was unfaithful to him. So he got mad and he jumped on her.
Yeah. <+++++> Yeah.
Did I frighten you? <+++++> You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are.
Was it a nice funeral? <+++++> Oh yes, lovely funeral, Gernaldi brothers did a beautiful job, lots of pink roses...I used the white hearse.
No idea. I didn't even know the damn thing still worked! <+++++> It works.
Better make it charge. <+++++> I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
Who? <+++++> Holden Caulfield? <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
I think I can remember what's on them. <+++++> William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
My lady VIOLA. <+++++> Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
This won't hold for eleven days. Guy fucked a twelve- year-old...whadday're gonna do to hold that off? <+++++> What do you think would hold it off?
Baltus Van Tassel. <+++++> Did your father take a loan?
Mr. President! <+++++> Mr. President!
What Truth? <+++++> The truth that you were sent here to murder me, ans so far you haven't done it. And do you know why?
Wait! <+++++> What?
Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though. <+++++> Sure. Why not?
He'll do something. <+++++> Uh uh.
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand... <+++++> Read me what she said.
I just want to know why you're here. <+++++> Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
The girl with the purple fingernails? <+++++> That's her--tall hungry woman with fire in her eyes. It was great.
Right. <+++++> Wrong.
What's he like? <+++++> You trust him. He's got that strength. You'd die in a second for John.
Who doesn't have such thoughts? We'd better get going. <+++++> You're not having lunch?
Jim Garrison? <+++++> Yes.
I don't know what happened. <+++++> I do. Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.
Viceroy of the West Indies. <+++++> Congratulations. Then I am free to search for the mainland.
That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A. <+++++> I object.
What's happenin'? <+++++> They're comin' with us.
Is someone else here? <+++++> No. No one to speak of.
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon? <+++++> Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants. They're paying a higher rent. <+++++> How much more a month?
You going there? <+++++> Yeah--why--
Machines hate you? <+++++> Yeah, they hate me.
So what're we looking for? <+++++> Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
Right: Lovers of the world unite! <+++++> And we won't stretch up our arms...
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris! <+++++> Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
This Rae... you get with her? <+++++> Shit. Who hasn't?
Wrong. All we've got to worry about is Ambrose. Nyah will take care of Nyah. <+++++> What are you talking about?
 <+++++> You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere. First place, you'd get hung and you know it.
Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot? Or is it actually being an idiot? Besides-- <+++++> I know, I know. I read the manual. No attachments. We work alone. Blah. blah.
 <+++++> How about a check?
I'd like to find one of those myself. <+++++> Oh really?
Just one last question. What does the sign on your office door say? <+++++> Doctor Steven Trammel. Cardiologist.
I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady. <+++++> Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
I'm okay. <+++++> Here, take my jacket.
That's Renee alright. <+++++> I suppose so.
Never mind. Wet a towel and wrap it around your head. That'll muffle the signal. <+++++> How'd you find me?
Don't give me that bullshit. Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are a fucking lock. I wanna make some money. <+++++> Are you sure?
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you? <+++++> Don't fuck with me, Nick. I don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling.
Thank you, Doctor. Now -- <+++++> -- but I don't believe it to be the truth.
No, I never saw him before in my life. <+++++> Well that must've been mistaken information we got. Thanks for straightening it out for us. There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.
It's too late. <+++++> Too late for what?
What's the matter dear? What have I done now? <+++++> Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
So, does Tricky Dick know about this? <+++++> I won't tell him if you won't.
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and -- <+++++> You do? You do love me?
That's right. <+++++> But it's a top three school --
Did you remember to pay the phone bill? <+++++> Yeah.
I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I can hear. Shut that dog up. Is there a ladder? Is there a rope? <+++++> I don't know! Get me out! !
You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life! <+++++> I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre.
Oh, yes. <+++++> Insolent young cub!
Can you see? <+++++> Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
You idiot! You don't even know what you're fighting over! <+++++> My honor, that's what I'm fighting over. Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo. <+++++> That's right.
You know like in "The Wonder Twins" they share everything. <+++++> The cartoon?
No. The owners are in Australia. <+++++> But where did you come from?
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles. <+++++> This isn't a request.
Twenty. <+++++> Forty.
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything? <+++++> Yes... It's magic.
Where? <+++++> The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
Who are you? <+++++> My name is Kazim.
How long have you known Hoagie? <+++++> What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?
I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four. <+++++> What's wrong now?
That was Dr. Judd. He was phoning to say that, Jacqueline is on her way here - <+++++> Gregory ÂÂ  you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
Look kid, you married that woman against my advice -- <+++++> -- What advice? You never --
Don't pull the green wire. Pull anything but the green wire. <+++++> Fuck you.
You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway. <+++++> What are you talking about?
Don't you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys? <+++++> Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try? Asshole.
What a sweet little picture. Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch! <+++++> Well, if that's the way you f...
"At the center of the investigation are well-known Washington-area attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks." <+++++> Yeah...look--
Did I kill her? <+++++> I don't think so.
Oh, come on. It's early. <+++++> Where are we?
Hruphh...? <+++++> Mr. Wood, this is Mr. Reynolds, your landlord. Could you please open up?
Well? <+++++> They come. They come and pushed me off.
Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off. <+++++> I have to get back.
I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind. <+++++> Why?
You'll get to meet them all tomorrow. They're...survivors. In a way. All severely sleep disordered. Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting... <+++++> But nightmares are the common thread?
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that. <+++++> Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
That a fact. Now, is it a good play? <+++++> Yes, Maude, it is. It is a <u>very</u> good play.
We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... <+++++> Wow.
You're making it up pretty good so far. <+++++> The minute we get a job, I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
...and you're going to do that? <+++++> Yes.
Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work. <+++++> Then foreclose!
I don't know. <+++++> I adore things like that....food I can't do without. Don't you?
Just what? <+++++> Just me, I suppose... I'm restless. I can't help it.
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226. <+++++> Have you used this type before?
Hey, what are you doing? ! <+++++> I know a short-cut.
Why do you think she did it? <+++++> Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
I can't. <+++++> Why do you have to go?
I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail. <+++++> You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing? <+++++> 
Just get me outta here. <+++++> Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through. <+++++> You think. That's what you're good at.
What? <+++++> Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice. <+++++> It's your play.
Not here. I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again. We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together. For your safety. <+++++> You'll call me then?
We've also been informed that the Grand Jury is going to call for an investigation into your affairs. <+++++> Why?
Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green... <+++++> Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is no such thing as safe. We have to get back in this plane...
Don't... <+++++> What was I supposed to think happened to you? !
No. <+++++> Of course not. He wouldn't be.
I'm leaving, too. <+++++> But, Eve, I would--
Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast. <+++++> Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
You sure? <+++++> I'm positive.
No, Elden, I need to... <+++++> You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's...
Medical clinic? <+++++> Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
What are you doing here? <+++++> Can we talk?
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared. <+++++> The ships?
Good God, ya'll! <+++++> No! You hate me. Look, I'm gonna do it one time. That's it.
Kind of a sign, you're saying. <+++++> In a sense.
Do you know who put it there? <+++++> No.
What? <+++++> I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
I liked you better frozen. You didn't talk so much. <+++++> You're damn lucky, glimpsing this country before it's ruined, gone for good. You saw wonders you'd only dreamed of.
I missed you. I wondered if you were ever coming back. <+++++> Me too.
No! <+++++> Er ... pray tell me why?
I don't like this. <+++++> It'll be all right. Trust me. And keep your eyes open. You wait here.
Tom, this is our case. <+++++> . . . What?
Um, well... <+++++> Are you lying to me?
In a railroad accident many years ago. <+++++> I was afraid to ask.
Hey? <+++++> Those audition tapes I sent out... I've been hired by your network for the Washington bureau. So I'll probably see you at work. Sorry.
....what....? <+++++> I was wondering if it's better to ask your girlfriend for the money? It could be really easy.
If I...you know... <+++++> What? Whatever you want, Helen!
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms. <+++++> I said when I think about you, I get wet.
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning. <+++++> Good morning, sir.
And I never will -- you know what's between us -Â we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition. <+++++> Clo-Clo?
We're on after Meadowlark. What's wrong? <+++++> Are you kidding me? Are you fucking kidding me?
The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one. <+++++> If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important.
So? <+++++> Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow? ! <+++++> What are you -
He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money... <+++++> 'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
Don't think about it. It's over. <+++++> It's never over... Here comes another six years of bad dreams.
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public. <+++++> Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance. <+++++> Yeah.
Jesus, Caesar! <+++++> What? It ain't no big fuckin' deal. I know who Don hires. Did you know he did time himself?
You ever get 'em? <+++++> Well, I think I had one once.
You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart. <+++++> Murman!
Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back? <+++++> From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland. <+++++> I think that's a good idea.
How do you know what my father thought - - <+++++> Your father loved me. He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy.
Adam -- <+++++> There's no time -- I'll call you in the morning.
I can't even take a shower here. <+++++> Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
What do you think? <+++++> What do you mean?
Maxwell. <+++++> I see the rewards of achievement have come your way.
You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip. <+++++> I just don't think she liked me in that way.
You got me something? What's the occasion? <+++++> You deserve it is the occasion.
Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady. <+++++> Mr. Brady's a cop.
Yesterday yes, today no. What happened last night? <+++++> Transfer me, suspend me. Just leave me alone.
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep. <+++++> All right, but...I'm going to check on you.
What happened afta that? <+++++> 
Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident. <+++++> Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
Well... I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's. <+++++> Hey, that's great, Henry! Good thinking!
You're father was Marvin Mitchell.. <+++++> Yes sir.
I'm so sorry. I'm a coward -- <+++++> I should have told you sooner --
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking. <+++++> Well, it's a tricky turn.
I'm telling you, it's the suits! <+++++> Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them. It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
What do you mean, Barton? <+++++> Not big in the sense of large Â although it's that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done.
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me. <+++++> I can see that.
We have to stick with the plan. <+++++> Stick?
Are you sure? <+++++> I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel. The address is 1921 North East 23. It's under your name. <+++++> And what's the mysterious code word?
Hey Charlie. <+++++> Hey Rob.
What did you find? <+++++> Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information.
Oh. <+++++> My wife's Jewish. But that probably doesn't matter right now.
I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots. <+++++> Don't make this a joke, Rafe. You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
Thank you, Bernie. Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise? <+++++> Nice surprise.
I don't mean to drop in unannounced ...you ready... <+++++> Soon as I get over the heart attack...
No, you can't die of insomnia. <+++++> Maybe I died already. Look at my face.
I'm just temporarily off my game. <+++++> You need to believe in something besides yourself.
It is intuitively obvious. <+++++> Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
You'll never believe who's in there. <+++++> It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
Christ, you're right -- Gray makes Jerry Ford look like Mozart. Just have Helms call him. Helms can scare anybody. <+++++> The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
Ruby was just given a new trial. If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald? <+++++> Negative on his tax records. Classified. First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.
I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies... <+++++> What are you talking about?
It's early for him. <+++++> That's all right, we're not meant to do Oh tonight. Something is going to happen. I can feel it.
Yes, David... <+++++> Will you help me to find out what camp they sent my father to?
Wow. Thank you. <+++++> No. Thank you.
As long as there's a pile-up, we can do our bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal from the contest. <+++++> It's a technique Ugly John and I worked out in case something like this came up.
Careful how you point that gun, boy. <+++++> Or what? OR WHAT?
What? <+++++> If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy.

We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis. <+++++> Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest? <+++++> It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.

Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money. <+++++> And? What are you saying?
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him! <+++++> I think I should go home.
Yes. Definitely. Definitely. Please, God. <+++++> Well, there it is, isn't it? You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them. What's that all about?
You shaved. <+++++> Yeah. Look bad?
Not about coming to see Daitz? <+++++> Not yet. Not about this, either.
A few million at the very most. The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus. <+++++> You think someone else caused the accident?
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play! Is that clear? Is that clear! <+++++> Yes sir.
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago. <+++++> And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
What alibi? <+++++> I can't tell you.
So I been told. <+++++> It's for your own good.
What? <+++++> What do you mean, "you"?
What're you talking about? <+++++> Something came up. Don't worry, Charlie stayed true. Both nights. I'll give you your share tomorrow. At the house.
As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy. <+++++> Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
Oh shit. What is that? <+++++> A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
Is what true? <+++++> He wears a disguise.
I'm sorry ... <+++++> No, no ... Come on in.
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me. <+++++> Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
She's very pretty, your mother. <+++++> Yes.
Is he straight? <+++++> You got the parole, didn't you?
Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA? <+++++> You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
And we're running out of that. <+++++> There's still tomorrow morning.
Ahh! Ah! <+++++> I'm sorry. I didn't do it! Can I still have my dog?
I finished all the interviews. <+++++> Let me see the files.
And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning. <+++++> Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
Oh, impressive wingspan. Very good! <+++++> Oh, what?!...What?! These are plastic. He can't fly!
What? <+++++> She's worried about you. And, quite frankly, so am I.
Do it for YOU. <+++++> Okay, okay... okay? I just... you know I hate surprises.
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there. <+++++> But <u>we</u> let him out.
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me? <+++++> Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
You said you were Klingman. <+++++> You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper. <+++++> Sure he is.
Boeman don't. You know I'm right. <+++++> Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
Can I at least have a drink? <+++++> It's ten thirty in the morning.
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake. I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you? <+++++> Dan, are you really that paranoid? Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school. <+++++> I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
What makes you think I won't turn us around? <+++++> Because you, too, must know.
Can you keep a secret? <+++++> Yes.
You know Elena, I've been thinking-- <+++++> Ben, maybe no talking right now? If you start talking, you're going to--
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you. <+++++> You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you. Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
No, thanks, man. We got to head out. <+++++> Come, now. You just got here.
What if I don't pay ya, Bert? <+++++> You don't pay me? You gonna get your thumbs broken. And your fingers.
Cloning from What?! Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand! <+++++> Not without massive sequence gaps!
Raise 500. <+++++> See ya and raise three.
Plumb busted out. Looks like the hard road finally got to Mister Lucas War Hero. <+++++> Back at it in the mornin'. Just need a little nap...
So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music. <+++++> Good school! And your family doesn't object to your career?
Casey. She's my only friend. <+++++> What about me?
Call me later. <+++++> You sure you want me to?
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning. <+++++> Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
What are you talking about? <+++++> I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
He's all yours. <+++++> Are you okay?
I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses... <+++++> And?
The other one? <+++++> The one in your mind. The one that you see on a bright cold morning.
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do? <+++++> Five times.
What? <+++++> Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
Hello? <+++++> <i>We gotta go to work, Domino.</i>
Can I go day after tomorrow? <+++++> Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
How soon? <+++++> Soon... It's too bad because they're very friendly as you can see. I've grown quite attached to them... This way.
Of course. <+++++> Do you love her?
Otis! <+++++> I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
We're still in Earth orbit. <+++++> On screen.
I have a purpose. <+++++> Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
And those lies she's been telling? <+++++> Lies?
Where are you? <+++++> Right beside you. I borrowed Viktor's car.
Good night? <+++++> Not particularly.
The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic Â writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are.. <+++++> Who am I?
Electra -- <+++++> What?
Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question? <+++++> Yea, James.
Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else. <+++++> The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
Why are you telling me this? <+++++> I'm telling you this because... we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel.
Honey, what is it? Just tell me. <+++++> I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew! The point is, you have a lot of the signs. <+++++> You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
How do you write women so well? <+++++> I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.
Working at Woolworths. <+++++> That must be interesting.
Which ranch? <+++++> How's that?
Get off that. That leads nowhere. You should offer condolences to the families of those kids. <+++++> Sure, I'd like to offer condolences.
What do you do for a living? <+++++> My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old. They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched. <+++++> You guys are crazy. You know that? I mean you guys are really nuts.
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject. <+++++> Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to the ocean?
Hundreds! Which one is your pet? <+++++> Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
Yes. Under two conditions. <+++++> What're those?
Jake... <+++++> It's OK.
A delivery device for nicotine. <+++++> A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
You're saying "me." <+++++> Yes. Twenty-five hundred apiece. One night's work, and the job with Graff. Working the premium leads.
Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson? <+++++> Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around. I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me. <+++++> They want me...bad. Or at least they don't want me grabbed up by the Chinese or whoever.
Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here. <+++++> Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?
What was it? <+++++> You know her, Jimmy?
That's right. And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river! <+++++> So they've been destroyed?
-- But he does seem very nice. <+++++> You think so?
Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew. <+++++> I don't know anything about it.
So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh? <+++++> 
Are you asking me a question? <+++++> Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms?
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning. <+++++> He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag... <+++++> Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
Any other bags, Dr. Johnson? <+++++> Just that. Careful, it's heavy.
I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight? <+++++> Yes. I do.
 <+++++> Spit from your dad?
I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey. <+++++> I was pushing as fast as I could.
Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name. <+++++> Thank you, son.
Aw, please Junebug? <+++++> No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
I think you have your answer. <+++++> War it is.
You want my heart? <+++++> It is my only object.
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew. <+++++> He wasn't. I can feel it.
Understood. I just wish I was doing more to help out. <+++++> I'll come to you when I need you.
Loretta, I can't marry you. <+++++> WHAT?
Your call is come through. <+++++> Far out. Larry? It's Fletch. Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm.
Because I don't want to see him hurt. <+++++> Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding. I want you to go back to him.
Still married, Jake? <+++++> Nope.
Yeah. <+++++> How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
Why are you doing this? <+++++> Because I want to.
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance. <+++++> What's the password?
If you must. <+++++> We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively.
You don't mean that. <+++++> Yeah. I mean that.
Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island. <+++++> Gasparilla?
You were never my guest? ! <+++++> That's right.
Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin' back. <+++++> Bull.
Am I quite strange to you? <+++++> Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you.
That's him! That's the sucker! ! <+++++> Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
No problem. If I can ask one question. <+++++> Fine. One.
It's okay...you're going to be okay. <+++++> I want to go home. I want off this ship.
Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme. <+++++> Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful. <+++++> Well--I am Madame Colet.
She was a witch. <+++++> No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
Would you? <+++++> If you're asking my opinion, no. I'd read it to Greer over the phone. Ask him if he had any objections.
He called the day he escaped. <+++++> He did? I don't remember. Did he say about me? In the trunk?
Where? <+++++> Government. Recently retired.
But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed. <+++++> Bela, he talk. Loretta, she talk. But Tor, he no talk.
Oh, come on - you can do better than that. <+++++> I met one of them.
If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it. <+++++> I have no intention of getting used to it.
But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying. <+++++> Dying?
What are you doing here? <+++++> I'm lost.
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once. <+++++> It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
Of course I can. Drink or she dies. Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going. <+++++> Let her go.
So what's the point? <+++++> Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.
...And you had to kill him? <+++++> No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
How old are ya? <+++++> ...What?
I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living. <+++++> Wait, I'm getting some fucked up feedback off that earpiece --
I heard you playing. <+++++> I often do.
Can it be that you want your brother found? <+++++> Anything is possible.
Could we hear God? <+++++> Mmm, that's a good one. Maybe his echo... Okay, no more stalling.
Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing. <+++++> Stop what?
Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain. <+++++> Do you feel that way now?
Uh-huh. <+++++> And if you had to guess ...
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid. <+++++> I like it.
What else? <+++++> Trust me.
It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar. <+++++> You don't say.
Look. Go on, look. <+++++> At what, exactly?
You know what your problem is? You're just too adorable... <+++++> You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight. <+++++> I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave.
I need a man who knows where I am. <+++++> I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands. <+++++> You leave my glands alone!
But I'll have cocktails with you. <+++++> When?
But he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>. On <i>us</i>. Everyone's talking about it. <+++++> He's just rattling your cage.
Yes. That is to sayÂ <+++++> Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
I'm sorry, sir. A year ago there was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso. This is the new Hotel Paraiso. <+++++> Take us there.
What do you suggest? <+++++> I donÂt know. EveryoneÂs dead...
This gentleman or myself ? <+++++> No, sir.
Great. Give me a grant. <+++++> I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me.... <+++++> Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is. What did they....
You know I can't make that promise. <+++++> Goodbye, Clarice...  You looked - so very lovely today, in your blue suit.
Spanish wasn't hard enough? <+++++> I thought it would be good to know.
And your head is hot. <+++++> That's ridiculous.
What about them? <+++++> There are none.
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass. <+++++> This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid!
That's a lie, Lieutenant... Anybody that says that is a liar. <+++++> Want to take a poke at him?
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning. <+++++> Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes.
That's just another part of the price to pay. <+++++> Santos... You kill that Sailor, otherwise he's gonna turn my baby against me.
She's not with you? <+++++> Who.
Who's in command? <+++++> I am, I think.
What's your problem with Crippled Dick? <+++++> Look around, this place is a dump! Naw, it'd have to work to be a dump.
Take good care of it. <+++++> Count on it.
What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip? <+++++> Wait -- I must figure it up.
Committee, huh? <+++++> Committee.
I certainly hope not. <+++++> Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
I'll get the girl. <+++++> Nah, don't bother --
How the hell are we gonna get outta here? <+++++> We'll think of something.
I don't want to talk about it. <+++++> Intriguing. I see. Would you like to know my crime?
Do I have to? <+++++> Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
It's video. <+++++> Even better. Wayne call your station, tell 'em we're going live a little early today. Make it happen!
There's other things to be learned. <+++++> Izzat so?
I don't care, Philip. You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead. Just watch out for those buck teeth. <+++++> Barbara <u>Zelman</u>? I don't believe this!
You're chasing a dream. <+++++> Just get me some horses.
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams? <+++++> Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself.
If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering? <+++++> A good question. And a simple answer. No more hunger. No more smog. No more overpopulation. No more war.
Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married? <+++++> And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
Will you read it for me? <+++++> "Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear.
What? <+++++> I'm just a bit of a wreck. "I sleep in your hat" makes me cry. Me.
I made it. <+++++> What are you talkin' about?! I'm the one drivin'!
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth. <+++++> So could you. But our records were a little against us.
I'm going home Cynthia. <+++++> Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
They're going to come and visit you in here? <+++++> Yes... that's what I pray for...!
Lemme go! I didn't go to do it! <+++++> Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet! <+++++> I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'.
So I, you know, I won't go to the opera. <+++++> You know, there's no reason for panic. I just want to rule out some things.
Ya owe me twenty-five bucks. <+++++> What for?
Just take it slowly. <+++++> Oh, sod you.
Are you embezzling? <+++++> "Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
Oh, no -- no! <+++++> That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
I see... a fox <+++++> Close. Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and swift.
You know what they say about men who need big guns... <+++++> Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
Well, well. Small world, isn't it? <+++++> Very... So, who you working for these days Eric?
You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can't betray his friends. What kind of pirate is that? <+++++> The worst.
What else? <+++++> That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
Yes, dear. Come on now. Bobby, your shoes are soaking! <+++++> Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship -- <+++++> Which was?
But she must want to stand. She must want to walk. <+++++> Confound me, the child's a cripple, of course she wants to walk.
This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it. <+++++> Yes.
I see the world. <+++++> Is it night or day, Erik?
What? Wait a minute - <+++++> That's not all. According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'. <+++++> Paulie, please --
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange? <+++++> I have always thought about her and missed her.
I'd kill the last wolf on earth, right in front of the President of the U.S.  Stinking, cowardly predator, the wolf. <+++++> 89   CONTINUED:
Yeah? <+++++> And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up.
Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room. <+++++> When I told you what every young actress should know.
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac. <+++++> Maybe we should all get on it.
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives. <+++++> It's your best play, Nicky.
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you. <+++++> Why do you say that?
Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me. <+++++> The Senators admire you.
Into the Hudson? <+++++> Uh-huh.
Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry. <+++++> No hard feelings.
So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading - <+++++> Want an animal cracker?
How many did you lose? <+++++> Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel with dual-groove, parallel rifling, elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer. <+++++> The Army gave you that?
Are you okay? <+++++> Yeah, I'm fucking fantastic.
...what have you <u>done</u> to me... <+++++> All Combat takes place at night, in the Rain, and at the Junction of four Map Segments...
It's bad. I'm a bad person. But I try not to be, Terri. I really do. And I really miss you. <+++++> I miss you too.
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesnÂt appeal to you... <+++++> Is that where lawyers toil for an industry that turns serial killers into heroes who give thrills to young women who write erotic novels about psychopaths and rapists?
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here. <+++++> Where is everybody?
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores. <+++++> Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
Ya don't say. <+++++> Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
Stay away from my family! <+++++> Too late, your kid worships me. And your wife -- she's an animal. Even I can't keep up with her.
Be careful. <+++++> I'm trying.
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc. <+++++> Leave me alone!
You mean you'd like me to do it, huh? <+++++> Well, I was thinking thatÂYeah, you know, sort of break the ice.
If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear? <+++++> Sir, yes, sir!
This is the Nexus? <+++++> For you. This is where you wanted to be.
So you lost the job. Is that what you're telling me? He just up and fired you? <+++++> It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
Lisa, simmer down -- will you? <+++++> You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
Afraid so. <+++++> That's a big book you're writing.
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school? <+++++> Uh-huh.
Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself. God willing. <+++++> An apartment uptown? Downtown?
He was full of pep. Must've had his grande latte enema. <+++++> Here are your flight coupons. Call me from the road if there are any snags. Your itinerary...
Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything. <+++++> I told the D.A. everything I know.
No! <+++++> Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram! Em iram!
Not today, Burgel. Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today. <+++++> 
I don't believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy... <+++++> I'm going to sleep it off. Let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
The workers don't get on? <+++++> Get on? They detest each other. Obviously the Africans hate the Indians. But the Indians also hate the other Indians.
Eh. <+++++> Great. Great. So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me.
It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing. <+++++> But how will I ever know, Louis?
You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me. <+++++> It's not quite the same thing.
Jesus Christ... <+++++> We're rising.
Oh, come nowÂ <+++++> He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.
What? <+++++> No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything. It's just I don't dream. Never have.
Tell me, Vincent. Do you believe in Santa Claus? <+++++> Can't say that I do.
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist. <+++++> No one ever said you were, Mitch.
You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves. <+++++> Okay. Good idea. You first.
The strike is a success; but ... <+++++> No. It has failed in its objective.
 <+++++> Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation? <+++++> I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
I said I want the truth. <+++++> She's my sister and my daughter!
Behind my house, up on the ridge. <+++++> If we go and look and there's nothing there, you'll have to admit to me that this is all in your mind.
Eve. <+++++> Eve?
How? <+++++> Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
Why? <+++++> Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters.
We're only talking about six weeks. <+++++> Will you be here?
Sorry, Dick. She's a little tipsy. <+++++> You mean smashed! She called up at midnight last week. Talking a bunch of crap. Pat can't stand her.
Just missed Deleon. Hayes is up in the squad. <+++++> Where's the collar, in the cells?
Please. I said I don't want you to do this. <+++++> Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
I know I can capture it. <+++++> Kathryn, you're crazy. Really crazy. A suicidal maniac.
Abduction? <+++++> I don't buy the whole recluse scam. How are you doing it? What is it -- drugs? Blackmail? Mind-control? All three?
Nothing. Good night. <+++++> Good night.
Really? <+++++> Yeah.
Picking out my wedding dress! <+++++> What? !
Why didn't you tell me about this? <+++++> You have enough to worry about, Angelo. You don't need my problems.
Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella. <+++++> Does he win?
The case! <+++++> Oh. One more thing. This is personal. I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of -- <+++++> Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
Ellie -- I'm getting married. Her name's Laura. She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left. <+++++> You sonofabitch.
Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...? <+++++> Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?! ?
He won't be looking for you. Just be careful. Buy a book. Keep your sunglasses on. <+++++> Book. Sunglasses. Great.
What? Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets? <+++++> No, Neo. I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
But you invited is aboard. <+++++> Your cannons made a compelling argument.
And what can he do for you? <+++++> Can the maker repair what he makes?
I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning. <+++++> Good idea.
Yes. <+++++> And where did you sit that morning?
And when my father was Sheriff? <+++++> What about it?
Same. <+++++> Such a pretty day. If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this. Mind you I'm 74 now.
Where did you stop last? <+++++> What the hell do you think you're doing?
I am not! Fuck you! Theo's a genius. <+++++> Any trouble, we whip out our Treasury Department badges -- show them the wire I'm wearing and read them their rights.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy. <+++++> Was he the president?
You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right. <+++++> I'm not studying no Mayor. Besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples. My tenants and my ex- husband--Goddamn-bless his soul.
Sure. By shooting at me. <+++++> Even that could be a trick.
Looking for Crash Davis. <+++++> Ain't here.
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna. <+++++> But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different!
I'm still having trouble with English. <+++++> The man and the woman are married --
As what? A Nazi stooge like you? <+++++> Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world.
I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break. <+++++> Oh, for pity's sake...
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home? <+++++> Sure. Sure, Sal. We're going home.
As you wish. <+++++> Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed. <+++++> Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
I'm Kate. You must be Cledus. <+++++> Yes, ma'am.
"There's more light here," he says-- <+++++> Drunks are funny--
When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first? ! <+++++> Nick, what are you --
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press! <+++++> Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne.
Jail! Listen, Bubber... This is crazy. We could fall off of here. <+++++> You should go in. You're risking your life again...
Don't talk. <+++++> Take your time... one day at a time, kid...
What are you talking about? <+++++> When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you.
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was. <+++++> No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
What year do you think it is? <+++++> 1995?
We should be dead. We didn't decompress. <+++++> Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.
Yeah... okay... he did <+++++> And then what... he touched you? Did you maybe flirt a little...
You're a considerate young man. <+++++> You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.
Shouldn't you lie down? <+++++> When I'm dead--  or fucking.
What? <+++++> Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?
I was lookin' at it. I saw you, man! Jesus! You oughta see yourself! You wouldn't believe it. <+++++> Yes, I would.
I'll pack my things and meet you downstairs. <+++++> And to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight...
Where'd they come from? <+++++> The front stairs.
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her? <+++++> Just find the girl.
Mr. Bixler,  I love you. <+++++> Oh, Vada...
What are you doing here? <+++++> It is the gathering, my friend. The settling of old scores.
Bye, Mom. <+++++> Don't forget your towel.
Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it? <+++++> Anybody could know that song.
You've got to help around the house! <+++++> But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red. <+++++> He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.
My ass ain't the same. <+++++> Bigger?
Bravo, Your Majesty! <+++++> Well done, Sire!
Who's Camille? <+++++> None of your business.
Faux goose down. <+++++> Still...
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow? <+++++> Yeah, I'll be in.
Yes. <+++++> ...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something. <+++++> It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
A blue rose. <+++++> Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad. <+++++> Than what?
It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know. <+++++> It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak -- <+++++> -- what...are...you...going...to --
Right. <+++++> You should take this seriously.
Okay, I'll give here the message. <+++++> Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
In the generator room again? <+++++> Oh, yes. It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
What sort of an animal is that? <+++++> It-it-it-it - it's a huge one!
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife. <+++++> If you're so happy with them, please, be my guest.
Whatcha wanna stop here for? Not that I ain't glad to be on the ground, y'understand. <+++++> Just a second.
Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings-- <+++++> Heh-heh--
It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch-- <+++++> --or one huge attack of group hysteria.
Not exactly. What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes. But you're inventing it yourself as you go along. <+++++> Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
Why? <+++++> I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
Let's forget who said what to whom... <+++++> You got a deal...
That was a great idea, Shorty. <+++++> I told you it would taste just like chicken.
Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John? <+++++> Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.
How did you end up on Remus? <+++++> They sent me there to die. How could a mere human survive the dilithium mines? It was... I was a slave. And a monster.
Horseshit. <+++++> No, she's right.
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him. <+++++> If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
Earth... But when?... Spock? <+++++> Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
You send telegrams here? <+++++> I'm just fine thanks, and how are you? To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing.
Vaaaat?? ? <+++++> Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time. This is a man of his time.
What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet. <+++++> That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.
--What? <+++++> Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
You did? <+++++> I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --
I'm wondering about the weather department. I'm wonderin' wether or not the weather people use outside meteorlogical services or if they have in-house instruments? <+++++> I can check on that for you, maybe we can take a tour --
What makes you think so? <+++++> My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
Nice job. <+++++> Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
What for? <+++++> You're real favorites of his.
I want it back. <+++++> What?
I only eat popcorn at the movies. <+++++> I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Thirty-five. <+++++> Not counting this week. You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
 <+++++> Come on now, chickie, why don't you go to bed...?
What! ? <+++++> With the priest, you liked them scrambled. With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.
They say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery. <+++++> Wow. I'm bad news.
Worms was comin' out. <+++++> Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long.
Ohh, right. Would you like a soda? <+++++> I would.
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ... <+++++> Still a bit chilly ...
The bogyman! <+++++> We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
What are you doing? <+++++> What have you left for me?
How you know that? <+++++> I can tell.
Yes. <+++++> And? Are you going to tell him?
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck. <+++++> What, you're afraid?
On my mother's side the Ardens <+++++> No, your marriage bed.
Hold up a minute... <+++++> You spend the afternoon in Bed?
Twelve. <+++++> 
Oh, God! <+++++> I am. You-you made my day.
Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been. <+++++> Then <u>where's the body</u>?
I don't believe he did it. <+++++> Why don't you?
So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life? <+++++> I have the feeling, they got it down already. They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
I don't need a lecture. I care about Michael. <+++++> Then that's even more reason to listen. Look, schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality. They experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes.
Picky, picky. <+++++> 
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse. You into something big? <+++++> Pretty much.
We're fine! How are you? <+++++> Grrrreat!
You should be an actor, Frank. You looked like you were really mad. The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch. <+++++> You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?
I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy." <+++++> Strike out, eh?
Yes, Sire. <+++++> Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
You didn't say serial killer and I didn't say serial killer. <+++++> Right.
--you'd go with him! <+++++> Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
"Hasta la vista, baby"? <+++++> Yeah, or "later, dickwad." Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out." Like that. Or you can do combinations.
Am I as good as they? <+++++> Hmmm - good coffee.
You need to say a bit more than that! <+++++> Oh... er... yes...
Who put the big hurt on... <+++++> ...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
I just tell it like it is, mister. If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me. <+++++> Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles?
He won't neither. He never has. <+++++> I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
Who was the girl you walked off with? <+++++> No one.
No rust? <+++++> I didn't say that. Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
78th. <+++++> Den less go Joe.
Forget it. I'll just go. <+++++> Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again? <+++++> Why don't you leave this town - go home?
Joe. <+++++> Bet your sweet ass we are.
What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy? <+++++> Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
Yes. Yes, come with me! <+++++> I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel. I'm coming with him.
Not on him, Chief. <+++++> Agent Hurley...
Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been? <+++++> What did you find out?
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go. <+++++> Leave Myers for the state boys.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us. <+++++> I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
It's orders! You remember... when they tell you to do something and then you do it. John Wayne is dead, man. <+++++> You take pictures and split. I'm going in.
I'm sorry. They live here, too? <+++++> No. They've passed on.
Not no more. <+++++> You can keep your will! I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
She's fine, as if you cared. <+++++> Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville?
Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that. <+++++> This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
Nothing. <+++++> How good's your intelligence?
Thanks so much for coming over. <+++++> Oh, I'm really glad you called.
Why? <+++++> I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned.
Dude, what are you doing here? <+++++> You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood. You've killed an icon, for God's sake. <+++++> I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
It's hot in here. <+++++> It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
Besides, you hired me for my discretion. <+++++> YouÂve always got that to hide behind, donÂt you? ItÂs just business!
Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck. <+++++> Thanks.
Did you hear that strange music? <+++++> What?
What say we get the hell out of here, Ellen Brody. ... <+++++> Get her started....
They said go see the chaplain. <+++++> I'm sorry but I have to go.
Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it... <+++++> Yeah, sure, I guess...
What? I just said hello. Since when I can't kiss my sister-in-law? <+++++> Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
Green? Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather <+++++> I don't know his first name.
Who told you that? <+++++> Mrs...
 <+++++> You ol' sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn't have nothin' to worry about.
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone. <+++++> Gone where?
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember? <+++++> Johnny, I know, but...
You're sure it was the Hilton? <+++++> At the airport.
Is your Evian spiked? <+++++> We should do it.
We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case. <+++++> I'm not going near any lifeboat!
Ten is standard, sir. <+++++> Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
How's that? <+++++> Let them go. And I'll leave ...
You always go with Andy. <+++++> How was dive class?
Because you're nuts. <+++++> Right, right -- Isn't she fun to tease?
Whatever you like. I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you. Are you alright, Clair? <+++++> I'm fine. I'm fine. Well, I'm a little stressed.
What's up? <+++++> I've been trying to find you all day.
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it. <+++++> The inspiration.
I like your nails. Where did you get them done? <+++++> Ah... I do them myself. I used to work in a beauty parlor.
Yes sir. <+++++> Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right.
How can you look at it so clinically? <+++++> Take your average cop. They deal with death everyday. If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared. <+++++> Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road. <+++++> Which leads us to...
Yeah? Is that an embarrassing question? Should I have not asked it? <+++++> Probably not.
Care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program? <+++++> Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot! <+++++> Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
Yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as I've said... <+++++> ...get me a cigarette.
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there. <+++++> Hell, they hardly even noticed us.
And to think -- they met at a key party of all things. <+++++> A key party?
Well? <+++++> Yeah.
I can read it to you. <+++++> You mean, again?
At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE! Why can't you? <+++++> We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere. <+++++> How did you get your hand out?
All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good. <+++++> I feel good anyways.
What the fuck did you do with my stuff? <+++++> Don't use language with me --
Okay, let's backtrack, try to pick up his trail. You know the kid out on the pipeline that Wilder's buddies with? <+++++> We were just talking about him.
Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl. <+++++> They is!? It shore is good to see you, boy!
No. No. Cut. -- Justine, we agreed. No questions about the Watchmen. <+++++> Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
Maybe you did it yourself. <+++++> Why?
Yes. Is he there? <+++++> You are a friend of his?
What are you doing? <+++++> The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged.
How did she get that idea? <+++++> I think I gave it to her.
What's his name? <+++++> Zowie.
No. <+++++> Fine! Eat in the cupboard.
A bad idea. <+++++> I got us through the War all right.
I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper. <+++++> What a dump...
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen. <+++++> Have you been reading what Minister Jefferson has to say? If he had his way, all our slaves would be freed no matter what the outcome.
Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today. <+++++> No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
So many assholes, so few bullets. <+++++> Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
Does this bother you, Mr. Cole? <+++++> No! Look, I don't belong here! What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to. <+++++> There's a lot of things I don't see any sense to. But make up your mind.
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you! <+++++> I don't think so.
With spittle? <+++++> I've poisoned you. HAROLD  Lucretia Borgia? Something I drank or touched? You refused a cigar. That's it! Potassium cyanide in the humidor!
Tell me something, Stamp. Tell me this one thing. How much is a nigger supposed to take? <+++++> All he can. All he can.
I don't believe it! <+++++> Then why are you afraid to let me prove it?
I mean, romantically. <+++++> Uh-huh. Well, but if --
You're the kid who was home schooled. <+++++> Yeah. How'd you know?
Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him? <+++++> I'm not interested in him.
They are at the gates of Paris, sire. <+++++> And where is the army?
Forget it. <+++++> Excuse me?
How about the nudity? <+++++> Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank. For me, clothes are just an option.
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you? <+++++> I'd like that.
I looked at them. They're shrubs, small trees. Exquisite. And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane. <+++++> I was talking about the girl.
No. I saw her with Tod. <+++++> Do you know where she lives?
Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter. <+++++> Oh, hello. I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
I'm gonna go to her wake. <+++++> No, you're not.
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it. <+++++> It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
Yeah. <+++++> You're with me now.
I don't think the color of the interior is.... <+++++> Rose this not the place to be having this...
Good thinking. <+++++> You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
No. They hired Bain. The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one. <+++++> So this is something between you and him?
You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was. <+++++> It wasn't a trick!
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing. I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's. <+++++> Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
I was driving by -- I saw all the cars. Are you all right? <+++++> Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night.
All right. How much is Pepsi here? <+++++> A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
What's that one, there? <+++++> Tattoo. Had it taken off.
Brad, please lets get out of here. <+++++> For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
Why not? <+++++> Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did. You think they're gonna let me write pictures?
You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town! <+++++> Crawl!
She bit you? <+++++> Bit, scratched. But I had her pinned. She calmed down.
I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air? <+++++> Do me a favor, will you? Spare me, for God's sake. Get in the real world. What do you think?
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin? ! <+++++> No honey.
You don't know him very well, do you? <+++++> He's my father.
Oh. When are they expected home? <+++++> I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
Gently. <+++++> At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
What about your husband? <+++++> I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town.
He's in Palermo. <+++++> What's wrong can never be made right.
This will relax her. <+++++> She's underage.
Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions? <+++++> Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
I didn't do nothing wrong! That was Mayolia's! I didn't ask her for it. I don't know about any - <+++++> Yeah yeah yeah - look! I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me!
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women. <+++++> Why?
You're amazing. You figured this all out already? <+++++> Hey, business is business. You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference?
Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around. <+++++> Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this? <+++++> What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
Thought you hate your old man. <+++++> Five years, Nicky. Five years. I just want to go home.
You know who the mayor was? <+++++> No.
Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you? After all we've been through? <+++++> Yeah. Some of it was fun.
It's okay. <+++++> No, I don't belong here.
You're OK by me. <+++++> Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
It's okay. <+++++> Yeah?
After we're outside the kogus? <+++++> Oh we... we...
If you come out to the track, don't know me. <+++++> We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
Something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining. <+++++> Honey, some folks just can't fly.
Andy? <+++++> That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house. <+++++> I'd wish for a puppy.
Mr. Davis seems a good prospect ÂÂyoung handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - - <+++++> What if he is?
What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us. <+++++> Yeah. Bad luck. Good-bye, Cobb.
Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it. <+++++> 
NO! <+++++> I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!
Were his parents...attentive to him? <+++++> What do you mean?
You figure! <+++++> Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.
My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter? <+++++> Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
Hi. I'm Todd Aubochon. <+++++> Greetings fellow insomniac.
I just had a mental picture of... <+++++> Here, pick these up!
We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities. Then we will both be free.] <+++++> It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
I'm mad at you. <+++++> Go have fun. Not too much.
Work! Don't say that word, man. <+++++> Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
Nick! Nick, you'll kill him!... Easy. Nick, easy! Hey, hey. Vince goes back a long way. <+++++> Yeah.
What did I 'get?' <+++++> Yeah. What vibe?
Spock... Did braking thrusters fire? <+++++> They did, Admiral.
Uh, yes I am. And you are? <+++++> Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
The time wasn't right. <+++++> You're out in the desert, the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles, and you say the time wasn't right?
How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here! <+++++> Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
Damn it! <+++++> I didn't even see them fire!
She's a charmer, you'll see. In fifty years, the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you. <+++++> Stop. You're making me insecure.
Well... <+++++> ...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her.
There's something else I would like you to help me with. <+++++> Name it.
Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard. I have no wish to go riding. <+++++> I'm very sorry, ma'am. I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.
She's a girl of so many rare qualities. <+++++> So she seems.
And the next one...? <+++++> From Carl Heine's boat. All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops. Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow. <+++++> The park?
You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been? <+++++> I finished it off.
But where did you get it, Amy? <+++++> At the old house with the voice.
What do you think, George, shall I resign? It's what they want. <+++++> Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict.
For this one, we need $60,000. <+++++> That's all?? That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
Here -- Three minutes. <+++++> Yeah -- My ol' man who was never the sharpest told me -- I weren't born with much brain so I better use my body.
Go on, tell me! Speak for Him! <+++++> My son, no one can speak for God.
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money. <+++++> What for? To play Fats again?
It will? <+++++> Uh-huh.
You know what that proves? <+++++> What, Mr. De Santis?
Twelve years. <+++++> How did you get together?
What's happening? <+++++> He's close...
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes. <+++++> Good. He never doubted you.
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at. <+++++> So you say. I'd like to hear her side of it.
 <+++++> I'm really only equipped to take orders --
Thanks for not judging me. <+++++> It's not my place.
Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs. <+++++> Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any STEREO!
All you do is profit from another man's misery! <+++++> You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv.
There's no lights back there. <+++++> I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
What's she got to do with it? <+++++> She's going with me.
Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth." <+++++> What does that mean?
Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute. <+++++> Okay, sure.
What little old man? <+++++> That little old man.
Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter? <+++++> Doesn't sound very exciting.
Yes. We can pray. <+++++> Good idea...
...aren't you afraid of me...? <+++++> You want me to be?
What's got into you? <+++++> Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
Uh-oh. <+++++> Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more. <+++++> Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit? <+++++> Thank you.
So... everything sounds... wonderful? <+++++> Yes, it is.
Why, yes. <+++++> Well --
What are you talking about? <+++++> I'm not worth risking your life for.
But what about the past? Our past? <+++++> We never really shared one.
Comrade. <+++++> Comrade Kopalski...
And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind. <+++++> Well, just take 't easy, man.
What's up? <+++++> Just wanted to say good game.
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much. <+++++> Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
I know. <+++++> Is it loaded?
Mom? <+++++> Yes?
Meaning? <+++++> Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Ted, we've only got ten minutes. <+++++> Not now, Elaine.
How much money have you got? <+++++> Heaven knows. A lot.
I mean...wow...off the charts great. <+++++> ItÂs an unbelievable thing. Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person. IÂm gonna buy it...
-Ellie said she died when I was BORN! She's been alive...? ALL THIS TIME...? Why have I been lied to when - <+++++> I had you sent away.
Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there wets his pants for fighters. Promised me the next spot he can wangle. <+++++> Impressive.
Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with. <+++++> Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night. <+++++> I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see? <+++++> Yes.
Is that the money? <+++++> Yeah, that's it.
You ain't actin', mama. <+++++> Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, ain't you got one cute mouth tonight?
Thank you, Captain Sulu. <+++++> Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
Plus where's Huggie Bear? <+++++> He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
We'd go to his car. <+++++> Oh no. In the car you did it?
You wouldn't believe me. <+++++> I would.
But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke. <+++++> Why do you say that?
Your mother's family is Spanish? <+++++> Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
Me, too. <+++++> Okay. Now, so he's in jail.
We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up. <+++++> Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going?
TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW EVERYTHING . <+++++> I don't know what you're talking about.
They're only lobsters. Look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster. <+++++> I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
Havanas. You're not the smoker. So who is? <+++++> You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour. I work for the best illusionist in the world.
FUCK YOU. YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE. <+++++> baby, please, please --
Bermuda. <+++++> Bermuda... Rich, eh?
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub. <+++++> Right.
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building. <+++++> Did anybody notice you?
I know how that can be. <+++++> 
Were you born in Mexico? <+++++> Cuba.
I'm just getting started.... <+++++> I don't want you in the water anymore....
Thank you, Lt. Saavik. <+++++> And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
I shouldn't have asked you to come. <+++++> You asked me not to come.
There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then... <+++++> Wait'll you see it.
Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car? <+++++> It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex... <+++++> Jail, you asshole! Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out! Bunny, Ball-Ball!
I love you, son! Don't ever think I don't love you! We gon' get to be friends? <+++++> Yes, Daddy! Yes!
Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me. <+++++> My god ... it's true. The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
What are you - <+++++> You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?! They think you went batshit!
Huh? <+++++> What are you doing here?
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten. <+++++> When he was around your age... almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca. <+++++> May we proceed with the business?
If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing. <+++++> I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk. <+++++> He told me he was turning in early...
That the old actress -- Julia Farren? <+++++> Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
What? <+++++> I'm lonely.
If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes. <+++++> Who're you kidding? You can so.
Prosit. <+++++> Prosit.
Like a Grateful Dead Concert. <+++++> Drugs begin pouring out of America into every other country in the world. Canada is completely overwhelmed.
Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something.... <+++++> You were a monkey....
Office of--Senator Smith? <+++++> *No*!
Could I stop you? <+++++> You don't drink like you used to.
Jail!? James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass. <+++++> I'd like to see you try.
You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake. <+++++> I'll never forget you said it.
Now, Jack. That reef is less than a league distant. It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better. <+++++> Someone needs to cut these bonds, then.
Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the back of my hand. <+++++> Look at your hand.
What are you doing? <+++++> What?
You don't have anywhere to stay? <+++++> I don't think so.
There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained. <+++++> Then be trained.
We'll be half-way down the road with the money. <+++++> I'd fucking kill you.
That's what the witnesses told him. <+++++> Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance. <+++++> Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
What do you see here? <+++++> Graffiti --
Just Klaatu. <+++++> The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel--
Just a manner of speech, sir. <+++++> Well, yes, it's just a manner of speech from your Post Corrective Advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex.
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago. <+++++> I'm sorry I'm late.
You're not even a hero. You're a scary, sick, fake who made a big mistake. You killed someone very special to me.. <+++++> And...your point?
Who was that? <+++++> Someone from the village.
Jesse? <+++++> Yeah whaddya want?.
I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here. <+++++> Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness?
Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil. <+++++> I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
I tried to keep things nice and civil, you know. But... hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits? That doesn't make much sense. <+++++> First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't.
Ye-es, Je-an? <+++++> Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
Skeleton keys never work. Anyway, this can wait. We'll get a crowbar later. Your mother... <+++++> Stepmother.
How many feet? <+++++> Er, well, twelve.
Extremely unfortunate maneuver. <+++++> The hell is that? What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Come on. <+++++> Hey!
Uh, no... I should be on the bridge. <+++++> Are you running away from me?
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it. Close your eyes. <+++++> That makes it harder still.
I just think you used to be bad. <+++++> No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign? <+++++> Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
No, Joe, in my judgment the only thing to do is push this Dam through--and get it over with. <+++++> Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it. <+++++> Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?
No -- <+++++> I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
But she stinks like a slut just the same. <+++++> Your ranch?
What? <+++++> You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.
Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here? <+++++> Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets? <+++++> Ok.  For another $5.00 a special on the packs.
 <+++++> Check out what I found.
And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what? <+++++> They turn their back on it. Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
Oh - in here. <+++++> Of course. On Thursdays, they always serve me in the small salon.
He's not... They feel he... maybe he might not recover, and that he'll either... <+++++> Don't tell me about this...
I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care. <+++++> Mama, I'm hangin' up this phone now.
That signal. It's a countdown. <+++++> A countdown to what?
You see? <+++++> Yes.
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . . <+++++> Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
What the fuck is going on? When did you get out of jail? <+++++> Pablo used his influence. Now, George, watch what you say. Everybody hears everything.
Lick me. <+++++> Where is it?
Crocodiles! Aah! <+++++> The sodding water table.
Call 911. <+++++> Shut up.
Tell me. What do the police say? <+++++> They're calling it an accident.
Lt. Thomas Quinn declares that the murders will be treated as unrelated crimes, unless new evidence... <+++++> You messed with the evidence.
My daughter. <+++++> What about her?
Aw, come, come, come -- <+++++> No, they won't - honestly.
Float me a hundred bucks. <+++++> Why?
Steve? <+++++> Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me. <+++++> True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
You can't have water after morphine. <+++++> Still playing by the rules. You're a damn good kiler.
Where is it! Please! <+++++> AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
You really got a Masters Degree? <+++++> Sure. I only sound like forty-year- old in your language.
... Oh? You've heard? <+++++> Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.
I thought only hookers drank those things. <+++++> Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk. <+++++> Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here.
It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama. <+++++> That is why they call it coach?
I hate parties -- <+++++> Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
Do you want to come and have a drink? <+++++> Oh ... that's awfully nice.
Su casa y shit-o hole-o. <+++++> Hey, hon'--this is what pays the rent and tuition.
Oh. <+++++> I had a checklist in mind. I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash.
Came to my senses. <+++++> Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
Sure. <+++++> I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me? <+++++> No, I just told you what happened.
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real. <+++++> If we're for real?
I guess you have to go on faith. <+++++> Some times...
Thank you. <+++++> And don't be shy about your English. You speak better than a lot of people I know. Take care of yourself.
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse." <+++++> Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
Today it has a value of $100,000. Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them. <+++++> You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur FÃ©lix -- are they for sale now?
A hundred bucks? That's ridiculous. <+++++> So's the job.
I'm lost. <+++++> -- Can't seem to escape you today.
I know you smoke weed, right? <+++++> Why you say that?
I don't fuckin' cook. <+++++> Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...
You like Chagall? <+++++> I do. It feels like how being in love should be. Floating through a dark blue sky.
What did the king say? <+++++> He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
Approaching point of origin. Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten. Five. Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission. <+++++> What's the terrain down there?
Uh huh, great. Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right? <+++++> Basically. The Skynet funding bill is passed. The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997. Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.
Whatcha doin' over here? <+++++> Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck. What's all that wood in there for?
I have. That's why I didn't call you first. <+++++> I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot.
Surprised to see me? <+++++> Take your boots off. You're tan.
Former Commander? <+++++> I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.
I want to know why you are the way you are! <+++++> And I'm telling you it's not any one thing that I can point to and say "That's why!"
Rachel, Jamie. Thank God! <+++++> What's going on?
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out. <+++++> Maybe we will. Nice meeting you.
Where's your gun? <+++++> Chest pocket. Shit!
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore? <+++++> Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
You can trust me, Judy. <+++++> I feel as if I'm walking under water.
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus? <+++++> He's dead.
God knows I tried. One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy. <+++++> Take me away...
I don't know. Eight or Nine. <+++++> I'll give you an eight.
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead... <+++++> You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once. <+++++> I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine.
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better -- <+++++> Excuse me?
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now. <+++++> Oh... are you... ?
How much for the phone calls? <+++++> It's nothing.
They were yellow! <+++++> You're color blind.
Keep saying what? <+++++> You're not digging.
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes. <+++++> Does Alyssa know?
What? <+++++> I'm too young to be so sick.
That's one way to put it. <+++++> I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
Why not? <+++++> I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
Then we smash 'em? <+++++> Anything left for smashing you may happily smash.
You wanna knock of f? <+++++> No, no. I'm fine. What did the Speaker say?
How did you get in? <+++++> The stairs from the street.
What are you going to do? <+++++> Finish what my son started.
How do you know? <+++++> Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us. <+++++> We're too young.
Of course. <+++++> You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down.
Lynch him! Lynch him! <+++++> Bluebeard!
Go to it, handsome. <+++++> See you.
Are you hungry? We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley. <+++++> Captain it would be impossible to turn down such a gracious request.
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra. <+++++> The scent you're wearing. I bought it for you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie. So many things.
My son Frank, he was married when he was nineteen years old. Watsa matter with you? <+++++> That's swell, Missus Fusari.
Jim...? <+++++> 
Good evening -- I'm sorry, Jabez -- I'm a little late. <+++++> No, you're not.
He's fine, as long as he gets his medication. <+++++> Speaking of that...  We're gonna need a whole lot <u>more</u> of this....
Saavik... My god, what happened to them? <+++++> It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing. <+++++> I did what you told me to.
Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me... <+++++> What are you doing here?
What do you actually know with religion? <+++++> Wonder. Beauty. Joy. Love.
They don't have a wine list. <+++++> Oh, then we will have the house wine.
What is it? <+++++> It's a voice modulator.
It's my mother's piano. <+++++> A piano?
And I can't blame you that it happened. You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her. <+++++> I was grieving too.
You're supposed to be my doctor, right? <+++++> That's right. I <u>am</u> your doctor.
What's dumb about it? <+++++> Well, you're doing so well...
No, it won't work and I just realized why. There's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. Only one of us could survive. <+++++> Yeah... I forgot.
She's down... <+++++> She's down...how do you mean honey?
The old man and woman called me... Phillippe. <+++++> Phillippe. Rest now.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses? <+++++> Max--
Good night, David. <+++++> Good night, Alex.
Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl. <+++++> Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl. You'll blow up. I know you're tired!
Did you try to fight him? <+++++> I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
Yeah I'll look into that tonight. <+++++> I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
Are you supposed to be here? <+++++> I've got you worried, haven't I?
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry. <+++++> No.
That's right. <+++++> Then I'm doing fine.
With all my heart. <+++++> Kiss me...?
Hi. How you doin'? <+++++> Okay.
In a way. <+++++> This isn't a game.
Before they were married? <+++++> I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of.
Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! <+++++> Sir, my leg is on fire!
Explain it... I told you. <+++++> Shoot him.
In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere. <+++++> That's why we came here, remember?
Perfect. All ginny. <+++++> Except itÂs Scotch.
Yo, whassup? <+++++> 
Yeah. I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her. <+++++> I'm sorry. I didn't realize... But she knew, John. A mother knows what's in her son's heart.
Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs? <+++++> Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?
Not to me. But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you? <+++++> Yes, Mr. Bernstein.
Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame. <+++++> Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
So what? You going to help me? <+++++> WILL YOU PLEASE... please listen to me ...  You know none of this is true -                           PARRY the Grail, the voices...                           Jack...
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun! <+++++> I hope you get your work done.
The other guests? <+++++> There are no other guests. We don't want to share this night with other people. This is for you and me.
How was school today? <+++++> Fine.
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son? <+++++> All right, Dad.
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya. <+++++> Yeah.
All right. No. That's nice. <+++++> If there's a train.
Yes. Something... conservative. <+++++> Yes...
why did they do that? <+++++> Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
What's the worst? <+++++> You get the girl.
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine. <+++++> Yes, sire?
And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect. <+++++> What you don't know about women is a lot.
Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life. When is your next picture coming out? <+++++> I have no next picture.
Talk about work? Never! <+++++> I meant did you find other stuff to --
Sulu's giving us his position and telling us he's standing by... <+++++> He's placing himself in a most awkward position...
It was the only way to solve certain problems -- <+++++> Did your collaborator know?
I'm sorry. It just...It seems silly. Like kissing a girl. <+++++> Clever observation. Go back to Wichita. Oh that's right, you can't.
Power yoga? <+++++> Picking out my wedding dress!
Go on... <+++++> Me and my little sister, went down to the water hole, last Saturday--
Hello. <+++++> Hello miss.
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to. <+++++> He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
It is nine p.m. Pleasant dreams. <+++++> Wait. No. You're kidding. Lights out? At nine? My day's just starting.
Great, isn't it? <+++++> It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV? <+++++> I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men. <+++++> That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
Is it Japanese? <+++++> Um... yeah. Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
I didn't say a word about "you know what". <+++++> What are you talking about?? ?
Who is it? <+++++> Annina Nosei.
Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us. <+++++> The families who control the casinos?
Because it's in English? <+++++> Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground.
But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home. <+++++> I want the rest of the pictures.
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe. <+++++> I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.
No. <+++++> Do you have something against traveling?
Why? <+++++> The TV didn't work.
You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died. <+++++> The night is young. Anyway, it was logical. You know, you're a great one for logic.
He trusts you to lock up? <+++++> Let's just say he knows who I am.
Well, no, I don't see any way. And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance. <+++++> No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way.
What? <+++++> Get everyone down in the basement.
Where's the towel? <+++++> On the chiffonier. Here.
I didn't get his name. A friend of your father? <+++++> He isn't any friend of Father.
You gonna tell me why? <+++++> No.
Can you watch the road? <+++++> See. Dry. It's in the delivery.
It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal. It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you. <+++++> Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President. <+++++> Well, you can't do that because he's dead.
Sally, for Christ's sake. <+++++> Anyone else?
We have a multiple homicide, Sir .. <+++++> 
You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's... <+++++> She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
Who knows? Right. <+++++> Looks pretty shallow.
There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again? <+++++> Jake.
Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women? <+++++> Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
Child pornography. <+++++> There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.
Listen, uh... Hank and I think it best if you stay on shore. <+++++> I beg your pardon?
Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco. <+++++> Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?
Why, what's wrong? <+++++> The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'? <+++++> And no lies!
Thirsty. <+++++> Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
Are you gonna steal my shoes now? <+++++> No, I tell fortunes by reading the crease, now shut up and go to sleep.
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks. <+++++> Want to know what I think happened?
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ... <+++++> Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.
And what? <+++++> Stop playing me Sloan.
Then I'll have to kill you. <+++++> Then kill me.
We have enough for a shuffleboard team. In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything. Hitler plays shuffleboard. <+++++> Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
Uh...Where...where do you want to go? <+++++> A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger, Fren-n-ch Fries. This is France, you gotta have French..... <+++++> Actually we're in Italy, Snickers, she said as if it made a difference.
Well, news of Buckley? <+++++> Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
Andy... we don't want the viewer to get out of their chair. They might change the channel. <+++++> But it's funny! It's a practical joke. They'll get frustrated!
Oh, yes, what? You'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...? <+++++> I can make you rich.
My husband didnÂt need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered... <+++++> To get me killed...?
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours. <+++++> If we've got any surprises for each other -- we shouldn't be in any condition to do anything about it. You play chess?
I'll call her up. <+++++> You call her up for yourself, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
Shit! <+++++> What? !
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning... <+++++> I mean the performance. Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around...
Feel? I dunno... Happy. <+++++> How will you fight Apollo Creed?
Huh? <+++++> They're movin'.
What's Ozzy trying to say there? <+++++> Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
Yes, you are. And you must wake. <+++++> I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
We ain't bad men no more, Bill. Hell, we're farmers. <+++++> Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
What are you doing with the gun? <+++++> What are doing with yours?.
NO WAY! <+++++> Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me.
Kids get scared. <+++++> What's to be scared about? It's just a little hiccup in the power.
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy. <+++++> My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome.
Great, okay. Ask him about his weapons. <+++++> That's smart. Let's talk about guns and violence.
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh-- <+++++> Certainly!
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated? <+++++> I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
Then stop treating me like a fucking prop. <+++++> I-I'm sorry. I got caught up in the action...!
Oh. Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street. <+++++> Thank you.
Stand up. <+++++> No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-
Hello, Mama  ... brought you something. <+++++> Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
I won't--I'll ask for one right now. Sally tells me she's in love with you. <+++++> She did?
Beautiful. What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy. He had all those files. <+++++> Who was paying you, Dave?
I'd like to, but... <+++++> Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast. What time will you...
Yes. <+++++> He's your client, huh?
Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you. <+++++> Then what the fuck did you do it for?
 <+++++> You almost convince me. I'm just drunk enough to tell you the truth.
Get the fuck away from my car. <+++++> I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
Do you think you can steer this thing? <+++++> Sure.
I killed him. <+++++> Why?
Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night. Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus! <+++++> Get him!
Storage, I think. <+++++> Not with those smokestacks it's not.
I said no touching. <+++++> Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut. <+++++> Not nice. Not kind.
I hate sports. <+++++> How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and -- <+++++> -- Well what am I supposed to call you?
Oh yeah? <+++++> You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
Will you do that? Then I want you to get out of the room. <+++++> Why?
Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests-- <+++++> Well, then--I--I don't feel I can stay, sir.
On the other side were wild rose bushes. The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down. <+++++> If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along. <+++++> Nothing ever really changes, does it, David?
Well, come on! <+++++> Easy! It's forty miles, sonny...Horses can do with some grain and a little rest.
Let's bring your bags inside. <+++++> Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else. <+++++> They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
He's not home. <+++++> Where can I find him?
Oklahoma, Thelma. We're crossing into New Mexico. <+++++> I always wanted to see New Mexico.
So what's up? <+++++> Stop freaking with her head man. Just stop playing with her mind, you know? She's a human being. She's a person.
Ambassador Han. <+++++> Yes.
So how are you really doing, Panes? <+++++> Why don't you go fuck yourself?
Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing? <+++++> Blondes.
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday. <+++++> Good for you baby.
So what do we do? <+++++> You go down there.
That's interesting. <+++++> It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus! <+++++> Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.
You, ah...  You present the appearance of a man with a problem. <+++++> Your perception is correct, Doctor...
Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--? ! <+++++> It's just that my movie is so-
Who put you up to this? <+++++> Huh? Oh, hi, Tracy
Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue... <+++++> No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
So you're still breast-feeding? <+++++> The doctor said it was okay. Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
Mmm. <+++++> You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
1840... 50... 60... 70... <+++++> Going over the wall. Coming to bearing 065. Everybody stay tight and in sight.
Wake up. <+++++> Is he dead?
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please. <+++++> Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
Okay. I understand. I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then. <+++++> Wendy,  let me explain something to you. Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you're breaking my concentration.
I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining. <+++++> Is there something bad here?
You have no time. What is your question? <+++++> I'm thinking!
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we? <+++++> Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money. <+++++> How much?
Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph. <+++++> 'Many years, uh...
And as treasurer, you could release those funds? <+++++> When so ordered.
Turn around. <+++++> We know these people...!
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something. <+++++> A parakeet?
Yeah. <+++++> I don't like the way I am sometimes. Can you help me?
Isn't it beautiful?! ! <+++++> It's grand!
I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to. <+++++> Nothin' personal, huh? The man that kills me, I want him to do it because he hates my guts.
The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history. <+++++> I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own.
This one's probably watching <u>you</u>, laughing at you. <+++++> Let me get a little action started here.
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard. <+++++> It's hit us all hard!
The shopkeeper on 13th street won't drop the lawsuit--He still claims one of the lasers we fired at the Jenkins gang burned down his store.. <+++++> I hate innocent bystanders. Whine, whine, whine. Will he settle?
Yeah. Page me. You know the number? <+++++> Yeah. I know the number.
Let me think about that. <+++++> Okay.
It's all arranged for tonight. Eddie Mack's gonna be there. And Offisa Korruptsky, too. <+++++> They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
Are you a gambling man? <+++++> When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
No! <+++++> Run!
Where'd you get this? <+++++> It was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine. You're saying it's not you?
Active. <+++++> Main bus...
I... submit to Our Lord. <+++++> But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away. <+++++> Now you and David...
Sir...? <+++++> And your jewelry too. I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away. <+++++> No, weÃ­re going to recover the disk, understand?! Now move!
Fine. I'll just wait here. <+++++> I'd appreciate that.
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do! ? <+++++> Read the inscription on the cover!
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you? <+++++> We don't look on it like that.
As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>? <+++++> I am impressed. We used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card.
I don't believe it ! <+++++> I got Games & Theory.
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do. <+++++> Do you blame yourself for helping me?
It must of been a convincing letter. <+++++> It was. I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.
No. It's just my job to find him. I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs. <+++++> How did it happen?
Don't forget your CDs. <+++++> Those aren't mine.
Fired? <+++++> Yeah. She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand.
Hold on there - I don't want this pomade, I want Dapper Dan. <+++++> I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
She's never coming out. <+++++> Hey.
Our Steven not only disguises himself. <+++++> Yes.
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked. <+++++> That's very lovely actually.
Right. Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it? <+++++> Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
Mr. Spock: have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program? <+++++> Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will...  Make a <u>guess</u>.
When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring. <+++++> Yes! With a herring! With a herring! Cut down with a herring!
That's an affirmative. <+++++> Keep your eyes open.
You're right. <+++++> There you go. Love you.
Grand champion, is it? And what great cause leads you to me? <+++++> We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir. He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me? <+++++> Certainly.
Gee, we haven't had one of those in a long time, have we Gallagher? <+++++> Not since you broke into society.
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor. <+++++> You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
Take your time. <+++++> Thanks.
Roger that. Opening doors now. <+++++> Stairway, youÃ­re wrapped, go to transport.
You did kill those men. <+++++> Not all of them.
They're not open yet? <+++++> They don't get opened until eight.
Acetylene? Mig? Tig? <+++++> Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.
What's the matter hon? You were great. Terrific. A tiger. <+++++> Thanks.
Neither of us really belongs here. <+++++> Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow? <+++++> Nothing, I guess. Just an observation. She's really something special. You're a lucky fella.
A little. <+++++> Sorry.
Maybe. Maybe not. <+++++> I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself? <+++++> Well, sir, I putter.
That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will. <+++++> No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command.
Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more? <+++++> It's hard to imagine.
Do I have to? <+++++> You bet. I got a terrific hand.
Isn't this...? <+++++> Hm.
What do you like to eat here? <+++++> French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see-- <+++++> Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out. <+++++> Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves.
Spare me. <+++++> -- Christ, Viktor, look around. What do you think pays for all this? This is about investment and return.
Why are you so cold to her and Carlo? They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them. <+++++> I'm busy.
He doesn't need to know all my business. <+++++> He's gonna find out.
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings? <+++++> No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
No, it doesn't... just kiss me. <+++++> It does matter. We're in love.
We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started. <+++++> Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee --
She made me promise not to. <+++++> Who? Who made you promise? It's alright Agnes. It's alright. Let's go to your room.
Answer the question, Patrick <+++++> Nothing! There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile? <+++++> Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat.
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to. Lately I'm not so sure. <+++++> Why not?
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.? <+++++> What run him off? Tell me that!
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really. <+++++> No.
What is it - What's wrong? <+++++> Whoa!
How much time do they get to spend with their dad? <+++++> What is it with this? They wouldn't spend less time with Peter if they lived here! He has no time!
No... I can't! <+++++> Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea. <+++++> Your idea? Well, that fits. I mean, the two of you, that fits together. I should have seen that long ago.
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything? <+++++> They thought it was a publicity stunt.
Not likely, convict. <+++++> You gonna let me keep any of it?
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago? <+++++> Ten years ago? Let's see... ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
And where am I gonna be? <+++++> In the parking lot, with her.
Hello, Dorothy. <+++++> Hello, Nick! And a party - celebrating father's third murder -
What? <+++++> "Of the Rich and Famous". Of which we are neither. Are you out of your mind? We can't afford this.
In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father. <+++++> Jesus!
Did Dickie's Dad go? <+++++> He's having an early night.
That's Franny. She likes firemen. <+++++> Tim, fill out the alarm card. Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
Hell of a show. Hell of a job, Stan. <+++++> ...one more day.
Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off? <+++++> Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
That lab was consumed by fire last week. how did you manage to escape? <+++++> I have here a proposal showing how Wayne Enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment.
How old was she when this happened? <+++++> Fourteen. We seal juvenile records until they're deceased. That's why you didn't find it in your computer.
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties. <+++++> Here. Now leave me alone.
Yeah-- <+++++> Faith. Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
No. <+++++> He is, Mr. Torrance.
No. Yes. I mean, depends on -- <+++++> The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them. Because you went soft on another women --

Fascinating. Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it? <+++++> Most of the time I slap it.
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner? <+++++> Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
You're not a pain in the ass.... <+++++> Will you let me finish. I've been working on this all day.

Oh. Congratulations. <+++++> The marriage already ended.
And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia. <+++++> Oh.
Ready for what, baby? <+++++> Whatever.
Wanna drink. <+++++> Please.
I could run off them whores. <+++++> Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.

Hello again. <+++++> Could I speak to you in private?
You heard me. Count it out. <+++++> He can't prove anything, John. He can't turn us in.
I'd forgotten. <+++++> Well I hadn't. I was worried about inherited craziness when they married. I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'
Hey Walter-- <+++++> Mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain.
Your mother's pastor. <+++++> What happened to my Dad? ?
Not when I'm with you, Ted. <+++++> I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
When one sees you they all see you. <+++++> An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.

That's correct, sir. <+++++> Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.

That's pretty bad. <+++++> Thank you, Dulcea. For everything.

To win this war I need an army. <+++++> Oh, indeed? You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes! They beg you to consider the future.
You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me. <+++++> Is that a fact?
You're still a writer. <+++++> I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
I can't ... <+++++> Thou must.

We have a treaty with Austria. <+++++> Not one I should like to rely on.
Miss -- <+++++> You find a girl?
What is this? 'Twenty Questions'? <+++++> Just curious. There's a lot of talk goes around.

Why do you think he did it? <+++++> It got to be too much for him.
I'm scared... <+++++> DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!

Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal? ! <+++++> Mark...
It's a trick! After him. They're in the south stairwell! <+++++> Get more men up there!

You are a gentleman. <+++++> And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
Honest, Toby. I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox. <+++++> Stay out of this, Jenny. We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...

Then who wrote the report? <+++++> It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?

Hi! <+++++> Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ? <+++++> Uh, no.

Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit! <+++++> Now see here young man.

But you said grey, sir. <+++++> Not tweed -- it's a smoother material, with a larger collar and belted.

And like a fool I believe it. <+++++> Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks. <+++++> Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.

Thank you, Bobby. A big score? <+++++> Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.

Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff. <+++++> Ain't nobody goin' to neither, long as Uncle Birdie's around.
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants? <+++++> Slim.
O'Grady. <+++++> Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...
What is your response? <+++++> Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry. It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.
Does she know about us? <+++++> Jesus, she's my best friend.
"Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy." <+++++> This guy was a bad monkey. He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight. <+++++> Take plenty of cigars.
White man just using you to keep the Black man down. <+++++> This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.

Give your father the benefit of the doubt. Talk to him. Let him see who you are. <+++++> Isn't there an easier way?
Oh huzzah, the master's home. <+++++> Do you have it? !
For what cause? <+++++> I don't need a cause, just a lawyer.

Now I have a little plan to keep this from happening. --Do you think you can play along? <+++++> Yes, sir.
What story did you give to Davis? <+++++> We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down.

I think that you might go and have a look yourself. <+++++> Yes, maybe that is better.
Luke. Where you goin? <+++++> On my own.
That's what she is! <+++++> I know that. But --
But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time. <+++++> Do we even get our same bunks back?
I just got out here! <+++++> It's lunchtime, and I wanna have a talk with you, Nathan Lee. Come on, children...
How is the garden doing? <+++++> I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'. <+++++> I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal. <+++++> Maybe he doesn't care about that.
We're losing the war, aren't we. <+++++> It kind of looks that way.
What's goin' down, son? <+++++> Nothin'  I'll be okay, pop.

Yeah...You've fallen for her. <+++++> I told you, I have a feeling...
I said yes, I see. <+++++> Oh no, I don't think --
It looks like scurvy. <+++++> Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables.
Stop it! <+++++> I was just getting to the interesting part!
Don't let anyone know what's happening. This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore. <+++++> All right.
You happy, baby? <+++++> Yeah. I am.
You mean he doesn't like bad guys. <+++++> 'That right?
Oh, for Christ's sake. <+++++> You are.

He's cute...And he's got a crush on you... But... <+++++> I miss Ray...I tried to call him.
No. I was in the shower. <+++++> So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant. <+++++> He wants to improve himself... and you will be able to play on it ... Teach him to look after it.
She goes to Parson's, right? <+++++> I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door. <+++++> You're afraid of him.
So where is it then? <+++++> Somebody took it from him. That's what this whole thing's about.
She's the captain, we should listen to -- <+++++> Listen to her? <u>Her</u>? When she was willing to sacrifice us all?
How's it going? <+++++> Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for? <+++++> We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble.
They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over. <+++++> Who can we trust?
It's over. It's over. <+++++> Nancy...
I'm still okay. <+++++> Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return. All parts intact.
Do you think Darryl's having an affair? <+++++> I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
It's been delightful meeting you both. <+++++> And you will come to hear us tonight?
No. I'm just a little tired. <+++++> Then why don't you go to sleep?
Fuck this shit! <+++++> You guys trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head.
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober. <+++++> I don't think I will, Rick.
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer. <+++++> Great stars have great pride.
What if they call him? <+++++> They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it... <+++++> They what? What? No. No. Why?
Sorry. <+++++> We'll be there in ten minutes.
Thanks, it's starting to kick in. I feel almost human. <+++++> Yeah, me too.
I'm positive. <+++++> Well, I'm a little confused here.
It's my name, Dil -- <+++++> What happened to Jimmy?
You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet. <+++++> Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me.
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge. <+++++> WHAT!
Oh that's okay, I hardly even-- <+++++> Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you. You will receive no bill.
There's some kind of animal loose in the museum. Pendergast's alone. He needs help. I want volunteers to go with me. <+++++> I'm in.
Okay, but come here first. <+++++> Huh.
Once again we find ourselves in agreement. What kind of work do you do, Big Dan? <+++++> Sales, Mr. McGill, sales! And what do I sell? The Truth! Ever' blessed word of it, from Genesee on down to Revelations!
 <+++++> Yeah, I heard that. Now tell me what you really do.
You're not far from Cypher. <+++++> Cypher, I thought --
That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before? <+++++> Yeah, twice.
You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie? <+++++> Hello?
Okay. Now, the last time you saw your son was when? <+++++> Oh, about ten days ago.
You work there, Miss Abbott. <+++++> I'm not Miss Abbott.
All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power! <+++++> You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
Like it was yesterday. <+++++> A couple days later they decided to use the Ladder, on one test battalion. Yours.
You're not going to drive. <+++++> Give me the keys!
He warned about the future of Tibet. <+++++> Tell me.
There's an item you picked up that's marked. Will you read it? <+++++> Dristan nasal spray.
Not until I get that Beta Cam back! We're both in a world of shit here! ! <+++++> I can't.
I was holding for someone. That wasn't even mine. <+++++> The game was to make me smaller than he was. No matter what.
What's takin' so long over there? <+++++> This peter's a motherfucker.
Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me? <+++++> You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.
How <u>you</u> doing? <+++++> Great. Network news, Washington... I love it. What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
How do I know you don't want to blow up a factory? <+++++> What for... why?
No. <+++++> Oh.
I'm the Princess, aren't I? <+++++> Of course --
Where is he? <+++++> Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
...I'm going to need your help... <+++++> You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand? Huh...?
Yes, quite, but you should know that... <+++++> That will be all, Major. I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
Oh my God. <+++++> Well, it's finally happened.
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us. <+++++> I haven't got it.
Don't fuck with me. <+++++> It's not your fault.
How much you got to see the show? <+++++> You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free.
No. <+++++> Following the game at all?
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them. <+++++> What...? <u>Oh</u>.
I know, but... <+++++> You gotta do it.
To feel it growing inside you. All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards. <+++++> Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a gender-related issue. She's still tense.
-- how did you get here? <+++++> -- took a bus.
What do you mean? <+++++> Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
 <+++++> Talk about sad.
It worked. <+++++> I made it work.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they? <+++++> They're stragglin'.
You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going? <+++++> Yeah. I know where you're going.
You're like New York. You're an island. <+++++> 
I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore! <+++++> Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
What would you call them then? <+++++> I don't know... 'Episodes.'
A fair number, Ma. <+++++> Say your prayers?
That's a long fall. <+++++> So how are you, Morty?
I'm a welder. <+++++> Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
I feel giddy. <+++++> But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before.
You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you? <+++++> I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.
What do you mean? <+++++> I mean it's fucking empty.
That's enough, Edie. <+++++> I don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it.
What? I... I wasn't saying... <+++++> Please, there's no... Oh.
Um, okay... roll camera <+++++> Rolling.
Where do you live? <+++++> With Mama and Shirley and Stringbean.
We should have jumped his ass. <+++++> Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
You become a whole other person when you're out here, Stan. And I don't like it. <+++++> This is a man's game. Requiring a man's cunning and intelligence...
Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please. <+++++> A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so. Monsieur?
I'm going. <+++++> What about tennis? Riding? fixing up old cars? Bartending?
You didn't kill anybody. Stop. <+++++> I wish there was some way I could... just... pay the fine and go home.
Um-huh. <+++++> First of all, I have been feeling much better lately.
Oh, great, you found them. Where were they? <+++++> Here! In the car!
Floating to Catalina. <+++++> What?
Oh boy! <+++++> Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
Well why are they tearing the building down? <+++++> Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
No. Don't tell me that. <+++++> I'm sorry.
We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight. Is this true? <+++++> Absolutely correct.
So? <+++++> And anyway, he's seen our faces.
Easy tiger. <+++++> Alright. Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
I don't see anything. <+++++> Are you absolutely certain?
Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money. <+++++> What d'you know about women, Pop?
Sorry. But after our days... So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here? <+++++> I'll try to keep the door open. If you wash out, I make it so that --
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me. <+++++> What have you done, Junebug? Did you hit someone with the Previa?
How did they get in here? <+++++> Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me! <+++++> What a man!
Where are they going? <+++++> They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
No. <+++++> That means it's good.
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you. <+++++> Where are you going?
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work? <+++++> I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
I call myself Phoebe. <+++++> Why not? Tell me, Phoebe, do you want some day to have an award like that of your own?
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold? <+++++> Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
I don't have any money, Solomon. If you fire me -- <+++++> -- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give.
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off? <+++++> Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
How was it? <+++++> Better than I remembered.
You disgust me... even if what you say is true. <+++++> Then you won't forgive me?
Just like that? <+++++> Like turning off a light.
That's him! He did it! <+++++> Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but...
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to. <+++++> Yeah.
Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that. <+++++> I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there.
Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg. <+++++> I no understand you. Maybe crazy.
It's been a year since she died. <+++++> Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
You're fast. <+++++> That is our job.
Donkey raping shit eater. <+++++> Doky maping she deeder!! !
What Friday? <+++++> What day is this? In jail you lose track. This week. Friday.
Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money? <+++++> I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
Yeah? <+++++> I want you to come.
One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight? <+++++> Yes, dammit, and...
No, I'm sorry, I don't. <+++++> I was in here yesterday.
Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff. <+++++> You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
You -- I don't know. <+++++> ) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich? <+++++> Are you asking me to marry you?
 <+++++> I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy...
I wish to be your wife. <+++++> Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
I've done nothing wrong. I'm the victim here. <+++++> But not the only victim, right?
What is that? <+++++> That is my telescope.
I'm glad you've come home, Conner. <+++++> Me too.
Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go? <+++++> I go on rounds.
Call me during the week if you get the chance. <+++++> I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises. Well, thanks again for dinner.
If they're sick, great. But let's make sure. Come on, Nick. <+++++> Okay. We'll see what's up. But if things are cool, I don't want to hear anything more about this.
No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list. <+++++> Better person than I.
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken. <+++++> That don't seem fair.
Hrnrnrn? <+++++> That was quite a day yesterday.
Greased Lightning! Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined! <+++++> I thought you weren't talking to me.
The banks are out of luck, eh? <+++++> Oh, I don't know. They'll clear all right.
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone? <+++++> Yes--uh--
What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility. <+++++> I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
It's utterly beautiful. I wish I could be creative. <+++++> You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
What do you think? <+++++> What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know.... <+++++> What have you done, Cut your hand?
Cattle ranch! <+++++> I'm not kidding. You can get one if you have the credit. Look just like real cows, too.
You are ready, then? <+++++> Whether I am or not, you've been more than fair.
How's that? <+++++> Oh, I could die...
Are you sure we should be driving like this? In broad daylight and everything? <+++++> No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
 <+++++> <U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
I don't know. <+++++> Was he depressed?
How bad is it? <+++++> Nothing for you to worry about, darling
I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home? <+++++> Sure.
I want to know about Exley. <+++++> He's the opposite of you. He's more like me. Cold, calculating.
You're still here. <+++++> I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book. <+++++> Do you know what you were kidnapped by?
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda. <+++++> The commander is not here.
How do you know? <+++++> Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
Baby, there are beautiful babies here. <+++++> Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift.
Don't go in, Ryan. <+++++> What?
Did I miss anything? ! <+++++> Just in time.
Don't leave me... <+++++> I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
No. That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit. <+++++> Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey. <+++++> No. I baked them for you.
Mind if I turn out the light? <+++++> No...
 <+++++> I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you. <+++++> Absolutely.
I have to talk to you. <+++++> I'll be back later...
We've already met. <+++++> And this is...  ...Clark. My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now. You mustn't scream. So tense, so tense. <+++++> You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
Not coming? What happened? <+++++> He says he's got to stay in Chicago. He says I should visit him sometimes.
Away. From you. <+++++> But why?
I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave. <+++++> Aw, too bad.
Hello? <+++++> Hi. It's Frank.
Mrs. Lutz. She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world. <+++++> Has he gotten through to any?
Aren't they gauche...? Those steel things are so - common. <+++++> Nothing worse than a common tool.
No. <+++++> I think I got one today.
Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude? <+++++> Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.
That's the second round I've lost tonight. That fellow hurt me. <+++++> So have I.
Jesse, help! <+++++> I'm Jesse now, Lisa.
Can you take that damn thing off the table. <+++++> You mean my championship trophy? My bad.
Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left. <+++++> It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom... <+++++> Now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!
Is he all right? <+++++> Far as I know.
And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that. <+++++> Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket! <+++++> Where'd it come from before that?
Uh-huh. <+++++> Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great.
Where was this? <+++++> Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!
All right, I'm leaving. I'm sorry ma'am. <+++++> Don't run away from this, Dude! Goddamnit, this affects all of us!
Dan. And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne. You've been practicing. <+++++> Two hours a day, six days a week.
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer. <+++++> I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
And that makes you look like a squid? <+++++> I'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
Was I? <+++++> Yes.
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing. <+++++> Oh. Well I am.
I know. I'm great at what I do, Dad. I mean, I'm really great. <+++++> Let me tell you something, son. You would have been great at anything.
Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful. <+++++> You lie! You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
You're Kuato, right? <+++++> Wrong. Kuato's a mutant. So don't get upset when you see him.
No, Wes. <+++++> Jessica was never any good for Paul. You will be, you are.
Just gimme the damn remote! <+++++> I'm sorry. I can't do that.
Nor Quincy, I guess. <+++++> Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other. <+++++> All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
Yes. <+++++> Location green. One hour. IÃ­ll be there myself.
I'm turning off the alarm. I'm turning off everything. <+++++> Ah! The lady is armed.
I thought I was helping you. <+++++> It would help me if I could kiss you.
Why do you say that? <+++++> How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab. <+++++> Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
One last time. It's important ... <+++++> You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie! What could be more important than that?
It wasn't my fault. <+++++> If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
I don't get it. <+++++> Lemme clarify for you.
That's right... <+++++> And have you heard anything from our dear friend, Sally? What with all the rumors getting back to England. I thought she might inquire after us.
You know how to waltz? ? <+++++> I was going to fake it.
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano. <+++++> That's not a piano.....I have a piano at home.....where'd you get it?
You're late, Cartman! <+++++> I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself. <+++++> Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
Think about that reward, Johns. <+++++> I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors. <+++++> I'll take care of it, sir.
Why not? <+++++> I've stopped menstruating
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ... <+++++> Screw congressional oversight.
Put me down for ten, you louse. <+++++> I'll call the whole pot.
This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug. <+++++> Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself.
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you <+++++> What do you mean 'stole'? I didn't steal anything from you.
In hiding. He sent Liddy to talk to me. <+++++> And?
Of course. <+++++> I can't believe I'm doing this.
How many, would you say? <+++++> Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.
What thing? <+++++> Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
What do I do? <+++++> Follow her.
It's working! <+++++> Easy ... Easy ... I'm going to throw in my trap now.
Back it down, Johnny! <+++++> I can go hotter!
And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them. <+++++> Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows.
Congratulations. Who's the lucky girl? <+++++> I am.
Don't get carried away. <+++++> I find myself in dire need of some cash.
I don't know. <+++++> If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I --
They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down. <+++++> I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
I just don't see him in the big picture. <+++++> I've known him since Cub Scouts.
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back? <+++++> Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
On radio waves? <+++++> And garbage doors.
Edvard! I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read. And she no like. <+++++> Really? Was the third act too intense?
Why do you love me? <+++++> Why do you love me?
It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off. <+++++> Sure -- take him to the vet.
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period. I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me. <+++++> And you turned him down? ?
His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down. <+++++> Can we get him to the hospital?
I don't know. He mentioned a city. <+++++> What is it?
It's us - our love. He can't find a crack in it. He can't find a way in. <+++++> Maybe he's just - waiting...
Then, perchance you'll me. <+++++> If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
Thank you. <+++++> I'll have the fire built up.
We got to stop them right here. <+++++> And get ourselves another touchdown to win. I wish to hell we knew what they were plotting.
You want... <+++++> I don't know --
Yes. On my torso. <+++++> 
No? <+++++> 
It has brought him as much trouble as glory. Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew. <+++++> All right. I'll act as the sword's custodian.
It isn't safe for you to remain in this area. <+++++> He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
Cut him loose of the line up by his shack. <+++++> Cut him loose?
Oh, I have to hear this. <+++++> In my heart, Heather's still alive.
Can't beat it with a hammer. Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot. <+++++> That's wonderful. Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your own?
Where's Irth? <+++++> Sandy, scan the whole sky.
I've always thought that myself. <+++++> Oh, yes.
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back. <+++++> She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
I can't marry you! I can't ever marry you! <+++++> Dorothy!
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine. <+++++> Nathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon.
Go to the liquor store -  Where is there a liquor store around here? <+++++> Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play... <+++++> I'm telling you it's not that.
She's not the world's greatest flyer, let me tell you. When she was eight years old, she... <+++++> Dad.
They are beautiful. <+++++> Yes, they are.
He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away! Koontz, please! <+++++> I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.
A woman? <+++++> Hey drop it, okay?
Undisclosed conflict of interest -- <+++++> An offense --
Where do I sign? <+++++> The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
Aids, the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs. <+++++> What do you mean, walked?
Why? <+++++> Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
Where are you off to? <+++++> I'm going parading before it's too late!
Where are you? <+++++> Jean-I'm not-
Do you like music? <+++++> Yes, I do -- very much.
So? <+++++> So I don't know about horror.
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine. <+++++> Mama, what's...
You never fall short for the work people. I guess maybe you just love them more. <+++++> Oh, God, sweetheart, no. There's nothing on Earth I love more than you. Nothing. I promise.
She looks tired. <+++++> She's stunted, that's one thing.
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality. <+++++> What do you mean -- sex equality?
You must think I'm quite the madman. <+++++> The thought had crossed my mind.
So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor? <+++++> It is a favor, isn't it?
Three bullets! Any good? <+++++> Beats king up.
Like Job? <+++++> Ah, but, we're asking about you.
Can't this thing go any faster? <+++++> Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
Why? <+++++> Because you are dangerous.
So you gonna try and make up with Sid? <+++++> Duh... that's quick.
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you? <+++++> Two thousand...
Ally. That was my nickname. <+++++> Ally. That's right.
How did it happen? <+++++> 
I might wake up. <+++++> <i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it.
"What do we tell him about the guns and money?" <+++++> "We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
Joe! <+++++> Come over here where I can see you.
If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth. <+++++> I guess.
No! <+++++> Captain!
I don't know anything! <+++++> Good. Then call him back. And call me back. Don't worry.
Marty... <+++++> I just wanna kiss, that's all.
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera. I didn't know what to say. <+++++> You're joking.
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children. <+++++> Well, she loves children, all right. She loves everybody.
That's not correct. <+++++> What's wrong with it?
Oh! I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein. <+++++> No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you. <+++++> Me -- a son.
Too young? <+++++> Much too young.
As the wife of one of our party. <+++++> So why follow me? Escort me, by all means. Following me is predatory, isn't it?
If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off. <+++++> Are you quite sure?
Had a package to deliver. <+++++> You? Personally?
I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental. <+++++> I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive.
I just wanted to relieve your mind. Your father's alive and all right. <+++++> Oh, thank heaven.
Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas... <+++++> If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.
To his own daughter? <+++++> To anybody.
But I don't gamble, Hilda! <+++++> I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's. <+++++> What's her story?
Yeah. Well. They're a talkative buncha commentators. <+++++> You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
Oh, my God! <+++++> Climb, Gabe, climb!
And after she was thrown out, she needed a job. <+++++> You don't believe in the paranormal.
What are you doing up? <+++++> I was thirsty.
Louis <+++++> Randolph!
And now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages? <+++++> In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers. <+++++> I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill. <+++++> Blacks welcome there?
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information -- <+++++> They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
Spare us. <+++++> 
It's the only name I've got. How about you? <+++++> No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
-- It's hard to believe this schmuck Kyle would go to such lengths for Coors beer. <+++++> It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you -- <+++++> Well, I wouldn't say --
I'm kinda feeling nuts myself! <+++++> I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
I know who you are, Inspector Lee. <+++++> Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour... <+++++> You want to keep him happy.
You should go on a trip. <+++++> No thanks.
A plague? <+++++> The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war.
Well, get a message through to him too. <+++++> Brilliant. Word perfect I'd say.
I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back. <+++++> You did. You're right.
What? ! <+++++> Yes. And "do not try to understand them. That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense..."
She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points. <+++++> Think she means for us to follow?
No, thanks... <+++++> Go on, whatcha gotta lose, yo' here now...
This rig? Phht. No problem. <+++++> So I'll see you this weekend.
Peace of mind. <+++++> That's it?
It isn't that -- you said, "have to go." What could compel you -- <+++++> Don't make me tell you, Jason.
Why do I have to stay down here? <+++++> Jesus, Jaeger.
Please. Something is going to happen... <+++++> What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender.
You're the advisor. You should stop her. She's not qualified. She's just a sophomore. <+++++> Calm down, Tracy. Just calm down.
I'm surprised you aren't blind by now. <+++++> I'm sorry. Who are you?
...give me protection? <+++++> Yeah! He'd kill for you Dave. He likes you. Your mind.
Let me talk to him. <+++++> No.
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy. <+++++> But it's what he said, just before they killed him:  "I regret that I have but one life to give to my country."
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it? <+++++> I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.
But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me? <+++++> I guess you'll find out.
"ÂHave not saints lips, and holy palmers too?" <+++++> "Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
I would. <+++++> Thomas?
Excuse me, Sergeant. <+++++> Yes, Reverend?
I love you, Carmen. <+++++> Shhh...
A parrot bit me. <+++++> Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
Um, Clear? I'm sorry...about before. I... <+++++> Your entire world view just went out the window. I couldn't expect a religious conversation overnight. We'll get through this. I promise.
Captain -- I might have a way to find them. <+++++> Counselor?
What? <+++++> Gabriel and his guys. What's the last place they robbed?
Does Clifford even know? You didn't tell him, did you? I'm gonna tell him. Where is he? <+++++> He knows, Frances.
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days. <+++++> Was that difficult to get?
I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor. Because I don't want you to examine me. <+++++> Why?
We don't need a warrant if it's a riot. <+++++> 
And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that? <+++++> I could shore use some. Thank ye.
I bet. <+++++> Various enterprises, style of thing.
Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants? <+++++> Sixty days. Here. Don't mention it.
Exactly as the simulations predicted... <+++++> Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels...
Men sill give women flowers, don't they? I mean, as a sign of appreciation? I'm not that out of date, am I? <+++++> No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
You don't understand this guy. <+++++> Let him come to the wedding. You're not running, right? Say it. "I'm not..."
What's the matter? <+++++> Nothing... Let's get crazy!
-- Tonight he forgot. <+++++> Yes, I come, I will do it.
I just can't believe it. <+++++> This is your moment, don't you see? The instant when you know that your life is never going to be the same again.
You're apologizing for me? Quite the gentleman.. <+++++> Not really. I triggered the alarm..
You should sit down, darling. She's quite all right. Are you pregnant? <+++++> I don't think so.
Come on, old... <+++++> ...Pete! Come on! There it...
You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore-- <+++++> Cliff--
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al. <+++++> It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job.
What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy? <+++++> It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave? <+++++> I own the place.
Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night. <+++++> He was lucky... Sit there.
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister. <+++++> I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid! God, I can't find them. I can't find them anywhere. <+++++> I'm sure they're around.
So? <+++++> Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose. <+++++> Why can't we?
The legs must be goin'. <+++++> Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece. <+++++> That's good money.
You've no right to assault me in this fashion; I'll call for my footman. I'll have you removed -- <+++++> Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet --
Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun... <+++++> Does it, really? How come you never took some sell-out establishment job? You had plenty of chances!
I think you need to entertain more. Seriously! Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt. <+++++> As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move. Perhaps Martha will join me this winter.
You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate. <+++++> It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
Well, Holmes, what do you think? <+++++> It's an interesting one, Pete. If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.
And you, you-you're going? <+++++> Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he - <+++++> I have his journal.
Calm down. Why would they keep playing after you paid? <+++++> You think I know? I paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.
The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me. Why the mirrors? <+++++> The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them. I don't have an answer for you.
Sir--- <+++++> Shut up! Drop it.
Bob, rip up some bandages. <+++++> Pass me some whisky.
I wouldn't be caught dead. No, it's probably how I would be caught. The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait -- <+++++> -- and it's gonna be a hot time in the cold town tonight.
Daddy, why can't I...? <+++++> Did you hear what I said? Come inside....
I'll be down in a minute <+++++> O.K.
Will you? You underestimate The Emperor. It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer. <+++++> And that is why I must go.
Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current. <+++++> Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
Bits of blood and wood. What else would there be? <+++++> No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
Because... I'm Tyler Durden. <+++++> Then, I'll have the clam chowder... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie.
How long have you been freelance? <+++++> Two years. Two long fucking years.
The way we figure it, Barbara flies to Boston twice a week. Two bags per flight. Twenty-five pounds in each bag. <+++++> You're kidding, right? That's a hundred pounds a week.
Mr. Gittes! You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down. <+++++> What for?
Ain't no place safe. <+++++> Look...I know you have no reason to trust me. I've got friends in the Cave.
This time I really don't see anyone man. <+++++> Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.
On my life, I promise you I will. <+++++> If you're lying, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
There are fucking coyotes out there. <+++++> Sally, calm down. We're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical.
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him. <+++++> -- I'm going to try, Mr. Webster.
Yeah. <+++++> You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
You do it... you first! <+++++> One thousand feet. Pull the goddamn cord!
You bet your ass. It keeps him going. Maybe it keeps all of us going. <+++++> How many were there?
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol. <+++++> Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
Good morning... <+++++> That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!"
Alright. Thank you. <+++++> Yep.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here. <+++++> So, whatÂs your point?
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke. <+++++> Well, stop listening to him.
Shut up and drive! <+++++> Whatcha doin' to me, man?! I got six kids to feed!
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time... <+++++> I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --
No! Oh no! Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more. <+++++> I wish Paul luck.
What did you find? <+++++> Jennifer Desiderio, for one. She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
Yeah. You look... great. I mean it.. <+++++> Really? Lieutenant?
And now? <+++++> Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
Like what? <+++++> Like sticking his nose into other people's business.
Chelsea 2-5598. <+++++> Two minutes.
Yeah. <+++++> You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
Why? <+++++> So I can go over there and pick up your things.
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great. <+++++> I just love her. How're you doing?
Now what? <+++++> We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report.
Jenny's basketball game went into overtime. If anybody ever told me I'd have a daughter who'd get a triple double, I'd... <+++++> Did they win?
Have the servants made you comfortable? <+++++> Yes, thank you.
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight. <+++++> The other girl is the star?
It doesn't protect your head, though. <+++++> That's why I wear a target on my chest.
Ohh! <+++++> And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
His technician okay? In addition to the Looks Department? <+++++> No question of her loyalty.
And I know the temper of our men. Rather than spend the war in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end. <+++++> You have heard your answer, Monsieur le Marquis.
Do you think Agnes is still attached to God? <+++++> Listen to her singing.
George, Kristina hates you. You fucked her over one too many times. And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego? <+++++> Yeah.
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment... <+++++> Attempted murder.
Yes. We're suing. <+++++> Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot. <+++++> Where?
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad? <+++++> A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
You can't find it in racing forms, Chick. <+++++> Fine thing Jim Taylor wished on me-- show him the monuments--I need this job like I need ten pounds.
Just great. <+++++> NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast. Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.
Athos, please...! <+++++> Get out of my way.
Bad boy.... <+++++> I didn't do it on purpose....
Nothing further, your Honor. <+++++> Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death? <+++++> I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.
You know what I mean, you don't even know him! <+++++> I feel like I do.
Then I get back to my office and <u>Aranson</u> is waiting for me and he knows <u>everything</u>. <+++++> Oh, honey.
How the heck? !... <+++++> What's going on? !
What's eatin' you, Jocko? <+++++> Nothin'. I just figure you were the right man for the job.
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have? <+++++> Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
We can't just sit here. We've got to start moving, so pick. <+++++> You sure you want me too?
Bedevere, my Liege. <+++++> Then I dub you ... Sir Bedevere ... Knight of the Round Table!
I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard. I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman. <+++++> Of course he is. I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...
Where'd you get this fag shit? <+++++> This is what the tough guys are wearin'. You know I only steal from the best. It's Bonwit Teller.
Well, she's my mother, not yours. <+++++> I won't be held responsible.
How long were you Mr Marsh's personal secretary? <+++++> Six years.
Were they pen pals? <+++++> No.
Really? <+++++> Yeah. Deep south. She laughs along with him, not sure why.
This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long! <+++++> Thirty feet?? ?
Believe what? <+++++> Her name. Bregitta. It's poetry.
Huh? <+++++> Take a hike. Am-scray.
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close. She'd tell me such a thing. <+++++> Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad.
No, this is <u>pleasure</u>... <+++++> And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious. <+++++> Do they have pressure?
I see. <+++++> Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
The password is: "One Hand Washes The Other." The minute you hear that, you say "I fear nothing." <+++++> I fear nothing.
If I thought I could get away with it - <+++++> Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed?
Thank you. <+++++> Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner.
Shi'ites, I think. <+++++> Is that good, or bad?
Yawn. That coulda come from anywhere. <+++++> What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us. <+++++> Only one way to find out.
I said no. Want me to pull rank ? <+++++> Well, excuse me, sir...
I would. <+++++> I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
Depends who it's from. <+++++> Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe. <+++++> Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married? <+++++> I don't wanna talk about it.
 <+++++> No, but I'm listening.
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about. <+++++> Thanks.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack? <+++++> I have no wife.
Wait for Kumar. <+++++> Come on, Kumar.
You got a good memory, Franky. <+++++> I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...
Yeah. Do I have a case? <+++++> Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms.
You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door! <+++++> You've already helped yourself once, Dennis; be smart again. If you save his life, it'll help when you get to court.
How bad was the unicorn's wound? <+++++> It happened so fast. He was hurt and ran away.
Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time... <+++++> We're not leaving you here, sir !
Not for me. <+++++> How about your wife and son? How do you think they'll take to it?
Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together. <+++++> Jim, you don't have to--
Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have? <+++++> Sorta brown, blonde, I guess. But dig this, sweetie.
We spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a Miss Louise Sawyer. Do you know her too? <+++++> Umm, yes. She was driving.
Which one of us is the informer? <+++++> You are trying to say that an American would inform on other Americans?
What? How long have you been standing there? <+++++> Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick... <+++++> I don't believe I'm hearing this. A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse. They were acting.
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight. <+++++> What happened?
I was about to throw in the towel. <+++++> I had a spot of bother at the door.
So, what do you see? <+++++> Surprise me.
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine? <+++++> She's a lesbian.
I guess. <+++++> Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station.
He's crazy. He can't help it. <+++++> Well, why don't they put him away? Prisons don't want him. I took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is again.
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy. <+++++> I'm so happy I could shit.
And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em... <+++++> That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade? <+++++> Razinin.
Nothing remotely like this. <+++++> I know what I'm asking. Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk. You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.

Hi, Penelope. <+++++> Shut up, you ninny! You were never to come here again-- for any reason whatsoever!

PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation. <+++++> Thanks. I'll keep it in mind.

Damn, you got a stalker. <+++++> That ain't the worst part. Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.
Do you think you have a good memory for faces? <+++++> Same as everyone else.
You can't go up there. <+++++> Why not?
Dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here. <+++++> No, I want to go in.
Yes. <+++++> Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.
If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training. <+++++> "Training?" Tyler...

But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren. I teach Library Science over at USC. <+++++> I didn't know how to stop you...!
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody? <+++++> Who are you?

Do you think he's here? <+++++> Here?
Uh huh. <+++++> When?
What if it hadn't been Wes? What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had... <+++++> You shouldn't think about things like that. It'll just make you crazy.
I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling... <+++++> Calm down Brent.
Did you just have a brain-fart? <+++++> Pardon?
Why? <+++++> Got to be somewhere.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why? <+++++> You ought to know why.
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date! <+++++> Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
"Need" is a good, solid word. <+++++> Nah, sounds too "needy."

I'm in psychology. Was. Still am really, just been a while. I treat aircrash survivors. <+++++> Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
It doesn't matter, anywhere but here. <+++++> You come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave...
He wants to see your map. <+++++> I'm almost done.
And a fine play. But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady. <+++++> What's your being married got to do with it?

Reckon what kind of a feelin'? <+++++> Like something different. I don't know. You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us. <+++++> The police are very busy.
You're kiddin'! Alright! I'll be there around two or three. <+++++> What kind of stuff do I bring?
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson. Work the clues. <+++++> What clues? I'm going to work Helen Hudson.

I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right? <+++++> What's furry, furry rabbit?

Are you sick? Are you drunk? Can you work? <+++++> Otis is dead.
Where were you? <+++++> I was in the city.

What does that mean? ! <+++++> It means you can do anything.
Oh, I'm sorry -- <+++++> No, it isn't your fault. The walls here are just so thin.
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else. <+++++> If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
I was wrong! ! <+++++> Is this your house?
Is it as good as I hope it is ? <+++++> Better, sir.
"And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY." <+++++> Definitely Whitney.

It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack. <+++++> Went --

Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent - <+++++> Hey! -
What other choices have we got? <+++++> I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.
I didn't tell you to do it! You can't just do unauthorized work. <+++++> Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you? I can't do unauthorized work.
Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders. He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing. <+++++> Him and me both. <u>Fucking Exley</u>.
On what. What makes you so certain. <+++++> I'll bloody well ask him.
What do you want? <+++++> The invasion plans.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground. Why are we even digging this thing? <+++++> Who cares, Z. All I know is, we gotta dig. We're not the ones in charge.
How did the car get back here? <+++++> WE got it back, that's all.
Can't be any worse than this. What do you think? <+++++> I think this river wants to take us home fast. I'm practically goin' in reverse.
Yeah, you met her? <+++++> His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
Hi. <+++++> What do you want, Stan?
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected. <+++++> I'm Chairman.
You are going to set the world on fire! You are going to...call me Uncle Billy? Please? <+++++> Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
For the last four years. <+++++> My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
Yes. <+++++> Everything's okay?
I wanted to give it to you first. <+++++> All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others.
So glad you could come. <+++++> What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
You see what you're doing, don't you? <+++++> What am I doing?
Then why are you listening to her - <+++++> Well, I have to go thank her for filling in and it's nice to know the tune she sang.
...eliminated one. SWAT's on the next two... <+++++> Trudy and I are goin' for Gina...
I came here before. <+++++> When was that?
How did you know about that? <+++++> Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy... <+++++> Why not?
But you said... <+++++> That's where I'm going. To see her.
Yes. I can't help the way I am. <+++++> Why'd you see him so regular?
Will, your not getting off that easy. <+++++> No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.
Go ahead. <+++++> TheyÃ­re dead.
Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time. <+++++> Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like.
I did not. <+++++> You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
Very well, m'sieu. <+++++> Otherwise I'll call the police
You mean like "time flies"? <+++++> Exactly. I would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things.
And? <+++++> They're offering...
How many men are working with you on this? <+++++> Less than you would guess. Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
So what? <+++++> Yes, so what. It's nothing serious, really. Just a small defect.
Look, Kathryn. They're jealous. <+++++> They're acting very strange suddenly.
This has nothing to do with any of that -- <+++++> Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
Switch to another station, huh? You're driving me crazy with that. <+++++> Segovia begged me for me secret but I said, "No, Andres, you'll have to try and make it without me."
Can you open the shuttlebay doors? <+++++> Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.
) What? <+++++> Sure it is. That's why you act so funny around each other.
Al. <+++++> Speak up. Come on.
...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing? <+++++> Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face. <+++++> Forget it. You're in no shape to climb alone.
I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother. <+++++> You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
They were vampires? <+++++> Same one.
No. <+++++> Was he drinking? Could you tell?
Want to look after you. <+++++> What does that mean?
Yeah. <+++++> You don't look half-bad.
Don't be defensive. I'm just surprised to see you. <+++++> Dad around?
The fucking point is-- <+++++> It's your roll.
-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing- <+++++> I assure you we came close many times-
I wish I knew. <+++++> Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
Where we going -- ? <+++++> We're going shopping -- !
I'd prefer you didn't. I'm very busy. <+++++> Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
You're a musician? <+++++> Yes, I thought my wife...
He's very caring, in his way. You haven't seen him at his best. <+++++> You could do better.
Yeah. <+++++> Well, let's go.
Me. <+++++> You?
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean? <+++++> Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
Fuck off, Barry. <+++++> I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
Awh, come off it, Pal. <+++++> No, I'm serious, really...
Do they let you -- <+++++> I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
What'd you say, hon...? <+++++> I said sometime it gets so...
Nice drawing. Did you do that? <+++++> My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
You. Mouth closed. <+++++> Okay.
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him. <+++++> Yeah.
Yes, heh-- <+++++> --and bowling. I'll tell you the truth, Brandt, I don't remember most of it.--Jeez! Fuck me!
What about the money? <+++++> I'll pay you back.
No we don't - <+++++> I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
What? Look, let me use the console for a few minutes. <+++++> You must be joking -  When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet.
I feel better. Do you? <+++++> Yeah, I do.
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink. <+++++> In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules.
I'm asking you a question -- <+++++> No, you're --
I did--and--and I got right up. <+++++> Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of?
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it! <+++++> Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today. C'mon with us.
Excuse me? <+++++> Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...What is it?
I'm impressed, Anderton. You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself. <+++++> Rufus. She's a precog.
And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do-- <+++++> Sooo...whattya think?
So what do you feel like doing tonight? <+++++> I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
Good. <+++++> But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
So dump on me. <+++++> This has nothing to do with you.
Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me. <+++++> I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
I mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away -- <+++++> -- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that --
It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable. <+++++> I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash. <+++++> I plan on liquidating almost evetything.
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country. <+++++> That's the spirit.
Everything's going to be beautiful. <+++++> You fake! You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon. You're not going to beat Harold.
Edith was just telling me about her job. <+++++> I'm a file clerk.
I thought there were too many forks on the table. <+++++> Well, one was for salad...
I feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' at my guts. <+++++> Aw, that's all right.
And? <+++++> He wasn't. One day I came home and found him taking a shower -- with another girl. And her sister.
Ya hit or sit, Martini? <+++++> Hit me.
No. <+++++> Joseph Harbin.
I donÂt think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey. WeÂll put Annie and Josh in private schools... <+++++> Annie goes to a great school.
Whoa. Deja Vu. <+++++> Sorry. Forgetful.
Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself. <+++++> Whatever you say, sir.
A player? <+++++> We have an M.O... Her system is protected by her 'pussy virus.'
I gotta be going. <+++++> Going to Turley, was it?
I need you so much! I love you! <+++++> Wake up, William. Wake up!
He hasn't. <+++++> Well, where is he then?
How much do you know about it? <+++++> Not a lot. I saw inside of the Science Center. What exactly happened?
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now. <+++++> Suit yourself, more for me. Scotty?
We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill. <+++++> We believe?
I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school-- <+++++> Yes--?
What guy? <+++++> Aw, he's some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out West. Gives my ranch the creeps and the willies, too.
Do your best, Tommy... <+++++> Oh god...
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie. <+++++> Certainly a new experience for me.
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right? <+++++> Thomas Mackelway.
All I told them was the truth. <+++++> They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
Very early. Dawn. <+++++> Of which morning?
Marvelous. <+++++> Lipstick?
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian. <+++++> Trychticholorate.
Hey--I want to ask you something. <+++++> Shoot, Jimbo.
So you lost a handbag, madame? <+++++> Yes.
Where's the light switch? <+++++> Where do you usually find a light switch?
No, they're not. I'd say your investment was paying dividends. <+++++> My what?
I'm sorry, your honor. <+++++> What?
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew? <+++++> I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
You mean my problem? <+++++> If by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes.
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times. <+++++> I don't know why I asked you to come.
Really? <+++++> Really, I haven't a bit of character. None at all.
Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title... <+++++> Freak luck is a strange thing.
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son. <+++++> Thank you.
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it. <+++++> I am in awe of it, Mother.
Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same. <+++++> Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good. <+++++> Uh-uh.
This is bullshit, man. <+++++> What the fuck do you...
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck. <+++++> No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
Hi. I hope I'm not disturbing... <+++++> She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait!
Not it...? <+++++> Nice, Jack. YouÂre sweeping me off my feet.
Mrs. Hinkle... do you drink? <+++++> No, I don't.
We're not getting whacked. <+++++> Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
Klingon blood. <+++++> They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
Tell me one? <+++++> She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
Oh, grow up. <+++++> Why should I?
All the more reason I should be here. <+++++> Please. It's for your own good.
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages. <+++++> That's great.
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore. <+++++> You'd deny a dying man his salvation?
You tell my old friend Mackie, I'll be seeing him. Soon. Real soon. <+++++> Wh-wh-whooo?
But -- <+++++> It was my master Keitel's idea.
No. I'd want to-- <+++++> Good.
Why should I loan you my car? <+++++> I want to rent a movie.
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to -- <+++++> Dickens! The whole world's about to blow up and you're reading Dickens? !
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns? <+++++> The poem?... The poem was great!
You sure this is a good idea? DOBISCH Can't think of a better one. <+++++> I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
Nothing, nothing. I just want to invite him to tea. <+++++> Tea?
Not entirely. <+++++> But that was part of it?
Nyah, you've done more than enough. Even the best of snake charmers get bit. <+++++> Ethan, tell me -
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open! We're fugitives now. Let's behave that way! <+++++> You're right.
You. <+++++> Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia? <+++++> Business.
You're crazy. I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money. <+++++> Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly.
'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12. <+++++> Gary?
I'll get there as soon as I can. <+++++> If we're moving the press conference, we need to do it now. Are you all right?
Ann ... Ann! <+++++> It' s alright Jack ... it' s alright.
Oh, still sore about this. <+++++> Something your father would've come up with.
Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself! <+++++> Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen...
Oh no -- oh no! ! <+++++> You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
The creator of what? <+++++> A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid. We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda! <+++++> Great! The marshmallows are about to get their revenge.
What do you know about the ear?. anything? <+++++> Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?
It was you. <+++++> Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
Thanks, Dad. I'll call you. <+++++> You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
Please. <+++++> Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit?
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble. <+++++> Forget that. Come on. Got a little surprise...
This is Nainsukh -- from the village. They bring him here to dig in the mines. <+++++> Why?
Very good... <+++++> 
The Mets. John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree. <+++++> Why are you protecting him? You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
Well? <+++++> Uh, what?
You would, huh? <+++++> Sure.
Jeffrey? <+++++> Yes?
Yeah, Colleen mentioned it. What do they make? <+++++> C.D.s. The music kind. From the Grendel label.
Carlson! <+++++> Yes, sir?
Where? <+++++> I told you, they hired me over the phone. I never met anyone.
What will you do after the war? <+++++> I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy! <+++++> No, no. It's okay.
No other possibilities? <+++++> You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?' That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.
I--I--gee whiz--I didn't thank you! <+++++> Don't mention it--
Don't lie to me. <+++++> All right, so I made another deal.
Good work, Number 1. You'll do. <+++++> Thank you, ma'am.
It has all about how he tried to kill her. <+++++> He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?
Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong. And these guys -- Donna and Peter -- <+++++> Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
It looks like a giant Jello mold. <+++++> I hate Jello.
Who? <+++++> Tom... He was there last night when Bobby told me what he saw.
I don't see what else you can do, Charles. If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has - <+++++> Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -
What's with the wigs? <+++++> I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life -- <+++++> Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night.
Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q. Citizen. So they close the book on J.F.K. It makes sense to me. <+++++> I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.
What the hell is the President trying to do? Steal DeHaven's thunder? <+++++> I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
Happy fuckin' Halloween. <+++++> Someone's trying to scare us out of having this fair ... and it's not gonna work.
Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way. <+++++> What about Cortina?
Benjamin? <+++++> Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
All right... where did you see her? <+++++> She's in my biology class.
George... <+++++> What did you say?
You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day. <+++++> Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
I lied. <+++++> I know.
Everybody knows Freddie Miles. <+++++> Is Freddie in Rome?
They'll be wanting it back. <+++++> Not after I'm done with it. Actually, I've been here. In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
You have an unusual hand. <+++++> I could have told you that.
 <+++++> Yeah.
... Can I help you? Are you looking for something? <+++++> No. I like this attic very much.
Mr. President, this is St... <+++++> Hi, How are ya? <u>Listen</u> to this, willya...
Let's go. <+++++> Move out.
Did they follow you? <+++++> I wasn't looking.
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric. <+++++> Can't help myself. Corbett's type always pisses me off. Oh, I found this at the post office. Had your name on it.
Hello? <+++++> Hello.
He's at work while I'm here. <+++++> I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
But you told us to starve. <+++++> Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door...  Ben! Knock it off!
So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor? <+++++> Right.
My seven body orifices??? ? <+++++> That's right, fella.
What was the fight about? <+++++> Take a guess.
You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it. <+++++> And?
Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us. <+++++> There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.
Wait a minute. This is the woman I love. What's going on? Who was loaded? <+++++> Don't worry. She's just a fan for my literary output.
Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow. <+++++> Sounds like a virus.
I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village? <+++++> Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...
It's getting quiet. <+++++> Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized...
Would you? <+++++> Uh huh.
I'll be back around nine. <+++++> Okay.
Later for you, Luke. <+++++> I got a question.
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them. They couldn't tell in the dark. <+++++> What are we going to do?
That ' s completely adorable! <+++++> It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
Cameron, I'm a little busy <+++++> It's off. The whole thing.
I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being. I'm going for a walk in the park. <+++++> Claire...!
--and none of 'em were mine! I-am-so-fucked, I-am-so-fucked-- where the hell was everybody?? ? <+++++> Asleep--
I did. You said, things were fine. <+++++> I remember.
But why? What's the point? <+++++> A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
Gee, I wonder why not. <+++++> I'm freezing my ass off.
Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia. <+++++> I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime? <+++++> Oh. I almost forgot. There is one last thing: Before Q retired, he asked that I give you one other protective device.
I like this music. <+++++> I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
About five months -- your months. <+++++> You must have come a long way.
I should be checking on the boat. <+++++> The war will still be here tomorrow.
The best times of my life, maybe. Just drinking and talking. Even over a phone. <+++++> Kindred spirits.
Now listen, Grampa. Listen to me, just a minute. <+++++> And I ain't gonna listen either. I tol' you what I'm gonna do.
You're not thinking of going after them, are you? <+++++> I am going after them.
Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together? <+++++> Because that would be too easy.
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect! You've never respected me! <+++++> Can we talk about this later? Everyone is watching!
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck. <+++++> Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
Well, it's up to Suzie. <+++++> It would be nice.
I'm sorry, ma'am? <+++++> Cold is good!
How are you, Jim? <+++++> Hey, listen, I hear you guys are sitting on something sensational over there.
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy. <+++++> Mustard's good on 'em to me.
Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft <+++++> Oh.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure. <+++++> I'll decide when it's exaggerated.
So help me, Gladys. <+++++> Becky was my only shot at state!
Fuckin' a right. <+++++> How would you like to go to the principal's office?
You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too? <+++++> I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began. And that's quite verifiable.
I only make love to the camera. <+++++> Simone, I recognize the shirt you're wearing. I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
I'm not leaving without that tape. <+++++> Don't push me, Frank. I might lose my temper and send it out just for spite.
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him -- <+++++> He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
Some weather we're having. Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral. You locked out of your apartment? <+++++> No, no. Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
Don't sell a guy one car. Sell him five cars over fifteen years. <+++++> That's right?
What time's he coming home? <+++++> When the game's over, I guess.
How is it you're good? You on a list? <+++++> Yeah. Ricky Slade.
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment. <+++++> I don't believe that, sir. WeÂve shared many disappointing journeys.
And how do we do that? <+++++> I don't know.
What was? <+++++> Dancing with you.
Why not? What's going to stop me? <+++++> You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
It's not our nature. It don't mean we're bad or nothing. We're just not so inclined. What about it? <+++++> Nothin'.
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway. <+++++> I'm frightened. I'm so frightened.
Can they be killed? <+++++> These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own.
Oh no...I think there's carrots in here... <+++++> Send it back if you don't want it.
That's it? <+++++> Bontecou wants a quick response and --
What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat? <+++++> You. What' you're doing --
Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night. <+++++> I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak. My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.
Well that's a ... long story ... <+++++> Well, I could ... free up some time...
I want to show you something. <+++++> You have to do something for me first.
Joey... <+++++> 
Mm. MM. Now these eggs got some kick to it. What'chu got in this? <+++++> Ask the chef.
Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you canÂt satisfy him? <+++++> You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
This is the home of an angel. <+++++> You OK out there?
We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in. They're in the far corner of the room under the windows. <+++++> There's some film cans in the far corner of the room underneath one of the windows.
If you want me to. <+++++> I'm always open to learning new things.
I know what you went through tonight. I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently. <+++++> Why did you come in here?
How d'you mean? <+++++> Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
G'day, they say it's worth three grand... <+++++> Fucking Australians! I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
Oh, Mrs. Straub. May I introduce you to my wife? <+++++> Just call me Elisabeth.
Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you... <+++++> ...and the government.
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would. <+++++> And you'd like to see that?
What are you afraid of? I'm not going to hurt you! What's the matter with you? <+++++> I'm hysterical. I'm having hysterics. I'm hysterical. I can't stop. When I get like this, I can't stop.
What were you two fighting about? <+++++> He told me to go outside. "You may leave us now." It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be "the man."
Wanna play? <+++++> No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.
You've read it a hundred times. <+++++> I enjoy it.
How can the sphere do that? <+++++> I don't know, Beth. I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.
And where is it now? <+++++> In his office. I saw it this morning.
I'm not the pig you are. <+++++> Who?
Yes... <+++++> Call for help.
Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble. <+++++> You didn't get me in trouble.
She's a rare one. <+++++> How's business, Dave?
I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left. <+++++> She seemed upset.
Dad? ? <+++++> What?
I don't know. <+++++> If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
What are you doing in there? <+++++> I'll be out in a minute.
The CPU from the first terminator. <+++++> Son of a bitch, I knew it!
So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap? <+++++> That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more. <+++++> I'll no forget you.
It's designed purely as a defensive device. Call it a reasonable precaution. <+++++> Call it xenophobic paranoia. Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this?
Sit down. Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside. It's...no, sit down...Now talk to me. <+++++> I can't regotiate.
Why me...? <+++++> Why not you?
Finished your estimate? <+++++> Well, there's several ways to go .
Didn't you tell her? <+++++> I didn't tell anybody. I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by . . .
What are you getting at? <+++++> Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it! <+++++> Yes, boss.
Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say? <+++++> Sure.
I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. <+++++> Mr. Crawford asked my opinion. Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery. Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now-- <+++++> Black Dan'l?
I don't know. For helping me out. <+++++> Where did you get that thing?
You're Anthony? <+++++> Yeah.
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame. <+++++> Yah.
Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid .. <+++++> She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick? <+++++> Yep, you guessed it.
"Paid vindication"  That's what I call justice. <+++++> Justice, yes. Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
You knew it was me all along? <+++++> Please. You can't hide from me, sonny. I invented the questionnaire.
Courtyard? <+++++> Boys marching. Clapping in unison.
Tea... or whiskey? <+++++> ... both. Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use. <+++++> And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee. <+++++> Uh huh. So pee.
Yes, sir. <+++++> And, as for you, Bobby, you just moved up a notch. Your days of fighting for crumbs is through.
Oh Brad. <+++++> It's alright Janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.
Now you're using that word. <+++++> I could try and get a Western lawyer.
How's that working out for you? <+++++> What?
No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism. <+++++> That's right.
But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him. <+++++> Manifested?
Look at that. He's got four apes with him. <+++++> That's what I like about these guys, J.J... They always got protection against things we'd never do to 'em.
I don't... why... why do you do this? <+++++> I'm sorry this came up.
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect! <+++++> I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see.
Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what? <+++++> Nothing, it's just that's when things usually start to go wrong.
That's all for you, Sammy. <+++++> Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
DeLa, I'm aboard. As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!! ! <+++++> That's right. Money turns the wheel.
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would. <+++++> Those toenails dry yet? We got some dancin' to do.
Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car. <+++++> Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
You're upset, huh? <+++++> Upset. No. I never get upset about business.
Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say? <+++++> They want more time to think about investing.
I was trying to get out of something. <+++++> No! Tell me everything, Jimmy.
Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie. <+++++> And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.
Yeah. <+++++> You mind me asking: why the fuck?
Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police. <+++++> Don't do that! I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.
Sal Maguda. <+++++> He any good?
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal -- <+++++> Phenomenal at taking bribes, right?
Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers! <+++++> All right, all right. Keep quiet.
I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'? <+++++> Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
I have lived to see two things I never expected. An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage. <+++++> General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
What's the matter? <+++++> D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful. <+++++> A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
Of course. <+++++> And not too expensive.
Ayegor! Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can. <+++++> Yes, Master!
No. <+++++> None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse! <+++++> Don't let that worry you, Annette!
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty? <+++++> Twentyish. It isn't important.
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well. <+++++> And no one will know the truth.
Great! What is it? <+++++> It's a...full length life-size figure!
Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck. <+++++> You wanted to let Sonny handle it. I would've moved in when we first found out.
Then I suggest we start there. <+++++> Doesn't matter who she picks. No woman is going to last one week in a commando training course. And I don't care who it is.
What does it mean in the long run? The only important thing is to live well. And...  living					* well takes money. * <+++++> You're damaged goods, lady.
As it happens. I didn't make that part up. <+++++> And where is this guest? Don't they want to interview him.
What kind of joint are you running? <+++++> Sir?
Cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world. <+++++> The world of the dead?
Maybe these are not men - not like us. <+++++> Everything human don't have to look like you and me....
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains. Why don't you ask her about the gun? <+++++> I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am. <+++++> I'll have to know a little more than that.
There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe. <+++++> That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
Nothing. <+++++> Totally unrelated victims.
I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows. We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along. <+++++> No.
And how did you find his work? <+++++> It was good. He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
You got nothin' on me. <+++++> We'll get it, and if we can't, we'll just make it up. Grand larceny, extortion. Counterfeiting, anything you want.
You... you think I saved your... life. I can't take advantage.... <+++++> You did save my life! And it's <u>me</u>!
Don't care for cold steel? A knife is worse than a bullet? <+++++> I don't know.
You never sang before? <+++++> Not for money. With my mother.
How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law. <+++++> I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>. <+++++> Suit yourself.
So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy. <+++++> You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
Rita. Pass the wine. <+++++> Why you drinking so much?
Why were Lefferts' eyes black? <+++++> I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket. She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
What? <+++++> I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce. He looked like such a dope. <+++++> I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me. <+++++> Okay.
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to? <+++++> Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby.
I'm a writer. Ted O Â <+++++> Think about it, Fink. Writers come and go; we always need Indians.
Why? <+++++> Don't ask questions. Just be there.
I don't like nobody drawin' a bead on me. <+++++> Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?
No. Just the coffee. <+++++> We'll take our check.
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels... <+++++> Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
Where's all your things, Jeffrey? <+++++> This is it.
Right, right, what am I thinking of? <+++++> I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer. At least tell me the bomb is still going off. <+++++> They haven't found it yet -- Listen, Pollux ...
You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on? <+++++> Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
So, in reality, you and I are in the same business! <+++++> Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
Yeah, we have something great, Vick. <+++++> Kevin... I want to have sex with you.
And when did you last see Signor Ripley? <+++++> A few days ago.
Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics. <+++++> That's not necessarily a bad thing.
I suppose I tried. <+++++> You tried.
Well we're not friends. <+++++> You got that right. And we ain't brothers. Maybe we should just end this right here.
Skinny? <+++++> We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones.
Where you going? <+++++> Got to talk to the brothers.
Bullshit! <+++++> I swear...
I know. <+++++> Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
Here. Why am I looking at this star? <+++++> Because I had it named for you. I know it's not an official designation --
I'm getting worried about you. You ought to have a checkup. <+++++> Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
The only girlish thing you have lost. <+++++> Sam. This is the last time.
Good morning, Helen. <+++++> Good morning.
I don't like being handled. <+++++> Sit on it! <u>Now</u> look.
Roger. <+++++> We all set?
And one of 'em is sick. <+++++> Why didn't you say so. Go right out and get her. Ed. build the fire up.
Certainly not! <+++++> Divorce? An alcoholic relative? Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change. You always do. <+++++> I just - hate it when they're - finished.
I have to go home. Chet might call. <+++++> It's just for a little while. You promised.
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it. <+++++> I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
How did I get here last night? <+++++> No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
What's the matter? What's the matter with you? You look pale. You okay? <+++++> I'm-I'm okay. Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.
Baby... <+++++> You did, I know you did.
Vince is getting desperate. Where is she, Eddie? Where'd you stash her? <+++++> Where's who?
Charley... . Charley... . Wow... . <+++++> I wish I didn't have to do this, Terry.
Charlie... <+++++> It's Nuwanda.
 <+++++> Uh-huh.
Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case. <+++++> Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
Mayo, are those your friends? <+++++> Yes, sir!
Hear you got a Boy's Club back home! Any ideas? Going to make things hum in the Senate, huh? <+++++> Hold on, fellows--I'm not used to more then one question at a time--
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you? <+++++> No.
I think they got me. <+++++> They got the bull-fiddle.
Pour that back. <+++++> What.
Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal. <+++++> That's yes?
You find any work? <+++++> Maybe. Met a guy named Red, owns a garage, could have some work in about a week.
What's your favorite scary movie? <+++++> Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
That's not your line. <+++++> Say you love me.
What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I? <+++++> You can help her.
The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged. Even marriage. You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood. <+++++> Yes...he's wonderful...
What you goin' to do? <+++++> Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...
What's that mean? <+++++> Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that.
What's her greatest fear? <+++++> Her brother.
So you're saying as long as that door stays locked, we're okay? <+++++> Hell NO!! The House will kill ya!
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes. <+++++> It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
It's the least I could do... considering I got you into this mess with those reports. <+++++> No. I mean it, thank you.
Are you running a high fever, man? How could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed? How could you even conceive of it? <+++++> I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
I requested it because I believe in this cause and this is where I can do the most good. <+++++> Oh?
Honey, he wasn't right for you. <+++++> I know.
Someone looking after her little girl? <+++++> Grandparents. Live over in Davis.
Yes. <+++++> This building is not secure.
Excuse me? <+++++> I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin... <+++++> Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
Nobody's going to do that! <+++++> Really?
Goodbye. <+++++> Call me later.
Daniel! ... You must go to sleep. <+++++> I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
How long has he been with you? <+++++> Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
Fine. <+++++> I believe in heaven. You people believe in heaven?
And are the police aware you dated the victim? <+++++> What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
Miss Scott, you're not making any sense. <+++++> I'm afraid they'll kill them! We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out!
I like change. You know, constant turnover. As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios. <+++++> Use 'em and lose 'em.
It's not that simple. Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir. <+++++> Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
I want ice! Who's got some--  Oh, there it is. <+++++> It's on the table, Dad.
You were right. Del wasn't lying. <+++++> Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
Yum, yum. <+++++> Well, he must like the way he looks. He's got a mirror in every room.
Ma didn't want it around. After. <+++++> Oh.
Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben? <+++++> Deb, it's me. It's still me.
Come Here. <+++++> What are you going to do. bleed on me?
You know, Fred, they sell tickets. <+++++> Sir?
I guess this is a first for you. <+++++> No, I've been excited before.
What name? My name? <+++++> It's not your given name, right?
You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over. <+++++> What do you need?
It's going to be for alternative arts, but I need some help to finish it off, can you put the word out? <+++++> Sure. Excellent.
I've been going to debtor's anonymous. You want to see some truly fucked up people? <+++++> I'm just on my way out...
Well, it's probably because it would help him. <+++++> How is that?
About what? <+++++> About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works. <+++++> Be downstairs. You're beautiful.
Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day. <+++++> Do you get paid a lot?
Did you talk about Miss Lawson? <+++++> Yes.
Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery? <+++++> Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services.
I'll get something for us to drink -- <+++++> Don't bother!
What are they doing in Los Feliz? <+++++> Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
Is it time? D'you have to leave for the funeral? <+++++> Not yet, there's plenty of time.
What generation are you? <+++++> Nexus - 6.
 <+++++> I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
What's Beynon got set up? <+++++> Small town, small bank, big money.
He is the Destructor. <+++++> Really? Can't wait to meet him.
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening? <+++++> Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
Because you'd laugh. <+++++> I won't, I swear.
Your fellow hero, untouched... <+++++> ...and unharmed, de-...
Please don't move, don't go anywhere. <+++++> *Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something.
Yeah, just trying to handle some year old twinkies. Yucck. What do they put in these things? <+++++> 'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink. <+++++> Say, listen--
Shhhhhhh! <+++++> That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
I'm gonna take a walk. I need some money. <+++++> You'll have money when you work.
He deserved it. <+++++> Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.
You can't know for certain that he won't see you. <+++++> Trust me, Violet.
Right. <+++++> This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love.
But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals. <+++++> They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
The bedroom. <+++++> There is only one bed.
Right. What about sweating Lecktor? <+++++> They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student. He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition. <+++++> Super...man. Hmmm...
Are you peeking? <+++++> Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
Hot damn, Drag. Tomorrow's Saturday. Another week almost made. <+++++> I got two years.
I said hold on! <+++++> Could you hurry up, please... it's kinda hot out here.
Is it morning yet? <+++++> No, honey. Go back to sleep.
I need to know that. <+++++> You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.
That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam. <+++++> Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue--
What the fuck? Is he going to walk? <+++++> He's going down, George. It's election year. We're not making any deals.
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think? <+++++> No it's not!
It's a one-on-one kind of date thing. <+++++> With who?
Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas. In one of those chapels. He can meet us there. <+++++> Yeah, he'll really go for that.
Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building. <+++++> So? DOUG Well, there's tons of empty buildings - why don't we get one?
George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream. <+++++> What did you say?
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment -- <+++++> Let me help you.
Couldn't sleep. <+++++> Good.
Yes, Leon... <+++++> What is it, my boy?
No, no, it's not possible. <+++++> Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance? <+++++> Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.
... Stan, I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million. <+++++> Now come on here, no way, Wade! No way!
...Words to live by? <+++++> Your choice. Look at the time! Come. There's someone I want you meet - about a story I'm thinking of publishing.
You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy-- <+++++> Buddy Deeds--
What's that? <+++++> You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?
Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to -- <+++++> We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --
! <+++++> Yes, it's a miracle.
I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton. <+++++> This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final. You will cease pursuing this matter.
There's Times Square. <+++++> You can almost spit on it, can't you?
It's him! <+++++> No, honey, it's the police. Hello, officers.
Is Valentine here? <+++++> What do you think?
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action. <+++++> Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
Precisely. But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided. That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state. <+++++> ... Want 'em to go apeshit. Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies.
You want her right now? <+++++> Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here! <+++++> Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
I don't want to remember! <+++++> Stop fighting.
I was thinking Las Vegas. Get some butts in those seats. <+++++> And what next? Popcorn? Curtain calls? This is not a theater. or a casino.
It will grow back again! <+++++> But it wasn't always so! I had a mother once! And Louis - he had a wife! He was mortal the same as she!
Why? Am I some kind of freak to you or something? <+++++> No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it...  Do you think I'm a freak?
Are your parents alive? <+++++> Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend. <+++++> South African women are very sporty.
Tight security. No guns. Real plus. <+++++> If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me.
I'll take him over mine. <+++++> What?
Again. <+++++> Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
No you're not. <+++++> I will be in three months. I can't wait. I hate being eleven. It has to be the stupidest age in the world.
Keep absolutely still - - it's vision's based on movement! <+++++> You're sure? !
Hello Martin. How have you been? <+++++> Not bad. You?
You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column. <+++++> Supposing that man had hurt you? Is it worth risking your life over ten dollars, two credit cards, and a lipstick?
Not so scared. <+++++> Perhaps not. You seem to have misplaced a private. No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young -- <+++++> And that's what you've heard?
Ehh. <+++++> "Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
Oww! <+++++> Careful. What's wrong?
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there? <+++++> What?
Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick. What's going on? <+++++> I'm not sick.
"My"... <+++++> Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
Walter -- <+++++> Don't call me that.
 <+++++> 
What? <+++++> Look! Janie!
Yes. <+++++> Does it make you... hard?
Dreyfuss. <+++++> Get more coffee.
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs. <+++++> That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside.
Silly, silly, silly. <+++++> I think I should call someone.
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic. <+++++> Do you know how I define "idealism," Monsieur DelbenÃ¨?
10,000 M.S.L., Admiral. <+++++> Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
He said he'd... look into it. I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns. <+++++> How's Mr. Parker doing?
Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head. <+++++> Might be different in New York.
Except yourself! <+++++> Will you wait a minute?
What? <+++++> Will you marry me?
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens. <+++++> Yeah. I guess I did. What's going to happen to me?
But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself. I did not know that one kiss could matter so much. <+++++> We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  "Oh, my God.
So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs. <+++++> Hey, look!
And what about screaming? <+++++> I said: I DON'T KNOW. You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
An Aryan Warrior with black teardrops painted on his face. <+++++> "Painted"?
I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night? <+++++> No, Ben.
oh. <+++++> She didn't wanna miss out on anything...especially motherhood...it got to be a real problem with us.
Don't try to stop me! <+++++> But that's not a door. The door's over there.
A hotel? <+++++> It's a knocking-shop. Tres discreet, huh? He visits his ladies on Tuesday and Thursday nights and Saturday mornings.
I love you. <+++++> That's nice. Are you drunk?
He's marvelous! <+++++> Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me-- <+++++> You don't want to be Sheriff.
Look, I told you I'm not going to college. <+++++> Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.
You think this is all very funny. <+++++> A little.

The thing's kind of heavy. <+++++> Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
And I guess we didn't talk about money. So, I'll just dive in -- <+++++> Give me your number. I'll call tomorrow. I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it. <+++++> Well, then, I know it takes three -- four weeks for you to come round to admit when you're wrong...
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten -- <+++++> I don't care -- he's manipulating it. That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
You're a big help. <+++++> Alright, the beige one.
Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk. <+++++> You ain't getting out of that trunk.
Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle. <+++++> What Truth?
Fuck you. <+++++> Not anymore you don't. Doll.
Have a shot? <+++++> What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets. <+++++> Would you be satisfied if I said I shot him?
Man if you want to be a legit artist you have to do nudes, nudes, nudes... <+++++> Right. Ain't no body of work complete without some... nudes -
I'm tired of playing overseas. Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile. <+++++> A rest?
As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate-- <+++++> Surely My pleasure, Miss Davies..
Shall we give it a name? <+++++> Dave.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa. <+++++> How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
Madonna's in Penthouse? <+++++> Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell.
What Hotel are you staying at? <+++++> And what are you? A cop?
Excuse me, do you have... <+++++> To the back, above the oil. How long are you staying?
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing. The Dragon rampant. Do you see? <+++++> Yes.
They're not staying to stop this thing. They're gonna fly right out of here with their people. <+++++> Their people?
I am sorry, it's so embarassing. <+++++> How about you? Will you be alright?
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter. <+++++> No, no bible readers.
You want me to hold him down? <+++++> That's right, Stud, hold me down.
The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts. <+++++> Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?
Nobody else is going down but me, okay? <+++++> Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting? <+++++> I can live with "great."
I heard. <+++++> I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
No. This is a set up. <+++++> ThatÂs quick.
No, I am not going to -- <+++++> Okay. Eyes closed, mind a blank. I'm all yours. Do it, Rosen.
Are you in the book? <+++++> Charles is.
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy. <+++++> What's his name?
You're a damn liar. <+++++> You _took_ me, you bastard, and now I'm taking you.
I might make him nervous. <+++++> You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive. <+++++> I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
Yes. <+++++> How are things going at school?
No. <+++++> Will you please come in?
Are you Annie? <+++++> Yes.
Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way. <+++++> I've never been so hungry in my life...
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come. <+++++> It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.
Thank you. <+++++> Thank you? Dick, sometimes I understand why they hate you.
C'mere. You got some good blow, right? <+++++> Yeah.
Where? <+++++> Not yet.
At the Airport? Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we... <+++++> No, no, no, no, no <u>after</u> the airport.
I know all about how you threatened him. That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble. <+++++> Oh?
On his day off. Get the exact address. <+++++> Okay...
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart. <+++++> And sexy.
I'm Sheriff Deeds-- <+++++> Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
What fire and music? <+++++> You wouldn't understand. How was Miss Caswell?
You believe that? <+++++> Why not?
Jake. <+++++> I'm the one who wanted to study it....
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy. <+++++> Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce. Well, I see you have a camera.
Well... Sort of... <+++++> We have become aware of these concepts only recently. In our dealings with Sarris. Often Sarris will say one thing, and do another.
... Yes? <+++++> First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
So, you're not a dyke. <+++++> Not tonight.
Jennifer, you want to have another drink? <+++++> Hey, I know how to have a burger by myself. I feel like a little solitude.
What do you mean? <+++++> You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar? <+++++> Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
Yeah, buddy? <+++++> Can you borrow me a dime?
No, not my girl. Self-control, she had. Point of pride. And people don't change, do they. <+++++> I dunno ... Maybe they do.
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter. <+++++> I'll say goodnight again.
Did you get the letter? <+++++> What letter?
So. Is he any good? <+++++> No. Not yet he isn't.
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough. <+++++> You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago. <+++++> I like it. It's... sexy.
I'm sure. And Kate, thank you for coming. Thank you for being such a good friend. <+++++> I'll be back before you leave.
What? <+++++> He plays it all the time.
Answer the question. <+++++> Look in the mirror. ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros. How much you got saved?
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why? <+++++> Ben did this.
Please, call me Gale. <+++++> Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now. <+++++> Did you hear? Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
We could've gone out the back! You didn't have to shoot! <+++++> Stop it! They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
Yeah. <+++++> And the other person I just fucked, which was a mistake. But I went to the clinic last week with Jennie.
Oh, leave me alone. <+++++> One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time? I know. <+++++> Are you losing money?
Then why aren't you eating? <+++++> Would that I could.
Oh. <+++++> You know who it once belonged to?
No. <+++++> Next, please.
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny? <+++++> No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
Leave me alone. <+++++> Dad says!
You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola. <+++++> Sure, I remember Tom from the old days.
Did you hear that? <+++++> Hear what?
No -- you don't have to -- <+++++> Oh. I thought... you lead me --
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station. <+++++> Well, let's go get it. We also gotta get rid of all those cars. It looks like Sam's hot car lot outside.
Who? <+++++> It's me...
I tried... <+++++> Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you. Understand? Understand?
Oh, is that what it is? <+++++> Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
Where does he live? <+++++> He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad.
They were <u>mythic</u>. They had a poetry to them. And you know what else? The women prefer the traditional monsters. <+++++> The <u>women</u>?
It's a bluff. The guy's full of crap. <+++++> We can't take the chance. Ring down to the Bomb Squad. I want them on alert.
It is a beautiful day. I am merely enjoying it. <+++++> Can't you enjoy it quietly?
What are you doing? <+++++> Let's go. Come on.
What difference does it make? <+++++> Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention. That's bad. And that's not good...
Much. <+++++> Is the dizziness gone?
Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor. What do you think that crowd is doing down there? They think you murdered him. <+++++> Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket?
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die! <+++++> I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.
I think he means the Kennedy assassination. <+++++> Yeah?
That ain't funny. <+++++> DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone! <+++++> Maybe it had something to do.
Mother, get a rope! <+++++> Oh, my God, look at her!
I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I? <+++++> Not at all...
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle? <+++++> Brutal frankness, if you insist.
Eight scientists. Eight different fields of endeavor. Hydraulics, optics, ballistics... <+++++> Put them all together and what do we have?
And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ... <+++++> Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
Was I a really busy guy? Did I do Tick too? <+++++> You bet. Did you like it?
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl? <+++++> Probably. Every woman in my life was divorced at least twice. What was I supposed to say. Anthropologist?
It's engineered to last about fifteen years. <+++++> Things. Oh--you silly people and your things. Things, things, things.
For calling you a homo. <+++++> That was out of line.
Oh! <+++++> I thought just earplugs.
By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested. <+++++> I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls. I was merely a spectator.
Do you consider that a compliment? <+++++> No.
Hm? <+++++> You know, clean the pipes.
You're kidding. <+++++> Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray. <+++++> Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy. <+++++> What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
All week? <+++++> I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
What? That new mystery girl you've been seeing? <+++++> No. I'll tell you sometime. Not now. Don't want to jinx it.
Cost less. That's the point. <+++++> Is it December?
Oh! <+++++> Hey, sorry... He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.
Thanks, thanks. <+++++> I hope you'll be very happy.
Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed. <+++++> What?
Just go off. I'll be quite all right. <+++++> 
Honest to goodness, I hate you. <+++++> And don't make it too dreary. How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes. He teaches at night. Right?
Fine. I'll say no. <+++++> They're putting me on film tomorrow.
What am I doing here? <+++++> Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
Replacement party. <+++++> Who's that?
You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion. <+++++> I'd never get an abortion.
Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore. <+++++> Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
What did it cost? <+++++> Fifteen dollars.
Me? <+++++> Yes. Could you give me some information?
Healy you dog! <+++++> Fucking Sully! Look at you!
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer. <+++++> He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
Okay, we're square now, right? <+++++> There's just one more thing I need you to do.
Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but... <+++++> What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
I read an article about this ... <+++++> I read the same article...
Do you recognize this young man? <+++++> Nope. Is there a prob-...
Yeah. <+++++> It feels like you're in France.
How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel. <+++++> Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but we'll try her.
So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target. You'll get yourself killed. Just keep talking. <+++++> I will. Inside. There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
Happily. <+++++> ... Kids?
Watch it! <+++++> Recognizers!
You're just going to lock the store like that? <+++++> I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed.
You don't have secrets from me. <+++++> It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
Tom, let's spend the night here. <+++++> There's no motels around here.
I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily... <+++++> Then how come you're not with him?
But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up. <+++++> I don't grow up any more. I just get older.
Be good and be smart, little boy. <+++++> Yes, ma'm...
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now. <+++++> If you're thinking of that thousand dollars, forget it. It's practically gone. We owed everybody in town.
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point. <+++++> Which apartment?
Hey! What's the idea...? <+++++> Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight...
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven. <+++++> I'm very confused.
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me? <+++++> Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
I'm free every evening, every week- end. If you want, we could work at your place. <+++++> It's just impossible.
Because it's in The Big Chill. <+++++> Haven't seen it.
I mean... how could you do that? <+++++> I didn't know it would get sent. I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and...
This is how you pick up women -- <+++++> -- No.
You're too kind. <+++++> How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
Incestuous. <+++++> Every person's got their own kinks, beef-cake. What's wrong, Kittle? You don't swing?
They would have killed this man? <+++++> People get hysterical enough, they do anything.
Where... can I stay? <+++++> First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on. After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich.
Could I trouble you for some water? <+++++> Yes, of course. So, golly, where have you come from?
I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket? <+++++> Of course.
Or at least I think it was Ringo. It might have been that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,' Toppy. <+++++> Topol.
Yes, sir. You're just what we needed on a night like this. <+++++> Uh ... thanks.
I pay my debts. <+++++> You do?
I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking. I don't like to lose. <+++++> Then -- you never faced that situation -- faced death...
Good. I'm going to need your support. <+++++> Can't you just quit? Walk away?
Poor Harry. Always desperate for attention. What about the bunny? <+++++> Back to the lab. Harry'll probably lose his scholarship.
That's right, fella, no Hearst paper will run an RKO ad until you agree that CITIZEN KANE will never see the light of day. <+++++> Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
-- I want you to understand. <+++++> Yes -- I do understand.
What is it? <+++++> I have no idea. Are you ready?
I'm going to marry Walter. I just have to get this out of my system. <+++++> Right.
Who did you hear it from? <+++++> I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them! Do you know Dmitri?
If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself. <+++++> That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
What do you mean? Claremont didn't provide them? <+++++> No. What's the big deal?
Who the hell are you? <+++++> Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
Oh yes, I'm John Triplette. <+++++> I'm gathering information about the characteristics of music people. I just finished a documentary on Gandi.
Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say! <+++++> Hey Geraldine, let's eat!
But Charles' appointment was last week, not -- <+++++> I know, but this is all we've got left.
I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I -- <+++++> Well when can we do something?
You're going to let them get away with this? <+++++> We've almost got your husband and your daughter out. So don't get any ideas.
What did you do tonight? <+++++> I watched TV.
Why? <+++++> Our profession needs talent like yours. Destroy your career over an issue of pride? What a waste.
Like? <+++++> Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry. And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.
I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz. <+++++> First, I would like to say I love the show. It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.
Let me know if you need anything, okay? <+++++> Are you and Larry happy?
He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he? <+++++> So what?
I'll do it. <+++++> I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect. <+++++> Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
Will you please come in? <+++++> Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
"He's gonna croon love's tune, <+++++> "Honeymoon,
Sure did. He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road. <+++++> Was there any trouble?
Did you bring Bob's weights? <+++++> They're coming Fedex...
You tricked me... <+++++> Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve... I'm afraid... he's out.
Tell me. <+++++> I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere? <+++++> What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
Where did you hear that name? <+++++> Well, isn't it -- ?
Wha? <+++++> I hereby name this star Fred.
Thirty -- sometimes fifty. <+++++> You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron.
Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep. <+++++> There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy.
Y'what? <+++++> You two have never had a quarrel in your life and in two minutes flat he's got you at it. He's a king mixer.
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok. <+++++> Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
I'm fine. <+++++> Okay, good, this is all very noble.
Would you like to come in? <+++++> I'd be delighted.
Then you got undressed. <+++++> How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
Been a while since I stocked a wire store. Not many mobs playing that anymore. <+++++> All we need is the bookie setup for now. We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride? <+++++> You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
You admit you're lying? <+++++> I admit I don't know where he is.
I don't remember the name. It was near a beach. <+++++> Sunnyridge. That was a long time
You mean you blew it. <+++++> Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
Yeah. Too good. I forgot where I was. <+++++> Occupational hazard?
I like him a lot. <+++++> Well listen to me.
Well... there's one indoors now. I've brought her back to see you. <+++++> You've what?
I don't trust you enough."? Maybe I shoulda, but I couldn't. <+++++> Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
 <+++++> You were pretty bad, huh?
You're ayip! <+++++> Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right?
I have some very good memories there. <+++++> What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
Take it easy. Just take it easy. We're here to do business. <+++++> You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
But you must! <+++++> The numbers simply don't mean anything
Their stories are just fear and folklore. <+++++> Maybe... but how do you explain The Thuggee shrine I saw right below the palace?
I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge. <+++++> Will this thing take long?
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on... <+++++> Hesitates. Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack. Finds the morphine.
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy! <+++++> Of course. I'm a terminator.
Can you pay some attention to me? <+++++> Oh, yes.
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round. <+++++> Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough.
Brave, Sir Rob ... <+++++> Shut up.
I'm on the staff of... <+++++> Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right?
You can't talk that way about my movie. <+++++> "Your movie"?! I wish it was your movie! I wish I hadn't blown every dime I ever made into this stinkbomb.
Never heard of it. <+++++> Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
...your concern nor your fight. Relinquish the package and you can go. <+++++> I don't know what the hell...
Because I'm happy. <+++++> You're happy?
What about? <+++++> About your brother. And the deeeep shit he's in --
Sure, all drifters do. <+++++> Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming. <+++++> You're imagining it.
All right, Father, I'll ask him! If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen? <+++++> Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
Well, I guess that's all till tomorrow. <+++++> Okay, thanks very much.
You're drunk. <+++++> You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
Has she returned to her husband? <+++++> No, she's with her sister,
Because I'm still scared! <+++++> Oh, come on.
I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill. <+++++> Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
Do you still want the peanut butter, bread and cigarettes ? <+++++> Yes. What? Yes.
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates . <+++++> Listen to you! You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Tired... <+++++> That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain.
Why is everything an argument with you? <+++++> I'm just setting my boundaries.
It is sacrilege! <+++++> I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want. <+++++> I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
What the hell do you want? <+++++> I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -
It's the generator I think! No power. <+++++> Well, let's get down there.
Time to go. <+++++> I can't eject.
You know damn well about what. You let them take it out of here. <+++++> For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.
I try to be. <+++++> Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before? <+++++> I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them. <+++++> Did you try?
Why can't things stay the way they are...everything has to change. What we had was perfect. <+++++> I don't know. Here, lay down and get some rest. We're going to need it.
What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...? You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber. <+++++> ...you want us to go to War with Albania.
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill. <+++++> Any clue as to what it is?
Really, why? Sorry, I'm completely lost. <+++++> I know. I'm lost, too.
Two suits by tomorrow for $400? <+++++> An even five I throw in the jacket.
Sean, this is ridiculous. You're acting very immature. <+++++> I'm not acting! I don't want to go in it, okay?
So waddaya feel like doing tonight? <+++++> I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
All this goes on Underhill's bill? <+++++> I saved his life during the war.
I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids. <+++++> The kid needs a man to show him --
There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours? <+++++> A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. I can't even remember.
What I'd like to do--- <+++++> How 'bout Manson?
It won't work -- <+++++> It will and you know why?
The Admiral's son. <+++++> Don't you believe it.
In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE! ! <+++++> Honey, we went over this in therapy.
I want you to leave. Then maybe... <+++++> We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks.
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it. <+++++> What're you talkin' about?
No. <+++++> You weren't attracted to him at all?
How are you, Bill? <+++++> Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
Oh, please-- <+++++> It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
Very very. The photographs? <+++++> Don't worry. I'll ask you to do me a favor. You'll get the negatives and everything back then.
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature. <+++++> I wouldn't talk.
No! No... What did you have in mind...? <+++++> A moment alone, please.
You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box. <+++++> I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
How about you and your sister? <+++++> We're okay.
Can you feel that? <+++++> No. Try a little higher.
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid. <+++++> How is everything?
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school. <+++++> Explain how that works.
How'd you get in here. <+++++> Walked.
Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately. <+++++> Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
Shut up. <+++++> Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
I'm frightened. I'm so frightened. <+++++> Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
No thanks. <+++++> So what should I do with the pudding?
Senator's son? <+++++> No, three brothers of his were killed in action. Command wants him out of there.
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf. <+++++> YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...
Have you taken leave of your senses? <+++++> I have. Sit down over there.
About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown. We don't want to end up like the rest of the country. <+++++> They never found Dad's body--maybe somehow--
I walk differently? <+++++> I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
I had not the slightest inkling. Why didn't you say so? <+++++> She doesn't care! She's not married any more! She's going to have fun!
Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing? <+++++> Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
It's getting exciting now. <+++++> That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way.
No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough -- <+++++> -- enough time tomorrow. I know.
Do we know it's him using the beacon? Not a decoy? <+++++> Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie. <+++++> I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
Thank you, Miss -- ? <+++++> Lyla Devereux.
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent. <+++++> It makes you tell the truth?
Generally known! What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots? <+++++> Please don't misunderstand. I am grateful for your hospitality and --
Lay them down. <+++++> Eh?
I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie. You haven't got any idea - <+++++> Rogers, I don't think I will postpone doing something about you until I'm elected. To start with, I'll break your neck.
What's that, Diz ? <+++++> That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you? <+++++> Watch the store while I go home and change.
Congratulations. I heard about that. <+++++> YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
You, you just need a new flint, General. <+++++> You are never, never to touch my guns! Do you understand! ?
...I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat. When we catch him, you gotta let me kill him! <+++++> We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over.
Ha! ! <+++++> But ... I called Central Services.
Why? <+++++> Why not?
I'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. I couldn't get out. <+++++> It was probably the wind.
You're making it too easy. <+++++> You got time on your side. Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.
And? <+++++> We've been notified that they rejected the sentence...
The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here? <+++++> No. Then they were led by his underlings.
You won't remember! <+++++> When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different!
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh? <+++++> Yes, I've seen it. And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
Of what? <+++++> That Dillinger's on to him.
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada? <+++++> No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
A great deal. They designed and build Tiger's chariot... <+++++> They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
I can help them! <+++++> You're not ready yet. You still have much to learn.
There is, but it's not that interesting. <+++++> So where have you been staying?
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker. <+++++> That's all? Thirty each. That's all it took for you to murder her?
He's preaching. <+++++> Punishing.
Alex. <+++++> Hullo love, how are you? Nice to see you, Dad.
You're worrying about its killing someone else? <+++++> Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
Goodnight. <+++++> Romeo, I drink to thee.
F for... <+++++> Fabulous!
But where are you going? <+++++> I'm thirsty.
Miles. <+++++> I think a nursery should be right off the master suite. My parents put mine in the guest house.
Lost something? <+++++> What makes you think that! If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, Bumstead...
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process. <+++++> Yes, I'm having trouble controlling... THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
That's the point. <+++++> I don't get you, King.
[We page him and he calls back on this cell phone.] <+++++> [What is his name?]
The woman I saw you with... <+++++> Just a friend. We have friends, too, you know.
I don't know. It probably would've been the same. <+++++> Well, thanks a lot.
I see. The verdict, yes... <+++++> Wait, this isn't fair...
I'm here, aren't I? <+++++> I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other. <+++++> How'm I doing so far?
The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily. <+++++> How long is temporarily? I trust not until July.
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States. <+++++> Could be ten or fifteen. Maybe even twenty.
She was taken. <+++++> Did you --
No. I expect you can't. <+++++> And this is your house. Wow. The house of Frankenstein. I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
They're going to come to everyone. <+++++> Why would I do it?
Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best. <+++++> You knew him best.
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude. <+++++> Uh-huh.
See? No code. What'd I say? <+++++> Codes are for <u>hiding</u> information. So it's making a mistake. It's making a code without intending to.
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day. She called him by a nickname. Muns or Lunts or something. <+++++> Stens? Was it Stens?
Try Cates. And let's talk in private, okay? <+++++> Sure, anything you want.
And Fridays? What do you do then? <+++++> Nothing. I go to bird shops on Fridays.
You're very handy, I can tell. I bet you like to read a lot, too. <+++++> Print is dead.
I'm not going! <+++++> What are you talking about?
Kiki? <+++++> It's all right. I'm not hurt.
Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em. <+++++> Ca-na-da...
Sell maps? <+++++> What of?
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out. <+++++> The moon?
Our habitat, I mean. This place can't handle another attack. <+++++> Another attack?
Veronica. What are you doing tonight? <+++++> Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
I'm waiting for the phone. <+++++> Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
What did he say? <+++++> It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all...
Can I talk to you? When you're there. <+++++> Always. Always. And you won't hear a voice. But in <u>here</u>. You'll know.
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat. <+++++> What happened in those three minutes...?
No I just....I don't want to, I just want to be connected to talk to a girl. <+++++> It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off! <+++++> But the tremors have stopped.
I know. But you've never met. It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him. <+++++> Ha.
So? <+++++> So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
I have confirmed the location, sir, but... <+++++> What is it?
Shook me up. I mean that you knew her and everything -- <+++++> I didn't know her. The body I took knew her. The man she met in the coffee shop this morning.
They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet? Milo? <+++++> I met this girl.
Why, pray tell? <+++++> Because John said I mustn't.
But, Dad, we... <+++++> Megan, take your friends back to the camp. I'll let you know if I hear anything about your counselors.
Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor. <+++++> He was not family. Family is all that matters.
Depends on the state. <+++++> Arizona.
I was, uh, one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement.--The original Port Huron Statement. <+++++> Uh-huh.
Probably. <+++++> Who?
Does he know about what happened? <+++++> Yeah. Sit down a second. There's something I need to tell you about Steven...
And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy. <+++++> I am a nice guy, Daniel. With a job to do. You know how it is.
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed. <+++++> Lucky guess. And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed. <+++++> All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room.
Uh-huh. <+++++> You don't still think it was me?
Should do something to them. <+++++> What?
I think you'd better leave now. <+++++> You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call? !
Thank God for that. <+++++> Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you. <+++++> What's up?
He's makin' threats in there. <+++++> He's scared. It's crazy. I never met anyone like him. His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children.
We haven't talked since high school. <+++++> Yeah. I'll go check on your boy.
If only these coins purchased your other talents, too. <+++++> There's something else I want from you.
You're Delbert Miles! You have more clout than some whacked out pilot! Talk to him! <+++++> Talk to him...Jesus...
Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better. <+++++> I can take care of myself.
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away? <+++++> I didn't run away. I left the flat.
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag? <+++++> Gimme that bag before I knock you out and take it.
Get the girl back under. Keep going. <+++++> SULEIMAN!
In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that. <+++++> Who was the friend?
Wait... <+++++> Shh. It's okay.
Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |Shelly's books to figure out how he did it. <+++++> Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Do you have any idea what you are saying? You are asking me to help you fuck the mob.
Uh huh. <+++++> I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
Billy Prince is asking you to prom. <+++++> Why?
Hi, honey, how's Donna? <+++++> Fine.
He's here. <+++++> Anderton, leave.
When are you coming home? <+++++> Tomorrow.
There was nothing I could do. Batman deactivated her. She's dead. <+++++> You lie!
I don't think so. <+++++> Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute?
Then you can't come in. <+++++> I have an appointment.
Sorry I'm late. <+++++> You're not.
You mean get off my own land? <+++++> Now don't go blaming me. It ain't *my* fault.
Uh. huh. <+++++> It's interesting.
Um, I guess -- <+++++> Good. And one more thing. I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
We can always do that, Duff. <+++++> Yeah. Yeah, I know. I'm not really thinkin' about it.
She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan. <+++++> You learned her lessons better than I.
Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday. <i>Five</i> hours. Asking all kinds of questions... <+++++> He's asking everybody questions.
This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you? <+++++> Wolfi!
There's somebody in the house, Jack... <+++++> Wait for the back-up! Will?
What are you saying? <+++++> This means they've given up trying to break the picket line. Now we can all fight together -- all of us.
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. <+++++> I want to be alone --
Well, uh... good luck. I hope you won't need me, but if you do, I'm here. <+++++> Right.
No. <+++++> You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important. <+++++> No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books. <+++++> All right, let's go.
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows... <+++++> It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
Look, John, I'm facing it. <+++++> I'm not waiting until it's too late.
It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters. <+++++> Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
Hey, how about that! <+++++> We could show 'em we're friendly, huh? Walk out there with a white flag! Here - I got an old sugar sack in my car!
You sure talk like a girl who's been married. <+++++> Sam!
She didn't see. <+++++> That doesn't matter.
What can I do but beseech you...? Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...? When...? <+++++> He treated me as if I were a child...
But you found another choice. <+++++> I did.
Steven -- <+++++> -- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank. <+++++> Lives and learns doesn't one.
I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable. <+++++> M'hm.
They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing. <+++++> Get the Governor on the phone!
He wets the bed? <+++++> I always throw that in. It makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant.
Hey! Weigh! Blow the man down... <+++++> A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
But he'll kill her! <+++++> That means more screen time for us.
Interesting. <+++++> I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
You know, I've been going over our financial condition - if you'll pardon the expression... <+++++> That's quite a change of subject.
It's instinctive, you know. <+++++> He tries to do everything...
That's right, Baxter. <+++++> What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
Better. <+++++> Oh fuck...
Not much time. <+++++> We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright? <+++++> Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that flame thrower ! <+++++> Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here. <+++++> George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot?
Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer. <+++++> HELL NO!!! That's the last thing we need... A buncha cops runnin' around.
What're you talking about? You're not here to see me? <+++++> No, silly. I go here.
Nanook... <+++++> What about Nonook? What have you done to Nanook?! What have you done to my dog, you asshole? !
What are you doing? <+++++> No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
No thanks. Sounds good though. <+++++> Suit yourself.
You think they're strange? <+++++> I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw? The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart? <+++++> Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms. <+++++> Of *course* there's worms, Homer! And what is them worms, really? They just *protein*, them worms! They is *good* for you!
Around somewhere. Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U. What can I do for you? <+++++> You gotta tell me where she is.
Yes. <+++++> Then what the fuck?
You a narc? <+++++> Do I look like a narc?
That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies. <+++++> I'm not going to do it.
What for? <+++++> Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
Buffy? <+++++> Jeffrey!
What are you doing, Wendy? What's in that cup? <+++++> "Wichita"--The guy every boy wants                          ] to be and every girl wants to hold.                         ]
The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up. <+++++> The airport.
Get well soon. <+++++> Every day in every way.
There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did he expect? <+++++> Perhaps he expected to eat it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses. <+++++> Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
Mom! <+++++> The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
Really? <+++++> Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either. I don't guess I'll be seeing you again. Take it easy. <+++++> Same back at you.
This is a complete disaster. I wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one -- <+++++> How am I going to explain this to Walter?
What's the matter? <+++++> Don't you know?
Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness. Under the stars. I've ruined every-- <+++++> I just never thought of you in that...
Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine. <+++++> Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide. <+++++> Jesus, first Mars, now you. You two need anti-depressants.
Boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it'll come up each side. <+++++> It will.
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he? <+++++> Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
Is this what you killed them with? <+++++> You've been listening to rumors.
That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day. <+++++> Mister LaPlante... Bernie... I... just for a few moments... I want to be a human being, not a reporter.
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already. <+++++> Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting. <+++++> You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
I left him a message. <+++++> I know you left him a message. What did you say!
No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you? <+++++> Oh, I studied the guitar. I had to give it up. Gave me calluses on my fingers.
Martha, you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law. <+++++> No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
About goddamn time. <+++++> Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
Save me the sermon. I've heard it all before, it's boring. <+++++> It certainly is...
How small she make you feel. That's why you had the affair in the first place. <+++++> Shut up. Shut your face.
Get down -- where? <+++++> Right here, why not? I prayed in saloons, I prayed in the street, I prayed an the toilet.

What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality. <+++++> It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open.
Tell her what? <+++++> You gotta be hard, Eddie.
My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know... <+++++> Tell us.
God, that's fine. <+++++> Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
Under <u>water</u>? <+++++> High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged. And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
Gotta hex from a voodoo? <+++++> Who do?

Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones. <+++++> Oh. Yeah.
They're re-routing the deflector power conduits... <+++++> Computer -- thermal enhancement.
Are you a good witch, or a bad witch? <+++++> Who, me? Why, I'm not a witch at all. I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun. <+++++> No wonder you're my prize pupil. What about you Thomas J?
Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power -- <+++++> -- Thank you.
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere... <+++++> Neil... Neil Cole.
Objection! <+++++> And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
Michelle. <+++++> Okay. Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be. He comes and he goes. <+++++> The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson. Maybe he knows.
What things? <+++++> She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
Will you come home and forget all about him? <+++++> Yes, if you can get him free.
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg -- <+++++> You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out. <+++++> Tradin' your skins in Castleton?

Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children! <+++++> YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!!

I'm not aware of it. Like what? <+++++> Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.
The porno mags? <+++++> Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him. <+++++> 'Fraid I can't.
Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition. <+++++> What do you mean by that?
Why is she leaving me? <+++++> She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.
I'll be in tomorrow night... Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi... <+++++> Okay. Hold on a second... What is it?
Why? <+++++> Because I'm working the night shift - and I got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there's a lull -

I think he saved my life. <+++++> How so?
We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars. You asked me to find you if you disappeared. So here I am, good-bye. <+++++> What was I doing on Mars?! Damn!
Oh, yeah? Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me -- <+++++> Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb. <+++++> Sick.
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket. <+++++> Oh-what a nice outfit!

Worse, you mean... <+++++> No. Well, maybe a few things. But mostly just different...
[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?] <+++++> Lead the way, Murman.
Uh, Eddie, do you have my money? <+++++> Huh?! Oh yeah, of course.
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. <+++++> His feelings do him honor. And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling...
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard? <+++++> Yeah, hi. Nice house.

I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist. <+++++> I don't have the problems that artists have.
It's not good... <+++++> Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now.
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once. <+++++> You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them.
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del? <+++++> No...
I can't. I just left home. <+++++> You're too young. You should be in school.
Good. <+++++> What if he refuses?
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch. <+++++> Louise?... The maid?... But she should have left earlier today...
What hideous sin have you committed lately? <+++++> I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know <+++++> Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now. <+++++> Who, Benny's little sister?
It's not necessary. <+++++> I know.
No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran? <+++++> What business?
I think so. I mean, we'd have to talk to him. <+++++> Can you set that up?
Uh... yeah. Yeah. <+++++> There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
Right here! <+++++> We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
That could be possible... <+++++> But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
I told you to go, madame. <+++++> Believe me, Leon can't help you. He doesn't know anything about the jewels... I give you my word... I swear it.
I travel every week. College ball, motor sports, training camps... <+++++> The most important thing. Is being together.
Yore old man, Luke, wasn't much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh. <+++++> Yeah, would of been nice to of knowed him, the way you talk about him.
You're not listening to me. <+++++> No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome."
What's the problem? <+++++> Hey, I'm new here, what do you want?
Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl? <+++++> I remember her.
Two words. <+++++> Major. Dish.
'Certainly. And little Johnny?' <+++++> My son's name is Johnny?
Wendy... <+++++> I'm gonna go now.
Perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched. <+++++> But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me.
[And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad.] <+++++> [Correct!]
Not much to tell. Nothing really happened. <+++++> That hasn't stopped you before.
I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else? <+++++> Yeah. Me and my boy here are gonna be in New York overnight.
Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior? <+++++> No.
Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that. <+++++> I don't wanna go mersh, you know that. But hey, if this is about money...
Oh, jackin' off? <+++++> Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
What's inside that nebula cluster? <+++++> Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry. <+++++> Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
She will if you think she should. <+++++> And you think it's best if I don't come.
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me. <+++++> She likes you okay.
Lauren's not my wife. <+++++> Girlfriend?
God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this. <+++++> A girl could get killed - - so they tell me. What's new and hot in Gotham City?
You don't have a clean glass in the house. <+++++> I know.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either. <+++++> Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?
Look, I'm sorry. I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited... <+++++> We're not upset with you, Dave. We think you did a terrific job. Don't we?
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow. <+++++> You mean you and me?
...miles. <+++++> What?
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth! <+++++> That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!
What is it? <+++++> It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
Hi. <+++++> ...which I did not get.
Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer. <+++++> Bullshit.
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot! <+++++> Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
Found? I'm not some charity case. <+++++> I know...
I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me. They were waitin' for me when I got home last night. I ran. <+++++> If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
Why can't you cancel it? <+++++> Once the orders have been given, Plan-R requires any new orders to be received on the CRM-114 in the aircraft.
I met this girl. <+++++> What? Come on. Is it serious?
What, nervous I'm going to win? <+++++> Would you please leave.
You did? <+++++> I know a cheat when I see one. The man was a cheat.
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like - <+++++> We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe! <+++++> The cynicism you refer to, I acquired the day I discovered I was different from little boys!
Uh - will that hold you, Joe? <+++++> Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news. <+++++> You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?" <+++++> Well, I can't talk though --
 <+++++> What?? So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
It's good to see you. <+++++> Likewise.
Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here? <+++++> I killed her. I'm responsible. Oh- h... what can I do now? How can I ever face him?
We should get moving. <+++++> Doc's just in no kinda shape.
What is it? <+++++> Police drone.
I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars. <+++++> If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us. <+++++> Can't make enough swords!
Some of them are. <+++++> How can you tell?
This is Halden. <+++++> Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
We caught 'em. <+++++> Good.
I think you know. <+++++> Maybe you can tell me then.
I haven't got a book down my trousers. <+++++> Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse. I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say?
On this ward? <+++++> Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval! <+++++> About what?
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention. <+++++> Well, that's too bad, this is his day.
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter. <+++++> What?
I'll have that. Glock 22. Nice. <+++++> Where's Faith?
A handfull of nuthin'! You stupid mullet-head. He beat you with nuthin'! Just like today when he kept coming back at me. <+++++> Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean? <+++++> Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads. <+++++> Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded of what I've done.
Yeah. He lives here, right? <+++++> He does.
Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse -- <+++++> ARREST HIM!
They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create. <+++++> So you can't tell me anything?
Blonde. <+++++> Tell me some other things about her.
You what?! How did you do that? <+++++> I'm one of the proofers. I slipped the article in.
He ain't really new. <+++++> He is to a lot of people.
About Charlie's leopard? <+++++> Yes.
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired. <+++++> We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
What is it? <+++++> Nothing.
Hey, it's crazy in here. You're missing a classic party. <+++++> Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
Brilliant. <+++++> Well, it was a big deal. As late as...yesterday. Or this morning. But not anymore.
Is that why the Assembly was convened? <+++++> Yes. He seeks a levy of troops and money.
Mom--I'm not-- <+++++> And you wanted him to make a list!
You visiting? <+++++> Kyra's gone for a couple days. Figured I'd keep Mom company.
No -- no, thanks. <+++++> I'd give you a very good price.
We've been talking about her, mostly. <+++++> Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later. I can't live like this! <+++++> Who is it?
So where would we go? <+++++> Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so. <+++++> You give me more credit than I deserve. Of course, I'm tempted. Who wouldn't be?
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here. <+++++> How are you? Having any luck?
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it? <+++++> Sam, that old woman, whoever she is. I think she told Arbogast something! And I want her to tell us the same thing!
Set one side for Bel Air. <+++++> Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am. <+++++> Whom?
No. <+++++> You don't believe in it.
Jewelry? <+++++> He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
...What? <+++++> I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps. It's real well- written. You should read it -- you're in it. <+++++> I will. I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.
Just a nickname. <+++++> The oracle isn't where the power is anyway. The power's always been with the priests. Even if they had to invent the oracle.
NO-GAH-BUH- NO! Rule number two - NO NAMES! NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard! <+++++> Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty." I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
We do. <+++++> To Oz?
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective. <+++++> The weird thing is I've had an odd, morbid fascination with wolves ever since.
I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't? <+++++> Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
About NOT raping you... <+++++> You DON'T like it, do you?
The other families won't sit still for all out war. <+++++> Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
You <+++++> Have we met?
You haven't switched it on. <+++++> Oh - yes. Look you're putting me off, standing there!
I was six years old! <+++++> I meant later... when you two took naps.
Okay, Jim. I understand. <+++++> Thanks. Well. I'm going home now.
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on... <+++++> What does?
Do you ever get sick of it? <+++++> Of what?
What're you going to do? <+++++> That's tomorrow.
...what's the Long View? <+++++> Your guy gets four more years in Washington...  ...it's only Nine More Days.
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood? <+++++> I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
Yeah. <+++++> Is that all there is to it?
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what? <+++++> To do what you love.
Good. I'd like to book a massage. <+++++> Of course.
Good decision. All actresses are mad as snakes. <+++++> Tony -- what do you think?
...he's the producer of the movie. <+++++> I want you to hear this, pal... Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.
I'm not. <+++++> You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth.
I wanna play a game. <+++++> No...
Thought so. What for? <+++++> For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
Isn't this your vehicle? <+++++> No, no. I just took it.
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this? <+++++> It wasn't my fault. If I would have known, I would have known.
"...of Perpetual Distances." Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop. "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say... <+++++> That's...
I don't think people even noticed. I thought the ceremony was perfect. <+++++> That's thanks to all your help.
I wouldn't really have let you die, you know. I just needed... <+++++> I know.
You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us. <+++++> I understand.
Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands... <+++++> Will you men help us stop the French?
What does that mean? <+++++> Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
That is a <u>nasty</u> story! <+++++> I told you.
Do you want to stay here? <+++++> Do you?
Sir, I was wondering ... <+++++> Sit down, and shut up!
Then why'd you do it? <+++++> I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
Jealous? Of me? <+++++> Not you. Your talent.
You keeping out of trouble? <+++++> I'm trying.
Come in. <+++++> I'd rather talk about Number Two.
What would it take to buy our stock back? Name your price. <+++++> To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid. But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.
Well, then, that means it's call... <+++++> ...waiting!
You look different. I mean you look good. <+++++> You never say that.
Hah! Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen! Found 'em. <+++++> Alive?
What does it say? <+++++> It's gone to the top.
Mr. Roston I know this is difficult for you, but it's important you tell the court what she did. <+++++> She said she was going to fuck me like I've never been fucked before.
I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy? <+++++> I'm so sure! I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana.
You said there were none. <+++++> But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww... <+++++> Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
You're absolutely right. We wouldn't. No sane nation ever would. That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically. <+++++> Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
That shelter was in this bill. <+++++> Alan
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness. <+++++> All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
Too late? That's for me to say. <+++++> Well ... well, I ...
But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to. <+++++> He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
Jesus, look at you   You're glowing. <+++++> I am?
I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it. <+++++> Gordon Liddy, you mean?
What about the blood? <+++++> Could be hers. Types match. Could be a lot of other people's too...
Yes, I know. <+++++> It wouldn't be fair to her.
What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing? <+++++> Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
Not money. But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution. <+++++> We're not proceeding anywhere together.
Get your hands off my daughter! <+++++> Your what?
This story is big huh? <+++++> Mammoth.
We're not there yet, Justin. <+++++> I'm Vince.
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it? <+++++> Very much.
White House boys want a private meeting. <+++++> I'll act surprised.
I'm at work, asshole. Where else? <+++++> Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
Why? <+++++> Why? Because I've seen enough horror movies to know masked weirdos are never friendly.
Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise? <+++++> Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims.
No. <+++++> What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone. <+++++> Is he on his way to Lathrop Wells?
He did a great thing for Tijuana. He did a great thing for Mexico. <+++++> I want to believe you. I really do.
Three minutes, 51 seconds. <+++++> Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies-- <+++++> Thaaaat's right, Dude. The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
That's not going to help. <+++++> I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
Yah. <+++++> 2:30.
Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops. <+++++> Uh-huh. Jad?
Close the door, Raymond. <+++++> Yes, sir.
That's what you theenk. <+++++> Question, sir? His untiring pen predicted the airplane, the submarine, the bicycle, the helicopter, and even the tank.
Most interesting. <+++++> It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
..we only promote safe rubbered sex. <+++++> ..it's really about family and tradition...
It's a long story, this one. <+++++> The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
No, he called late last night. <+++++> I, uh, I'm very surprised.
Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldn't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you, Skippy. <+++++> Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that? <+++++> I need to go now.
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English! <+++++> You're a great teacher, Lloyd.
There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged. <+++++> So what?
Yes. <+++++> Do they know he tell you things?
Life would go on, and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience. <+++++> Uh, Jim?
If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own. <+++++> I'll leave in the morning with Gabriel.
wrestle!" you try and pin me, and I try and pin you. That's the whole game. Got it? <+++++> ...Yeah, okay.
Dr. Hirsch? I'd rather not be by myself. <+++++> Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
Boss loader! <+++++> Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger.
He's in it with Willis? <+++++> I guess so.
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise. <+++++> I'm your daughter all the time, you know. Not just when it's convenient.
Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good? <+++++> Yes. We need a very good gardener.
Hey, hey, you start touching me there, I'm gonna start movin'! Word up, mother... <+++++> Shut up!
You're on vacation, remember? You're supposed to be relaxing. <+++++> I am relaxing.
Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there! <+++++> Come on...
Oh, yes. Thank you. <+++++> There's one more thing, Austin.
Who you calling a "boy"? <+++++> See ya at the yard, Meat.
Telling stories. <+++++> Nope.
That where Anderson worked? <+++++> Yes it is. Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there. I don't know how these fellas do it.
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over. <+++++> Wait 'til you get into trouble, just wait.
...then we saw this. <+++++> Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted. <+++++> When'd you do it?
...aconite get it dat cheap. <+++++> I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky? <+++++> You told him you liked him.
No I don't have it. <+++++> No. You don't.
You never loved me, Hauser! You just used me to get inside. <+++++> Inside what?
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming. <+++++> What do you mean?
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place. <+++++> And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
Yeah, we're down. <+++++> What do you see?
Assure him that there will be no reprisals. Tell him that I know Roth misled him. <+++++> My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping. Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.
For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag? <+++++> Open it.
And she was  a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'. <+++++> People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
Alright, well, alright:  geopolitically... <+++++> We've just found out They Have the Bomb.
You would have looked better. <+++++> Wanna go for a swim?
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven? <+++++> No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
Alan Stanwyk. <+++++> Charmed.
They know. <+++++> They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
Did you see the icky black color of her hair? <+++++> So?
How about the cop? <+++++> Dennis? I want you to release those people.
My turn. <+++++> No.
I've tried to change her mind. <+++++> It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
Has it been exposed to any sun before now? <+++++> I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
Hildy, I thought you were gone -- <+++++> Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.
I want to live. <+++++> I understand.
Migrants? <+++++> Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons.
Want to keep your job, boy? <+++++> What d'you think?
You can't come in here. <+++++> What dya mean?
I'll be back after I make this delivery. <+++++> On the rebound.
Why? <+++++> The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
Please. <+++++> You live with him.
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof. <+++++> But it's so much easier when we make it up.
Is Kay coming? <+++++> No.
Charlie, it's just no go. We can't agree anymore. I wish you'd let me go to Chicago. <+++++> Why, Brad?
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle... <+++++> Yeah?
No. That's what I used to tell myself. <+++++> And what do you tell yourself now?
Richie? You okay? <+++++> I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, "Help us!"
You made those tapes... <+++++> They were performance pieces.
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear. <+++++> A lot of people don't wear underwear.
Holy Christ. You want to get us killed? <+++++> Don't be silly. I'll just tell Lester we were smoking a couple of joints. See?
How're the cameras doing? <+++++> Due for a re-load and battery check. I'll get on it.
Was he difficult? <+++++> No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
Drop it. <+++++> Take him!
I'm sorry sir, we need your debit card before we can issue a credit -- <+++++> -- Katie.
The room! <+++++> Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that! <+++++> Give me a date, Doctor.
You heard me! <+++++> I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
Because I felt like it. What do you care? <+++++> I couldn't do it.
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK. <+++++> You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
I don't think that's funny! <+++++> Of course it's funny - this is all too laughable to be anything else.
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself. <+++++> She was beautiful. Perfect to me -				*
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial? <+++++> When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
Eww. No. That's gross. <+++++> It's not gross. How else do you think girls learn? Here turn around and face me.
I'm not laughing, Steven. <+++++> You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart. And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
I'm on a diet. But thank you. <+++++> You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
What did he want? <+++++> Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.
What happened, Joey...? <+++++> I can't talk now.
New Mecca.... <+++++> Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
Were <i>you</i> alone? <+++++> Yes.
How what, Wendell? <+++++> How'd you get them to retract?
...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now. <+++++> What?
In the bag underneath. <+++++> What if he checks it?
But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face? <+++++> I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
What? <+++++> Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine.
Radar Stealth Mode checks out. All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge. I'm taking her down. <+++++> Into the Hudson?
It's for you. <+++++> For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
It's a mine, isn't it? <+++++> Just relax.
What's crackin'? <+++++> You. Hi, Uncle Willie.
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here? <+++++> Listen to me....
The key to my hotel room! I want you to have my baseball cards! And please be sure to pay my bill! <+++++> Young man, stop right there!
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite? Am I a New England school-marm? <+++++> Yes.
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one. <+++++> So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.
Jesus Christ you're right. <+++++> You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this? <+++++> What choice do we have?
Out. <+++++> Come on.
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice. <+++++> Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now. <+++++> But you must have something to go on?
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you. <+++++> For the moment, Mr. Grady. Only for the moment.
How's it look, Marge? <+++++> Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame.
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid. <+++++> No, I don't admit it's stupid.
Till it's in a powder. The energy exits within you... <+++++> I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self. But what's this got to do with it?
Uh-uh. <+++++> Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L.
All right. I'll have to look for it. <+++++> Mr. Lombardo. We're running kind of late. How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?
He's dead. <+++++> Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
Hey, what's the rush? C'mon, walk me a couple of blocks. <+++++> Jim, I've got to go. I'm already late--
I hardly recognize you with a beard. <+++++> That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about? <+++++> Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
What? <+++++> Reptilian swine. There's no such thing. Reptiles aren't swine.
Now? <+++++> Yes!
Well... sure... <+++++> Then maybe you can tell me why George would be going into the ladies room.
Those fuckin' niggers. This time I'm going to eat balls!... You ever try 'em? <+++++> Naw.
Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight. <+++++> The staff donÂt know yet... I called my parents, told them everything... I just couldnÂt take any more...
What a chase! <+++++> No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back.
I'm just makin' a point, you stupid sonofabitch! <+++++> Okay, Pappy.
I'm just worried about your health, Larry. You could stand to shed a few pounds. <+++++> And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
You think I should quit? ! <+++++> I didn't say that. That's up to you. But I have responsibility for the other guys up there, not just you.
No ID in her room? <+++++> Not hardly nothin' in her room. And that establishment was no stickler on registration. Well...
That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that? ! <+++++> That's not how he tells it.
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever. <+++++> You are more beautiful than any of them.
What I been wondering is where's he been. <+++++> Yeah, where've you been? We haven't heard from you lately.
I can do it! <+++++> The code name of your contact will be Boris. Your code name will be--
Do any other daikinis ever come by here? <+++++> Why.
Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious? <+++++> Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
You did okay, back there. I was fairly impressed. <+++++> Not good enough. We still gotta catch Big Geek.
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot. <+++++> Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
But I thought -- <+++++> We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road. <+++++> I haven't seen anybody doing that.
I don't understand. <+++++> You will after tonight. Bet on it.
What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing. <+++++> I'll stop him... You stall him.
I don't even know your name yet ... <+++++> My name is Kader, Ali ... Saari Kader ... In other words, in order to join the organization, you had to undergo a test.
Come on, let's go. <+++++> Where?
Sorry, it's just that... <+++++> I understand.
I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you. <+++++> Really? Thanks.
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something. <+++++> I'm not that sick.
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery. <+++++> All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
So really, it's good luck. <+++++> Good luck?
You are being rude again. <+++++> I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
You think these are tits don't you? <+++++> Ah.
I bet you'd like to touch them? <+++++> Oh.
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy. They shot him down. <+++++> Oh no! No! I can't believe it. I can't believe it. Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
I haven't worn mine in months. <+++++> Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it. The Suit.
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't -- <+++++> From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better.
What did you say to me? <+++++> It's a little late for you to be up.
 <+++++> We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that? !
To win? <+++++> What else?
So you're our own private guy? <+++++> I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
Like silk? <+++++> God. That does sound corny. Oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. But it really kind of does.
Unhappy combination. Most likely one's inside the other. <+++++> Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton. Not man-eaters --
We~re oetting hammered, Jason. Return fIre? <+++++> No. Keep all energy to the armor.
What's the crazy man saying, Lord? <+++++> The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
I thought I might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle. <+++++> Do you like red?
You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim. <+++++> I don't want to learn that!
I want a name. A real name. This thing's full name, rank and serial number. <+++++> Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
We'll be there. <+++++> Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow. It's really good to meet you.
I think he's dead. <+++++> No shit. Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head...
And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me. <+++++> I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
Yeah. <+++++> You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you. <+++++> It's not me he's in trouble with.
I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something. <+++++> Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us.
What's going on? <+++++> She wants to make a deal.
He says they remind him who he his. They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey. <+++++> Mickey?
Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake. I use girls who look like movie stars. Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon. <+++++> That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
Bainbridge Books. <+++++> Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard. I called you earlier about a book.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine. He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden. <+++++> Is that a good sign, Doctor?
How could you be a part of this? <+++++> These are my people now. I'm one of them.
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it? <+++++> Yes.
Wait a minute - my bracelet. What happened to my bracelet? <+++++> What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
Jesus Christ! And you never told me? <+++++> This is my way of telling you --
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said... <+++++> She told me.
Five, seven, and nine-- <+++++> Yes! Now don't worry!
Can I ask how old you are? <+++++> I'm twelve.
Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source. <+++++> Nobody else had it.
You should. <+++++> You're right.
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night... <+++++> Not very precise directions.
No, really. <+++++> You mean like career? Uh, I don't know.
I swear to you that's all that happened. I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom. <+++++> A lot that means.
You will go to palace there. <+++++> Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores? Wow. <+++++> Good luck.
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now. <+++++> Why do you say that? Is there something wrong?
Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious. <+++++> Seen a doctor?
We've got to get out of here. <+++++> That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?
I loved you much, as King, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky. <+++++> Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory.
Not that he cares but the wife and kid might. <+++++> Theo's dead.
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me. <+++++> I don't think anything in the world could make me say that.
Dad? <+++++> Yes?
It would mean nothing less than victory for England. <+++++> My dear Caulaincourt, you have no idea of how compromised my own position has become since Tilsit.
North Island, please repeat? Over. <+++++> Arctic Warrior, passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea day two month two year one nine five three. Over.
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently. <+++++> In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.
Hasta siempre. <+++++> Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland?
No? Why's that? <+++++> "Occupational hazard".
No. <+++++> But you put yourself on the circuit!
Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself. <+++++> Saved all our lives, Doc. None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms, Doc. God's honest truth.
Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world. <+++++> If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train. <+++++> Have you ever been to that station?
Sean -- <+++++> No. That's what everyone thinks. John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before.
Liar. <+++++> 0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.
I did like the music. <+++++> I carried you up to your bed.
Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard! <+++++> And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates.
Hey, I know, it's hard. But do what I do. <+++++> What you do?
He must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his. It's like a bed on wheels. It must smell of semen... <+++++> It does.
Why couldn't he talk about that here? <+++++> He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal. What's wrong with him?
Absolutely. <+++++> That's ridiculous.
Rules are made to be broken. <+++++> People, too.
Tell him to put his gun down! <+++++> Let her go! Let her go! !
No, I didn't know that. <+++++> Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
So who was he with? <+++++> He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner and Â  - you.
You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through? <+++++> It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo.
You damn well thought wrong. <+++++> I'm terribly sorry old man.
I can't seem to let go of you... <+++++> You hear me complaining about that?
He was adopted you know. <+++++> I'd forgotten.
How do you think that made him feel? What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" <+++++> I told that woman I'm an orphan.
You will keep in touch. <+++++> Of course. Every day.
What are you? <+++++> I'm the librarian. I've always been the librarian.
For what? An abortion? <+++++> Oh, don't be ridiculous.
You've heard this story before? <+++++> So many times, I'm starting to think it happened to me.
What is this place? <+++++> Looks like a diner.
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag. <+++++> This knife is filthy.
I'm working on a few things. <+++++> Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
This used to be the main highway. Want to register, please? <+++++> Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
No, Edgar Allen. <+++++> The furniture guy?
What are we going to do about this? <+++++> I'll handle it.
...deal with this asshole. <+++++> Even though it is nice to see Andy...
Eddie?... YOU OWE ME MONEY! <+++++> And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
They found another note? <+++++> Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom.
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I? <+++++> I want to know why .
What happened to Dick Wilson? <+++++> Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh!
You never learn, do you, Gittes? <+++++> I guess not.
What made it... <+++++> It deliberately came down at you -- you're bleeding...
Stop it. He's a nice guy. <+++++> If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
Not a chance. <+++++> Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.
I'll have to re-energize. <+++++> Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems...  Mr. Sulu, impulse climb.
See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck? <+++++> -- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.
Alonzo? What are you talking about? Where are you...? <+++++> They had me from the gate.
Kiss the back of my knees. <+++++> Through the sweats or not?
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512. <+++++> Thank you.
Not true. <+++++> Have you ever kissed anyone?
His reactor's starting to overheat. <+++++> Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant.
Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable. <+++++> No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that.
Baker. <+++++> What's our friend's problem?
Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing. <+++++> Clearly.
Oh, baby, you're the bestest. <+++++> Oh, go on.
Donut said something about a news van. <+++++> Yeah, we have a van.
I said you bastard -- stop -- <+++++> Got to catch me first --
 <+++++> ... My ... social situation?
Turn the tapes back on. <+++++> Fine.
Wait! I need those! <+++++> There is no softer ground than town.
And you are? <+++++> Smith. I am Agent Smith.
Say, you can't do thatÂ <+++++> I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors.
[Beat] How do you know? <+++++> The Jacket.
Christ if I shouldn't know better than to step in soft earth. I've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old. <+++++> I got it from here. Thanks.
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win? <+++++> Yes.
What would you say, too fast...too quick... <+++++> And far too aggressive.
What are you saying? <+++++> Let's hear him. What have we got to lose? What's your name?
Most natural thing in the world! <+++++> I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee!
 <+++++> That's a shame. I'll send the key right down.
Where's those glossy prints you promised? Tonight's the latest I can place them - <+++++> Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it. It's cold out here, Susie.
What if they're dangerous? <+++++> They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
Whoever they are, they're getting closer. <+++++> I'll go...
And you've been extremely patient. <+++++> You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important. <+++++> I know.
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all... <+++++> Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years. What a marvelous program. Innovative. Inspiring. You are to be commended. <+++++> Well... thank you.
When does he graduate high school? <+++++> Oh, very jealous.
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here. <+++++> Not that. Look at what I wrote down cause I can't say it.
You mean like, movie trilogies? <+++++> You seem to like movies, Detective.
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick? <+++++> Yes.
Gary Blinker's fulla shit! <+++++> He's not!
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter? <+++++> You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love.
I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..? <+++++> Well somone's got to suffer for this Doctor. You've got to be merciful and quick. Excuse me.
You let us worry about that. <+++++> Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
Jake -- <+++++> What?
In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them. <+++++> There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
Where's Sartorius? <+++++> In his lab. He won't let you in.
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this. <+++++> My poverty, but not my will consents.
I took these out of Data's neural net... they contain memory engrams... <+++++> Do you know how they were damaged?
Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him. <+++++> But Keaton...
Are you sleeping? <+++++> No.
What does Clifford say? <+++++> Right now we have to be practical.
You're an hour and a half late. <+++++> My watch is broken, too.
Fine, thank you. Here, please take these. <+++++> What are they?
Run into Josh? <+++++> Yeah, but it was okay.
Will you work for me? <+++++> Of course... But how?
Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar. <+++++> A third. I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
But you don't mind. <+++++> No, I don't mind.
Yeah, I'm sure it's famed for lotsa things, and you're one'a'them... <+++++> ...but:  this particular statue...
May I say something, Mr. President? <+++++> There's no secrets here, Al.
Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott. <+++++> Sir...?
A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes. <+++++> No you can't.
You can't do that. <+++++> The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ? <+++++> He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough. * <+++++> Now I can't breathe.
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE! <+++++> THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
Do you think he'd be satisfied with the two hundred dollars? I think he would. <+++++> That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won't take a dime less than three hundred dollars.
...done right, you gotta do it yourself. <+++++> Then do it the way you want.
Nell, it makes sense. It all makes sense. You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up. <+++++> -- but the painting!
From the sun. It's a reflection on the glass. <+++++> It's her! I'm telling you. She whispered and turned on the music. She's trying to contact me!
I just got it fixed. <+++++> You're on.
So. <+++++> We were gonna ... You know ...
How could it not, Excellency? <+++++> Yes?
It's a question. <+++++> She got the child labor stuff from me.
Yeah. <+++++> Who's got the car keys?
Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for. <+++++> That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think... <+++++> They'll start to soon enough.
You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood. <+++++> I... I was just leaving.
Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle. <+++++> Shut up.
How's everything? <+++++> 
Louise? <+++++> Go, Chief.
Okay, Sugar - all clear. You better go back to bed. <+++++> I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
My problem is I come here to drink in peace. So if you don't mind... <+++++> C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?
Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars. I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect... <+++++> All the adulation? It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,- <+++++> Could you see her?
Sexy, hm? What was I before? <+++++> Older, sillier.
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been. <+++++> Ha! Where's that?
Always. <+++++> We go out, smash 'em now?
You killed him you fucking faggot -- <+++++> We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
So, that's Ryan. <+++++> Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
Do be a dear and tell me all about it. Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life. <+++++> Extra ordinary, yes. But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
...Like you? <+++++> Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
So, tell me about your day, Donald. <+++++> I met a girl.
C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon. <+++++> They'll kill me.
That's the general idea. Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned. <+++++> You are talking crazy!
Then why did she object to you? <+++++> Because she was afraid.
So, I hear you're from New Mexico! <+++++> Sometimes.
'Feeling'? I feel fine. How do you feel? <+++++> Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy. This is the left- field thing of all time. What do I do?
How'd it go? <+++++> Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
Why are you doing this to me, Jack? <+++++> This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
Keep your change. Bus three-twenty-three. Leaves at seven fifty two, tonight. <+++++> I'm sorry. It's just ... you know ...
You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal! <+++++> Oh my God, sir!
The new world. <+++++> It's not real.
The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question? <+++++> Where have I been?
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties. <+++++> Really?
Oh, that. <+++++> by order of the Master of the Revels!
And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are. <+++++> Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
You pack a gun? <+++++> Not really.
This is so embarrassing... <+++++> Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that? And a spotlight. What's your name?
Yeah. Right. <+++++> Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
Where's Vince? <+++++> There's Albert! Hey, Albert!! !
So, what's the news? <+++++> The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
Hit the brakes! <+++++> They're jammed!
A little ...  Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley... <+++++> What's wrong with that area?
What do you want? <+++++> Not money. But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
She's a he. His name is Swifty. <+++++> My lead bird. He's always on that top perch.
But what about you and the baby? You need me. <+++++> Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
I have to leave. Tonight. <+++++> Why?
In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her. <+++++> I had a notion you had become selfÂappointed chaperone lately Â why?
She thinks I can bring Edward back. <+++++> Someday you can. We all believe that...
I started to get serious about seven years ago. <+++++> What was the bottle that did it?
Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far. <+++++> Kid--kid--
Of course. I'll get a car to drive you. <+++++> No, that's... That's OK. We don't need any help. We'll be just fine. Won't we, Lynn?
He makes films for Mr. Eddy. <+++++> Pornos.
All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president. <+++++> So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?
Yes. You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies. <+++++> But somebody wrote those songs.
So, you're just kind of a roving -- <+++++> -- General handyman, yeah. I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.
Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago. <+++++> Were you involved in the incident where that guy killed himself in his office ? I am sorry.
He's the opposite of you. He's more like me. Cold, calculating. <+++++> How'd you get to know so much about him?
Would he know? <+++++> He knows. A lot.
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up! <+++++> An hour?
The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is. <+++++> I don't know if --
Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- scratch that; I'll fire him. ...Make it fast, make it fast. <+++++> You --
Who? <+++++> Henry Lucas.
That's not bad. <+++++> That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
-- it hasn't been two years -- <+++++> -- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway! You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse?
At least I'll have company when I die. Ain't that right, Jake? <+++++> For Christ's sake, John! Throw me the keys!
Quick! <+++++> Why?
Reed?... Sue? <+++++> They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
I can't. I'm seeing a friend. <+++++> Who?
The Black Pearl is a real ship. <+++++> No, it's not.
Why wouldn't they? Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds -- <+++++> That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues. Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
Imagine--she was alive. What a horror. Could have been buried alive. She must have run away from the morgue. <+++++> Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
I was desperate. It was gross. <+++++> Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
Listen-- <+++++> Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ... <+++++> You'd drifted right through the core systems. It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink. <+++++> You haven't got any money.
Sexogerarian, eh? Yes. Yes. But I can't put that in the paper. <+++++> Why not?
She's innocent. <+++++> Aren't they all?
Alone again. What are you up to today? <+++++> I'm doing some volunteer work.
Where's the ice cream? The HÃ¤agen- Dazs butter pecan? <+++++> Shit! I forgot.
What if I was a relative? <+++++> You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care.
Stay right. Left is trouble. <+++++> I though we went over this.
I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars. My father was a Jedi! Were you in many battles? <+++++> Several, I think. There is not much to tell.
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question -- <+++++> Go ahead and waste your time.
I thought maybe you'd like to be here when she wakes up. <+++++> That's impossible. You'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact, I'm counting on you --
Fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers. How long can a battle go on? <+++++> You got to relax, Henry. Since the deluge started, you been working in the OR and running the outfit, too.
It's not a habit. I do it because I like it. <+++++> I was referring to myself. I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you? <+++++> I'm not sailing his boat.
I don't know. This makes me feel funny. <+++++> Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
That's a good story. <+++++> So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there? Brother said it was worth it.
There is one thing left to do... Excalibur... And you must do it, Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command you. <+++++> I cannot--
No I'm not. <+++++> I'll do it.
Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss. I didn't do anything wrong. I fought in the war, for crissakes! <+++++> Fought? Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
Go to the movies. <+++++> All right.
Oh! You scared me. <+++++> Me? No. What are you doing here?
Did I miss something? <+++++> I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right? <+++++> So?
Get your things together, you have to leave! <+++++> What's happened?
Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you? <+++++> How...how do you know?
Uh, or, uh-let's see now... maybe I should, uh, take "Introduction to the Novel." <+++++> Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.
This horse is booked. <+++++> Tell the guy, get me the horse, I'll give him an Associate Producer credit.
I wouldn't do it. <+++++> You would not...?
Commander, Klingon vessel. Stand by to board this ship on my next signal. <+++++> No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her. She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal-- <+++++> That can't be right. That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me? <+++++> Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on?
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine. <+++++> Summer colds are the worst.
She's not here. <+++++> You know where I can find her?
He's lying. <+++++> Look at him. You think he played it square? How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
What about him? <+++++> He could live with us.
That guy rules! <+++++> Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
Yeah. I really admire the guy. Well. Good to meet you. <+++++> Yeah. Cheers, mate.
Jesus Christ! <+++++> Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different...
I am going to be killed. I have seen the Devil and looked him in the eye.&gt;&gt; <+++++> No good. He needs guarantees. He says... his life is in danger... He has seen the Devil... looked him in the eye.
Funded by whom? <+++++> John Hammond.
Maternity ward, huhh! <+++++> We'll never make it through that mainway...I wonder what happened to SEN. I'm crazy!
Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch. Just like taking a picture. <+++++> The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department. <+++++> Thank you.
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo. <+++++> That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
Why shouldn't I? <+++++> How many people in the bus?
A little. <+++++> Bullshit a little. You lied to me.
I fought for you... and I still fight for you. <+++++> You fought for me...?! ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building.
I understand. You're upset. You want to know what's going on. That's good. <+++++> Why are you talking like that?
Jade Fox? Impossible. <+++++> You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
What a weirdo that guy is! Paranoid. What's the matter with you? <+++++> Look I-I-I'll be okay. I'll be okay.
The woman you shot. She was my friend. <+++++> That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
Kind of isolated. <+++++> Yeah. It's kind of nice.
How about Lankaster Merrin. <+++++> Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot. <+++++> I didn't mean that.
We can't just go off and-- <+++++> There's nothing we can do. We shouldn't even be here in the first place.
If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I -- <+++++> Forget I asked. It was a mistake.
There's no child here. <+++++> But ... the dogs...
So how can we get to it? <+++++> The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...
-Auditorium nostrum- <+++++> Stop.
Gale, your engine's still running. <+++++> Fuck!
Chip, your ride is here. <+++++> Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey.
And what do you do, Lucy? <+++++> I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
I don't even really know. I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while. <+++++> Of course you can have it if you need it. Can I get you something to eat?
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own. <+++++> I've always taken care of you.
What are doing, Bond? Trying to impress this innocent thing? <+++++> SheÂs no innocent. This is my nuclear consultant.
And winter? <+++++> Well, winter's far behind us now.
Yes. But not as a date date. <+++++> Why not?
--And he has sex appeal. <+++++> So what?
You don't like the way I live -- you don't like my friends, or my new house -- or anything. <+++++> But Jabez, I never said that!
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother. <+++++> She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
How is he? <+++++> He'll live. But it means your boy's behind it. Astricky was holding a list. They just faxed it to us...
What happened? Is it over? <+++++> I'm taking you home. You're not well.
Emily, you - <+++++> Brad, I'm -  I'm not an old woman yet -
Stick your cock up her ass! You mother fucking, worthless cocksucker! <+++++> Be silent!
The right nostril. Good. <+++++> My right nostril?
That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick. For my book. Funny how the subconscious works. Hazel is my friend. <+++++> She wiped out her whole family.
You don't take another man's place, boy. <+++++> It wasn't his fault. Nobody said anything about seats. We --
Maybe. <+++++> You're out of line, mister.
Jonas builds assassins for a living. Several of whom may be in place already. We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone. <+++++> Where do you think Jerry is?
Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar? <+++++> You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker, didn't you?
You're leaving tomorrow? <+++++> In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
Ow! My foot's asleep! <+++++> Come on - let's go!
Fire insurance! <+++++> Yes, there's our way out. A fire in this place would give us ten thousand pounds.
Gordon Cole? <+++++> And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
How are we going to find her? There must be thousands of white vans in this state. <+++++> Hey, I'm a police officer, remember?
Even now! I'm crying and I can't stop and they won't go away. And now it's going to be another month! <+++++> Shari...
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession? <+++++> Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy.
Cigarettes. Camel Lights. <+++++> mmm.hmm.
I'm only asking what you think. <+++++> I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies. <+++++> I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. They've got you down as a sap. <+++++> I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
No, I mean, no big whoop. <+++++> I can't do this.
OK, Gordon. <+++++> OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
You haven't got the authority. Only Pendergast can pull the plug. <+++++> Pendergast may be in trouble. Don't you understand? He still hasn't come back. It's been over three hours --
D'Amour -- <+++++> Shit...
They owe us, man. That's the least they can do. <+++++> This money is evidence.
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid. <+++++> Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer.
I don't trust you! <+++++> Scanlon out!
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez. <+++++> Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
That's who you are too, Emma. <+++++> Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers. Now I... remember.
Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you. <+++++> Just take it, OK.
You sure? <+++++> Positive.
Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"? <+++++> 
He's waitin' for you in the card room. <+++++> Let him wait.
This man wearing the jacket identified himself as an Federal agent? <+++++> Uh, yeah.
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night. <+++++> Last night? I was at home.
Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls. <+++++> No!
Kelly. What is it? <+++++> I miss Dad.
How're you doing? <+++++> Fine. Just fine.
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions. Drunk driving. Lost his licence. That's why he don't work no more. <+++++> Can't get off that shitty dump they live on. What little money comes in goes to booze.
He said he traveled for two months. <+++++> I took a different route.
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you. <+++++> I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something.
And now Jonathan Masbath. <+++++> Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities? <+++++> The worst serial killer in history - who? Gacy - right? Killed forty two people.
I need to know what you know about this guy. <+++++> Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
Tell Ashley... I... <+++++> YOU TELL HER!
As which point she drops to her knees in pain... <+++++> Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
Too late. I've tried. I think you're right, Jake. I'm game. <+++++> Me, too.
Is this the protective male talk? <+++++> This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.
The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan. <+++++> Okay.
Sal? What's that for? Salvatore? <+++++> Sal. He's the killer. We're Vietnam veterans so killing don't mean anything to us, you understand?
I just didn't feel right about it. <+++++> You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
You want some? <+++++> No, thanks.
When you get the Grail, I'm sure I'll be seeing lots of you on various talk shows... <+++++> But I can't get it... He's...
Fifteen kilos. Seven and a half in each suitcase. You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery. <+++++> Okay.
He got hit by a bus. <+++++> No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died.
What are you doing? <+++++> I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
By my head here come the Capulets. <+++++> By my heel, I care not.
As long as you keep remembering why. <+++++> Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
Keep it to yourself. <+++++> 
How long have you been married? <+++++> Nine...nine, yes? Nine years, just about.
If we find Buffalo Bill through your information, I'll suppress it. Nobody has to know this hospital cooperated. <+++++> I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will out... And then what?
If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about. <+++++> Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
You'll get awful mad, John. I done a Sin! <+++++> You what?
You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home. It's almost like... <+++++> Magic.
No thanks, Swana. <+++++> Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
Which is guy-speak for... <+++++> Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth. But I'm trying to be honest, okay? Three years is a long time.
Don't you think it's a little too... bright? <+++++> Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
Got a reason to stay. <+++++> That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
It's no meteor, that's for sure! <+++++> Darnedest thing I ever saw - the way that's unscrewing!
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown... <+++++> Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was...
Cash. <+++++> How much do I owe you?
They've never been separated before. <+++++> What does he want with a precog?
What the hell's going on? <+++++> Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair. <+++++> I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
I can't fucking believe you! ! <+++++> I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing. <+++++> Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway.
Two. <+++++> Two miles.
Ben Gay. <+++++> That was Thursday.
You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on? <+++++> Yes. Amazing isn't it?
Will she be angry? <+++++> She made me promise not to.
Well, that's ridiculous. If the teleprinter and radio links are out of order, just pick up a phone and pay for a call. <+++++> I know it sounds crazy, sir, but we tried, and nobody answers any of the telephones.
You ever play one of these? <+++++> I've seen 'em.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. <+++++> Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out.
To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout. Play lots of contact sports? <+++++> I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
He had a few birds. I got up and fed 'em this morning. <+++++> That was nice of you.
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical. <+++++> Skeptical...?
Zira doesn't want your female. <+++++> I want her.
Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy. <+++++> What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have.
Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize. <+++++> What did you find, Dad?
Am I disturbing you? <+++++> I'm really all right, Barnett. Don't you worry really... I just don't want you to leave me that's all.
See you later, alligator. <+++++> 'kay.
That's what he did to me. He put cigarettes out on me. <+++++> Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Be quiet. <+++++> We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
Good morning, Louise. <+++++> He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett. He's a friend of mine. This is Sheriff Cobb. <+++++> Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.
Then what is it? Is there somebody else? <+++++> No...
Could you? <+++++> Where to?
There's a hole! I found a square hole! <+++++> That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon. <+++++> Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger? <+++++> Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
That's really funny. <+++++> I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life. <+++++> Alright.
Or, God forbid, Capraesque. I suppose AMERICAN will do for now but-- <+++++> CITIZEN KANE
They never do, Mr. Barker. <+++++> Baker.
That's what makes you interesting. As a teacher. <+++++> God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher.
Hello. You want some information? <+++++> Yeah.
Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em. Called it a lease. They make payments every June and December... <+++++> Why? If they could never take title.
Over. <+++++> We found one.
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure? ! <+++++> Yeah I'm sure! I did it with my own hands!
I don't know all the details. <+++++> Matter of fact...
I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy... <+++++> Who's your Daddy!
What? She asked. <+++++> It's called tact, you fuckrag.
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away. <+++++> Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --
It was such a long time ago. <+++++> Still--
So, you gotta boyfriend? <+++++> Why? You wanna ask me out?
I should have - <+++++> I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up.
You're just reading me. <+++++> No. No! It ain't you. They're inside. Inside the perimeter. They're in here.
Ready? <+++++> What time is it?
My name is Trinity. <+++++> Trinity? The Trinity? The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us? <+++++> That's what we're here to find out.
Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him? <+++++> I didn't say anything-
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. <+++++> Don't touch anything.
I'll deal with you later. <+++++> Right, good. Tell you what, we'll wait right here. Till you get back.
No -- they don't. <+++++> Well -- when did you decide all this?
It was the PLO. <+++++> Whatever.
That won't happen again. We're different. <+++++> How can I tell? You've seen both of me. I only know what you're like here. You're all I know.
So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed? <+++++> He's a Toon... who cares?
Where the HELL did he go? <+++++> Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one.
What are you doing? <+++++> Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
There's one called....Window... something with a window. <+++++> Dark Windows. How did you like it?
How's work going? Are you back at school? <+++++> I start on Monday.
Benjamin? <+++++> What?
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by. <+++++> How old is he?
It is also a place of burial. <+++++> A tomb? We're in a tomb?
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte. <+++++> Yes, Maxine, yes.
He's his own boss, and very competent. <+++++> And with prison record.
You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain. <+++++> I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
What's wonderful about the air, James? <+++++> It's so clean. No germs.
Let me run my family without you on my back. I want them taken care of. <+++++> No. There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth. I don't want them disturbed.
No bother. <+++++> I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
Don't be shitty. <+++++> How am I being shitty?
Her show? <+++++> "A Reason to Love."
Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you. I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you. <+++++> Heidi, I'm dying.
Next. Could I see your documents, please? <+++++> Yes sir.
But that's not the point... <+++++> That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet. <+++++> Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
Your toes cold? <+++++> Yeah.
Crane. <+++++> That's it.
What are you doing? ! <+++++> Knox? !
Call them every five miles. <+++++> Thirty-five, still straight.
Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else. <+++++> Or else what?
Really? <+++++> Yeah!
She hates me, Louis. <+++++> You should go back to her.
You have the money? <+++++> Tomorrow.
Hardly the case, Senator. <+++++> Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type.
Everything was different. <+++++> But in what ways?
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war... <+++++> We weren't real thrilled about it either...
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood. <+++++> Fine. I'll say no.
It's time you got some ambition. <+++++> I always figured I'd live longer without it.
You can't be late though. <+++++> I know.
That's under lock and key. <+++++> Me too.
...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred... <+++++> I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it? <+++++> Reach for the limit I always say.
... Does this do anything? <+++++> Depends what number you write.
Please, sit. <+++++> Thanks.
Stop, we're embarrassing h... <+++++> ... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case... <+++++> What you thought!?
Well. I like a man who gets to the point. <+++++> You're Pam?
Raw? <+++++> Uh-huh. Want one?
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while. <+++++> That's easy enough.
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain? ! <+++++> I will not defend my life to you--
Tell me once more. <+++++> I don't love you.
Hi! <+++++> Ann. Hello.
I didn't know. <+++++> Yes ÂÂ and I must say I've done very well with it -- perhaps even better than Jacqueline.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right. <+++++> You think Tran killed her?
A box? <+++++> It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
Somebody in a Hospital gown. And we need a ......hello? Hello...? <+++++> Cause I don't think <u>this</u> dog is gonna hunt....
That would give us only three seconds to revive him... <+++++> What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
Really? <+++++> Yes! It was...it was unforgettable.
Just tell me what it is, I'll say it. I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me. <+++++> Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.
You can light the lamp. I'm sure glad it's you. We were afraid those killers might come back. <+++++> Three men on matched roans?
I know you. How come you're so tense today? <+++++> What can I tell you?
Because it's cheap like a budgie. <+++++> And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; a bit anti-social, you know.
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking. <+++++> Well, let's rock and roll.
Who's this? <+++++> Dennis Leary.
I'm bored, and so are the kids. <+++++> Just a few more minutes, then we can go. Take her, will you?
You don't care if they stop or not. 'Cause you got some money in your pocket, see? <+++++> Clever.
You need to consider a few issues. <+++++> ...you'd be operating outside territorial United States. Your badges do not count. You have no authorization to carry weapons.
What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome? <+++++> That's good, isn't it?
It's me, Robert Dean. From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on-- <+++++> Bobby--
It's true. It's true. <+++++> Lois, I . . .
He's a mean one. And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan. <+++++> Hold on, Ray! Half-price! Have you gone crazy?
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case! <+++++> Alright, I gave him the case? .. So the case is closed, so what?
Yo -- <+++++> pierdo.
What? You are crazy! <+++++> Look, just hear me out, okay?
What was that about? <+++++> I know, right?
I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from? <+++++> Watch? --
Right. Seven. Christ, thatÂs a long time, isnÂt it? <+++++> Not for a dog.
Then why do you still like her? <+++++> Like her? I don't know if I ever liked her. It's just you want what you can't get.
Ready to go,go,go? <+++++> Where's Richard and Julia?
Why won't you tell me your name? <+++++> It's only our first date.
No, no, please! <+++++> Teddy, be brave.
Yes. He's already here. <+++++> Father?
If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am. What? I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you. <+++++> That's alright.
Why? <+++++> No reason why...
That's right. <+++++> What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it? <+++++> I flat don't like the guy, Glory. He's dirty. And I'll tell you something else.
Well? <+++++> I'm with <u>you!</u>
I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn. <+++++> Am I in there?
Anything rated higher than a P.C. 's got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct. <+++++> It hasn't yet.
Sir, I understand. I don't like it, but I understand. <+++++> Good, now get your goddamned gear.
Before we kill her or cure her.. <+++++> Right.
I don't understand. <+++++> Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
A few days ago. <+++++> Does he stay with you here?
What, are you trying to handicap me? <+++++> I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me? I'm serious.
I'm very, very serious. <+++++> But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
We can stay alive a month, maybe more. Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair. <+++++> A month? Will doesn't have a month! We've got to do something to help him!
Colonel! <+++++> You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim. <+++++> It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday. A quiet little chat between gentlemen.
I love gifts. What did you guys get us? <+++++> Nothing that can't be exchanged.
No, before my time. <+++++> You don't read, do you?
Helluva game! <+++++> One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
What I'm saying, they're getting some help. <+++++> So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine.
I got, uh.... <+++++> I got fifty bucks. I'll get more.
I told you not to hang up on me. <+++++> What do you want?
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff. She's one of my most valuable employees. <+++++> Does she know anything about babies?
I'm not interested in the newspapers. <+++++> But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
Who got himself what? <+++++> One of mine. And it wasn't a standard hit.
I suppose they are, sir. <+++++> You're damned right they are.
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em. <+++++> Copy.
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer? <+++++> No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure. <+++++> I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
Move the candle closer, I can't see. <+++++> He wouldn't of took no beating like that if it hadn't of jammed. He wouldn't just give it over an' not shoot no one.
The freak in the gas mask -- <+++++> Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the Reich's top Scientists. Head of the Thule Occult Society.
The fuck was that? <+++++> The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
If you want to call it that. <+++++> Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour! <+++++> I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
But -- <+++++> Have you seen what's happening out there? The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.
Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys? <+++++> There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
No, no. I did. <+++++> That's nice. It's nice. I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies.
No, not always. <+++++> Sometimes I wake up and I can't sleep, not without a drink. The bars don't open until eight.
Am I bothering you? <+++++> No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Madame. <+++++> Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want? <+++++> Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic.
Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me. <+++++> Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me. <+++++> oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly. <+++++> Approaching the first gate.
It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window. <+++++> Now that it's out of your system.
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you. <+++++> Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
Excuse me? <+++++> Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
Left behind...? This about Rowan...? <+++++> Yes. Partly. It's - it's -  Stu - do you believe in ---
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto. <+++++> And you, you-you're going?
I know what I'm doing. Where have You been? <+++++> Out ridin'. So... how you doin'?
Where are they? <+++++> I'm not sure.
I didn't. <+++++> No. You ate yours.
Yeh. <+++++> I appreciate your stickin' your neck out. I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
Who was the other man? <+++++> I don't know ÂÂ a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.
Oh. <+++++> Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
How much to get a permit to carry? <+++++> Well, you're talking big money now.
And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are. <+++++> And what are they?
How's Mama and the kids? <+++++> Growing -- all of them - every day. 318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
Well, that's what happens with grownups, too. <+++++> Did Daddy tease you?
'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you. <+++++> How do you know him?
Thanks, I'll take that. Champagne? <+++++> Lovely.
Was that talkative? <+++++> No, that was restful. Again.
You'll hate it in London. It's wet and miserable. A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized. Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing. <+++++> And the food sucks, I know.
shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now. <+++++> How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks. <+++++> I don't ever wanna see another ice cream...
What do you care? <+++++> Do we need this...?
The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too. I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know. <+++++> Gee, thanks boss.
Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9. <+++++> You're speaking of emotional investment?
Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score. So what do you think? <+++++> Tastes good.
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard! <+++++> Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty.
That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music-- <+++++> Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me to see the picture today.
Did you know that? <+++++> Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it. Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting style.
It says, "Ray." <+++++> Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with -- <+++++> Fuck you. Make time. Cause I bust my ass for you. I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.
Sure, but the end was so sudden. <+++++> He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight. I lost ten pounds in Rome <+++++> You're a reed, man. I gotta get Anna. Hang in there...
We gotta try. <+++++> Anybody else?
Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides. <+++++> He won't be back in a hurry?
Peter... <+++++> I've got be here for the police when they come. Then I've got to practise.
Seriously. <+++++> My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
Harder. Concentrate harder. <+++++> Me arm hurts.
What's that long building over there? <+++++> Storage, I think.
And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all. <+++++> And what do you do -- now?
Yeah. I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body. <+++++> I resent that innuendo! My wife is completely innocent.
Y-yes, sir. <+++++> Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love. <+++++> Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
Out of the Army? <+++++> He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena--
This looks familiar... <+++++> Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc-  I mean, he's the best.
Sure. And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone. Nearly snapped me in half. <+++++> I gotta go, Flip. Thanks.
 <+++++> Why?
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it. <+++++> Later.
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight. <+++++> With Dead Cat?
Yes. <+++++> What did she say?
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres. <+++++> It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
Oh? <+++++> You saved my life.
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs -- <+++++> Perk, remember?
I don't know. How long before it kills us? <+++++> Five seconds.
Elle, I can't. You don't understand. <+++++> Who could better understand than me?
Did I hear a yes? <+++++> Yes...
I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal. <+++++> Then you're going to kill me.
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements. <+++++> Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was...
Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport, called the number-- <+++++> I knew it, soon as I saw they were offering a reward.
Beeeee careful. <+++++> Come on Dorothy.
It's not worth it. Be with them instead. <+++++> It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected.
Wish I had a brother like you. <+++++> A girl says she loves you, you say something.
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick. <+++++> No, I just meant...
Oh, Mrs. Rand -- <+++++> Come, come, don't tell me how sorry you are that I should meet you this way.
You said that. <+++++> We're falling behind.
How close are you to getting this funding put together? <+++++> It's almost there. The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
Do the police want to arrest me? <+++++> Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
It was an information exchange. I got him first class collars and he got me good stories. We were friends for Chrissakes! <+++++> Alright. We'll drop that line for now. Next topic. Please comment on Pierce Patchett.
Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer." <+++++> Gross.
Well I don't know -- <+++++> You've done without it long enough, ma.
Yes sir.. <+++++> The wings..
You are beautiful! <+++++> No.
What for? <+++++> I'm going to puke in it...
Well that sucks. <+++++> It sucks.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time. <+++++> You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
That's not what I meant. I don't care about the sword. <+++++> What do you mean? Didn't you come back here for it?
I'm sorry. <+++++> I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
Sure did. <+++++> They're pretty. Learn it in the army?
There's still time to back-out. <+++++> Forget it. I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself. Where's the disk?
The world is on fire, Ellie. People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them! <+++++> I want to, Palmer -- more than anything. But it has to be real. It has to be true.
You're not a permanent part of her life. You're a distraction. <+++++> I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir. Are you alright sir? Are you okay?
The park? <+++++> Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce. <+++++> Please, not on my account.
Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and roses... and I'm really happy. Leave a message. BEEP. <+++++> Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed.
Well... I guess I should go. Perhaps we could get together again? <+++++> Certainly. But now the children of the night are calling me.
Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married? <+++++> Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
Takes those things for granted. Why does she think I lugged her all the way from MiamiÂ  for the love of it? <+++++> Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago.
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner. <+++++> She's a treasure she is.
How do you know? <+++++> Look more closely.
Guess I'll just keep working. <+++++> What're you crazy?
Marylin! <+++++> It's okay Joe.
Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace? <+++++> Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
Go to hell. <+++++> It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else.
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan. I think someone's gunning for you. <+++++> You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me? <+++++> Sure. We can practice talking.
Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed. You realize how rarely they make that ruling? <+++++> I do.
That's right -- Topol. <+++++> But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
How are you doing, man? <+++++> Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job! <+++++> Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow? <+++++> Mind your own business. You just said that shit so you could look at her a little longer, anyway...
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway. <+++++> Why?
I'm not a stalker. <+++++> You know Wilmont?
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like thatÂ he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury. It softens 'em up. <+++++> Listen kid, I'm a soft tough too.
Watching TV. <+++++> I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
Fuck you. <+++++> Let me tell you something. Listen to me.
Oh, it's not my radio, sir. I picked it up in the communications center. <+++++> I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
No scars? <+++++> No scars.
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead. <+++++> When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.
O.K. How long do you think before I can come back? <+++++> Probably a year...
...you told me you were studying for your examination by the <u>Studiolo</u>... <+++++> And how good of <u>you</u> to remember it.
Hey, Dad, there's a strange fella sitting on the sofa there munchy- wunching lomticks of toast. <+++++> Aye, that's Joe. He... ummmm, lives here now. The lodger. That's what he is... he... he rents your room.
I thought everything was checked out. <+++++> I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
He kissed her. <+++++> Is that all?
It is possible, Holiness. <+++++> You are unharmed?
The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop. <+++++> It's Iggy Pop.
 <+++++> Did you see how they reacted to him?
Nuke...tell me something. Did you hit me with your right or your left? <+++++> My right.
Eastern Europe. Like what? Romania? Hungary? <+++++> Or Czechoslovakia. The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years. These are very intense people and they take things personally.
They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger. <+++++> How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
Do you hear that? That choir? Eddie, in here, that's what they call music! <+++++> Don't call again. It's not safe. I'll be in touch.
Richter! Call from Cohaagen. <+++++> This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.
Like her? I don't know if I ever liked her. It's just you want what you can't get. <+++++> I know what you mean.
And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge? <+++++> Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
All I saw was their lantern. <+++++> Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
Moving in? <+++++> I came right from the airport.
Harry? <+++++> I'm okay. I'm okay.
Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking? <+++++> My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me. <+++++> Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it.
What is it, your laundry? <+++++> Huh?
The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here... <+++++> You are a fine figure of a man.
Thanks, Charles. <+++++> No sweat, buddy.
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello. <+++++> No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
Strike out, eh? <+++++> Yeah. In the late innings. Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
Some plain soda. Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven... <+++++> That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
...and then my night man shows up when he feels like... <+++++> ...it.
I'll be waiting. <+++++> Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.
Monday. <+++++> Push it.
Not anymore. I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it. How about a little cold pheasant? <+++++> What happened?
They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital. I forget things sometimes. Since the w-w-war. <+++++> Yeah... me too.
Yeah. <+++++> I'm sorry about what happened.
Chief says... <+++++> He has medicine. Tell him we admire his people.
I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend. Enjoying your visit? <+++++> I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you. This is the only color they had left.
No. He did not. <+++++> Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
Who? <+++++> Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together. <+++++> You're gross. See that guy?
Don't be cruel. <+++++> Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
You know I don't think that. <+++++> Maybe not. But there's another thing ... like when you came in tonight --  I heard you ask your wife, "Who's that?
You? <+++++> Yeah me. King! But she betrayed me. She robbed me of my dream.
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody. <+++++> Have you been replaced?
I thought we talked about that. <+++++> We didn't talk about this. They took the little boy, Cobb.
Beautiful. <+++++> Beautiful.
Will Graham, Jack Crawford... <+++++> We got an ad order in tonight's "Tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now.
Here's another wire from Peter Warne. <+++++> Throw it in the basket. What's it say? "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter.
Then one day I saw a footprint in the sand -- and there you were --  It's a wonderful thing -- dinner for two. <+++++> You usually eat alone?
She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research. <+++++> And?
Last time I didn't. <+++++> Let's keep talkin', Wick. Just keep talkin' to me...
What do you drive? <+++++> I'm sorry?
Tuesday. <+++++> Where'd you get that dress?
He go back to the hotel? <+++++> Uh..he might of.
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert? <+++++> Yes. The Shubert.
I don't believe it! <+++++> I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living.
That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends. <+++++> He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
Oh, hi -- How was dinner? <+++++> Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair. Where were you?
A traveler, eh? <+++++> You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.
Get dressed. We're leaving. <+++++> You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it.
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami. <+++++> Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.
I'm ready. <+++++> But Sergeant...
I don't like no witnesses. <+++++> We won't breathe a word.
Bugsy, you and I don't need to be in business with Maranzano. We got more jobs than we can handle. That's not the problem. <+++++> So what is the problem?
Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful? <+++++> What are you talking about?
Well maybe I can get you something. <+++++> That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
Lied? What do you mean? <+++++> I . . . nothing. Just something he said. So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--
If you were directly above him, how did you see him? <+++++> I was inverted.
Whose justice? Yours or God's? When will you stop? <+++++> When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them. <+++++> I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind. <+++++> You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt. Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing? <+++++> Look, I haven't been near that... that refrigerator.
But nowhere near three million dollars worth. I would say maybe twenty thousand. <+++++> There was more than that.
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back. <+++++> I don't want to go back.
Boy, this is a mother dictionary. <+++++> Yeah, I've had it forever. I used to have this thing with marking the words that I looked up.
What? <+++++> ML, hold this for me.
What kind of a crash was it? <+++++> You seen my suitcase?
And Rome. <+++++> Do you ski? Don't tell me -- you're a lost cause! That's the next thing to deal with.
That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else. <+++++> I never knew.
What's wrong, Norman? <+++++> I'm feeling better.
-  We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying - <+++++> That Rosebud? Maybe some girl? There were a lot of them back in the early days, and -
Is it long and hanging down? <+++++> I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
Yeah? <+++++> Why are we doing this?
Interesting approach. What was his name? <+++++> Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
Where's you friend? <+++++> He's not coming...
We have to stop them from sending that message. <+++++> Agreed. Options?
You never gave us a chance... <+++++> I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.
Yeah. I mean besides that. They treating you all right? Food okay? <+++++> Yeah. I'm going home today. What do you want, Frankie?
How do you like my dress? <+++++> Beautiful.
Life is true. <+++++> Life is real.
Say, isn't that mistletoe? <+++++> Mm-hmmmmm.
Shut up. Let me see your grenades. <+++++> Why?
Hush. My employer wants a meeting. <+++++> Employer? The president?
But how? <+++++> BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer? <+++++> Christ! Wes, tell him. You know this stuff.
Danger's my middle name. <+++++> OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes.
You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything. <+++++> But Corrado... If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power. <+++++> We will hold. Their power is not unlimited.
And Bourne? Where's he now? <+++++> Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank. <+++++> Nice night for it. I'll have Louis send your car home.
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians! <+++++> Mozart -
Take a guess. <+++++> Does she have a cell phone? A way we can contact her?
Not at all. And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first. <+++++> My pleasure.
You got your wish. <+++++> But... I didn't wish... I didn't want him DEAD!
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job. <+++++> What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many. <+++++> She looks terrible, just awful.
It doesn't matter. <+++++> Nonsense! Course it matters.
Joe, be careful! <+++++> ...I've lost something. I must get it back.
What the fuck do you want? <+++++> I want to sit. I want to talk to you.
He translated it wrong. <+++++> What?
Nothing I can't finish later. <+++++> I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him. <+++++> He's conducting experiments of his own.
I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon. <+++++> Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
Are you sure? <+++++> I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him. We will.
What for? <+++++> Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.
Gimme the keys. <+++++> NO, but I will lock you in.
Miles? <+++++> Yes? Marylin?
I am going to church. <+++++> I understand of course. It is to be expected.
I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books. Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking. <+++++> You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.
Oh-huh. <+++++> Oh my!
Why not? <+++++> 'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh...
That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger. <+++++> Disappointment? J'etais destroyee! I was in bed for a week! Positively sick with fury!
-- please, please forgive me... <+++++> -- you know better...
Now just relax, okay? Everything's gonna be fine. <+++++> I don't think so, Jim. Maybe I shouldn't have--
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia. <+++++> Like a New Year's Day hangover.
I lived there for about nine months. <+++++> You lived in Japan, when?
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson. <+++++> Naturally I think so.
You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families! <+++++> They're friends of our enemy.
I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up. <+++++> Why tell me?
The key, goddamit, the key! <+++++> Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Making Hutch David Soul? <+++++> Right. The blond guy.
You burn, you pine, you perish? <+++++> Who is she?
You're hurt. <+++++> Nothing broken. C'mon, we have to hurry.
They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away. <+++++> That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.
I'm John McClane. <+++++> Argyle. I'm your limo driver. Hey, nice bag.
Give us time. <+++++> Like hugging a lamp post.
 <+++++> Well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?
Something on your mind, Lisa? <+++++> It doesn't make sense to me.
Oh no, I couldn't. <+++++> It's for you, John. It's all for you. Go ahead, let them see you.
What's the matter, Sugar? <+++++> I don't know. All of a sudden, I'm thirsty.
How about this one? <+++++> Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
Why? <+++++> It's too... elegant. The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step...
...a car. <+++++> That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
Huh? <+++++> Vegetables.
Casandra. Old girlfriend? <+++++> Something like that.
Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber." <+++++> I'll take my chances.
You think so? <+++++> It's Y. O. H.
Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex. <+++++> Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us.
Come on, Sid. Give me the gun. <+++++> No, Sid.
You might find a bullet through that head... <+++++> If you did that, you'd get nothing except the police after you. If you wait -- I'll give you your six thousand back --
What? Johnny, what's wrong? <+++++> It's Mom.
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't. <+++++> That fuckin did it!
What did it smell like? <+++++> It was very specific.
Who else did? Did Valentin? <+++++> Yes.
Okay. <+++++> Terry! Slow down.
Yeah. <+++++> Fucking women, man...
It's that asshole Zach isn't it ? <+++++> Zach from work ?
You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch? <+++++> Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just... <+++++> No, it's not...
 <+++++> Yes. Packed and with an inventory.
If they're so rich, why are you working at all ? <+++++> I just want to have something that's mine, you know ? It's like living off of their money is fun and all.
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I... <+++++> There's nothing they can do to me.
The shylock's the good guy. <+++++> The shylock? He's barely mentioned. And it's not believable the wife would get a settlement that fast.
Maybe you could take a better look at the picture... might stir up something. <+++++> I um... no, I don't think so...
I didn't get you? <+++++> Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
Sir? <+++++> Of them.
Look, are we going to do it or not? <+++++> Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too. You might even call it "love." <+++++> Okay, that's IT!! !
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show. <+++++> Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but... <+++++> All right! Then call! At least, call!
This place, the equipment. What it must have cost. Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask? <+++++> I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
Who's sitting here? <+++++> Your homie, Glenn. Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back.
It's going to be a cozy weekend. <+++++> What is?
Was he depressed? <+++++> No. He didn't seem to be. Do you think he drowned himself?
I didn't. <+++++> Thank you.
No one else had the combination of that safe. You took them. What did you do with them? <+++++> What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
...deer. <+++++> I beg your pardon?
I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of -- <+++++> I don't think so...
34   CONTINUED: <+++++> Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?
And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience - <+++++> But there is a bright side though.
Rachel! They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them. <+++++> Stop throwing names at me.
Dixie McCoy didn't. <+++++> The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
There is no weather in space. <+++++> I never get tired of that joke.
Did I scare you? <+++++> No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
You have good instincts when it comes to things like that? <+++++> Like what?
Okay, I'll try. But, listen... If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time. <+++++> Ray...please try. I really miss you. Okay. Bye.
Oh... Well. <+++++> The car broke down.
Do you know what you're going to do? <+++++> Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
You'll go to the prison hospital. <+++++> Under arrest for murder.
I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember? <+++++> Come on. Tell me what you do know.
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience... <+++++> And we didnÂt want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your moneyÂs worth.
June, July ... August? <+++++> The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
I mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise. Cheers. <+++++> Cheers.
I designed it myself. What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job? <+++++> Just the face.
Butch called. <+++++> Did he?
But not the only victim, right? <+++++> My, my, my, how did things turn so hostile so quickly?
Secrets. <+++++> Ah.
I hate public transport. <+++++> What?
You understand what I'm sayin'? <+++++> Carter, shut up!
I missed you, is all. It's dull around here working alone...Smelling all that sweet cologne.... <+++++> Put me down....
Raymond, grab the tapes. We're leaving! <+++++> Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
It's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone. <+++++> Yes. I think so, too.
The one that left you? <+++++> That's right. That one.
Because it's true. <+++++> I don't believe you.
And what does that mean? <+++++> Means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didn't at least try to.
Promise you'll turn around if you get tired. <+++++> I will. Bye.
My dear Aulon...  That's fine... <+++++> Jeanne's been badly injured! She jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat!
Congratulations. <+++++> Get on the phone. Send out a casting call. Call every agent in town. I want to see everybody. Everybody.
We got boo-coo movement. 3rd Battalion just got hit 15 kliks north of here. <+++++> Yeah, they had claymores strung up in the trees, blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. BAAD SHIT.
What guy? <+++++> There's somebody else on this boat.
What? Come on! <+++++> I'm sorry, 'cause you know Mikey, the fuckin guy loves animals, and this is the last person you'd want this to happen to.
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog! <+++++> Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now... <+++++> How ya feeling?
Someone else was there. <+++++> The door was locked from your side.
See what you don't know is you're already in the last two minutes of your life. <+++++> You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
That was some shit, huh? <+++++> Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
See, I wasn't making shit up, man. <+++++> No.
Bye, Troy! <+++++> Bye, Adam!
This isn't gonna get you laid, you know. <+++++> Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad? <+++++> Emma! I will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner!
I'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a Coke. <+++++> Fine. Julie, why don't you make a food run? What's around here?
Are you AFRAID? <+++++> GOOD MORNING!
Do you know what he's talking about? <+++++> I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.
Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we? <+++++> 
Waitaminute - <+++++> You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
You cannot marry Wessex! <+++++> If not Wessex the Queen will know the cause and there will be no more Will Shakespeare.
What'd you all talk about? <+++++> Pearl and John.
I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be. You know, like in the movies. <+++++> That's the problem. When you're a kid you think life is gonna be like the movies.
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do. <+++++> Neither do I.
If it is an alien spacecraft -- <+++++> Save your breath. It's not an alien spacecraft.
How can I? <+++++> I don't know. Just help me. Give me a cigarette.
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here. <+++++> How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?
I haven't surfed since I got here. <+++++> 
I've got a meeting... <+++++> What are you paying me for?
Why? What do you mean? <+++++> Uh...using Josh like that.
In love? <+++++> Out--
Since right after we lost our son. <+++++> You mean after he lost your son.
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere. Miss Four Corners. <+++++> What made you want to be a fighter?
I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel. <+++++> You mean the nerve.
Aren't you forgetting about Selena? <+++++> She'll forget about us eventually.
I'll think about it. <+++++> Don't think.
Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three. <+++++> Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
Yes, darling. <+++++> Did you ever make a wish?
What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend? <+++++> I'm not interested in you. You disgust me.
He's all doped up. <+++++> I want to talk to him.
You two ok? <+++++> Our car won't start.
Six months of tests. If you were married you got a state-room. Otherwise it was bunks. <+++++> Okay, good reason. Then what?
But I do. <+++++> Why?
I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly -- <+++++> Are you afraid of me?
Which branch of the service? <+++++> Strategic Air Command.
OUCH !!! GODDAMMIT that hurts !!! ! <+++++> I told him not to sit down in there.....
What do you say to that? <+++++> I say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission. <+++++> Transporter room. Status.
Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States. <+++++> Sounds like you need a rest.
No... no training. <+++++> Psych major?
You can't just come in here. <+++++> The door was open, I got a call --
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed? <+++++> I'll have to re-energize.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses. <+++++> You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.
What did you say? <+++++> They fired everyone.
You're close, Crash, you want me to run you? I'll run you! <+++++> You want me to call you a cocksucker? !
You have cash. What do you need me for? <+++++> C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em.
It was a play. <+++++> Boys like him have -- expectations.
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me! <+++++> You shame yourself.
I see. Yes, of course. <+++++> So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council? <+++++> Yeah, that'll do for openers!
How? <+++++> Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.
He said it was a clue? <+++++> Maybe something to do with Zorro.
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't. <+++++> I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard. <+++++> Twice.
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall forÂ <+++++> I want it as soon as possible.
Drink up me hearties, yo ho ... <+++++> What? What was that? Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know? <+++++> What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
Julie Dwyer died. <+++++> Yeah, right.
You were prying before? <+++++> Yes, this afternoon. I was grilling Ann about your marriage this afternoon.
Mints? <+++++> Copped a tin of Altoids at the car wash.
Keep it between us girls? <+++++> What's that fucker ever done for us?
Never call him that. He's strictly an illusionist. <+++++> What's the difference?
Chewie's right. We must try to save Han. <+++++> There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.
He will be odd, different. <+++++> Well, physiologically, he...	won't quite fit.
You know, that would be like a great thing. <+++++> What?
I told you I don't remember. <+++++> After that she left the party to go to him.
No I didn't. <+++++> Is this because of your dad?
Can I ask you something? <+++++> Yes.
General Washington, is there actually going to be a compromise, I mean, a 'deal' with England? <+++++> And is that the most horrible thing in the world?
I wonder what's keeping His Excellency? <+++++> Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
What? <+++++> I think... ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet? <+++++> Why?
You won't. You won't have to. <+++++> But I wouldn't mind comin' back in an hour just to see your pretty face!
The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on... <+++++> You don't have anything to worry about. He hasn't spoken a word in 15 years.
Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them? <+++++> How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
I see. <+++++> I'm not even sure why.
Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York. <+++++> What do you mean?
Massachussettans aren't. <+++++> 'Course they're also so rich.
Would you like part of this? ....It's not much. <+++++> All the insides are gone!
He can't prove anything, John. He can't turn us in. <+++++> He can kill us. I don't know about you, but my life is worth thirty- thousand dollars.
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace. <+++++> Then why do you try to get in?
Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff. <+++++> I was never stiffer in my life.
What are you doing here! ? <+++++> Looking for Hal. Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her. <+++++> Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
Ha Ha. <+++++> Heh heh.
Must be in love to manage that. <+++++> Doesn't know the meaning of the word.
But you didn't see it, right? <+++++> Like I said, I was in the kitchen.
I'm looking for Frank Mackey. <+++++> No.
How fast does this go? <+++++> With the right wind, 15-20 knots.
Look, Johanna... <+++++> I said good night!
The point is, love isn't about money or social standing or age, it's about connecting with someone, having things in common kindred spirits. <+++++> Fuck kindred spirits. My little Puffy here's gonna tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat.
There is a provisory by- law in our charter. Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five. <+++++> You're taking this too far, Drew.
Both, sir. <+++++> Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway? <+++++> Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
Tor, I should be getting home. <+++++> Nonsense! You must try our hot glug.
I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood. <+++++> You're NOT going to faint.
Fisher, let him talk. <+++++> But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.
Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her. <+++++> And burn the map and retrieve the key.
'Scuse me. <+++++> I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public.
If that's for me, tear it up! <+++++> Take a top coat.
At ease men. <+++++> Like throwing gasoline on a fire...
What? <+++++> Chess. Chess is often used as well.
If I could trouble the Baron to come and see this beautiful room. I have ordered champagne. Perhaps the Baroness could join us. <+++++> Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute! We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out. <+++++> Deal the cards.
Oh... I guess I'll die now. <+++++> Okay... maybe that would be best.
He was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person. <+++++> He's makin' threats in there.
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties. <+++++> Oh, that's right. You're "clueless."
Yeah, if you're Superfly. <+++++> That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!
But Alfredo, what you're saying is horrifying! <+++++> I know. But take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example! I think about it a lot...How is it possible for...
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person. <+++++> It's nice.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now. <+++++> Whatta you doing out there?
He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does. <+++++> You don't know what he thinks.
Why him? <+++++> In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed. <+++++> I join the F.B.I. I ask for fieldwork. They say, "Bill, you're too fucking= smart for field work."
What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there! <+++++> We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help.
What's your brand? <+++++> Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here.
Yes -- <+++++> Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
Joseph Harbin. <+++++> Joseph Harbin? No...no.
. Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue... <+++++> Charlie? Was I dead?
It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking. <+++++> Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
That's a nasty scratch on your neck. <+++++> I have a passionate girlfriend.
I will play him. Bring it tomorrow. <+++++> It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
You're not coming, Alex. <+++++> Yes I am...
I care. Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge? <+++++> Frogs?
Where'd you wire him? <+++++> On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
What for? <+++++> Lobotomy!
Don't play innocent. Somebody named Gordon Cole. <+++++> Gordon Cole?
Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you. <+++++> Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is! But I've never seen it used at night before. <+++++> Come over here.
Michael... <+++++> It's all right, baby. We're safe...
Rock whores. <+++++> You ain't seen nothin' like these rock whores. They ass be young man. They got that fine young pussy.
I'm pretty good at signatures myself. <+++++> Oh my God. I heard her scream again. What are they doing to her? Why can't I do anything to stop them?
Is the hostage injured? <+++++> Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
 <+++++> Surely you don't think Beverly was involved!
Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too. <+++++> Thanks.
Don't. <+++++> Don't look?
So I'm learning. <+++++> He's not even aware of it. When you've got his attention you feel like you're the only person in the world.
That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. He's gone. <+++++> Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube.
What makes him so special? <+++++> None of your business.
This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter. <+++++> Oh!
The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization. <+++++> You said it!
Can you afford this place? <+++++> Yeah.
As appealing as that sounds... <+++++> Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?
It's a package deal. You get the phone with the office. <+++++> Detective Mills here. Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back...  What? Why?
It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take. <+++++> None of that matters. Our communications equipment's been destroyed.
Was the Baron joking, or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits. <+++++> Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking. <+++++> How long you and me known each other?
Huh? <+++++> I don't pimp that. You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole.
Nice. <+++++> Arterial silk.
You may speak. <+++++> I have a job for you and I don't have much time.
What the hell are you doing? <+++++> Who's Camille?
You're incorrigible! <+++++> Does that mean you love me?
Okay, sure, Mick. <+++++> Caesar, you still got the money?
Thanks. Just some pills. <+++++> Only two bucks. Shave as well...
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch. <+++++> Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission. How's Melville?
Sam... <+++++> Put Kelly on too.
You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway. Don't lose your confidence. Don't lose your edge. <+++++> It's the same choice you made.
The Prison of Belle Sur. <+++++> Come, we have a boat waiting.
My dear, dear friends! Whatever would I do without you! <+++++> Mister Powell!
We're gonna blow up the powder magazine. <+++++> What?
What's wrong with your paisley tie? <+++++> Ellie, it was a formal party...
We have an enlisted man's club at the post. <+++++> Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
You tell me, man. <+++++> No. You tell me, Shu.
Well, many reasons, actually... <+++++> Tell me one?
Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb. <+++++> 'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ? <+++++> I . . ..
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel? <+++++> Regent Beverly Wilshire. I bet you know it.
Hello. You're back again, huh? <+++++> yeah, yes, hi, hello.
You can't go out there. <+++++> But I really should get home.
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan. <+++++> What plan?
Maybe it's nice on the other side. Them pitchers--them little pos'cards-- they was real pretty. <+++++> Aw, sure. This here's jus' a part of it. Ain't no sense a gettin' scairt right off.
And then the nightmares started. They were all different, but all the same. They were all about murder. And the murders were all happening. <+++++> And how did Lamar become involved?
Starling - <+++++> But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!
Put it down. Put it on the ground. <+++++> Okay...
Up. <+++++> What? Up?
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew. <+++++> That's her? Bianca's sister?
It's the story or Salome. I think I'll have DeMille direct it. <+++++> Uh-huh.
He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ... <+++++> Trauma.
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe... <+++++> I'll call you.
Edward Baines, I presume. Hi, Ed. I'm Pete. <+++++> Do you think that's funny?
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go. <+++++> Really.
You are. <+++++> I am.
Oh! <+++++> The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
Are you sure? <+++++> Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
My son ... what's the matter? <+++++> Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon. <+++++> Please! Don't say those words. Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news.
You swear? <+++++> Yeah. Go out there, check it out, see what it's like.
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way. <+++++> There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city!
 <+++++> But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
John Mapplethorpe. How are you. Hi. <+++++> Good to know you, John.
No, no no.... <+++++> Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!
I'll be alright. <+++++> No, me, me, me. Thank you.
I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert immediately. You can tell the commissioner it's a code red. <+++++> But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
He says he doesn't know. Why don't you cook whatever's there? <+++++> It looks like a whole roast.
Mr. Jefferson Carver? <+++++> Please, call me Mordechai.
She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree. <+++++> Are you going to see Elizabeth while you're here?
What do they look like?... <+++++> Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
Right, of course. I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night. <+++++> It's strange. I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.
I didn't finish talking to you! <+++++> Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
We got it. On your feet. <+++++> I want to sleep. Can I sleep here.
In another week or so you'll move Klingman out, which leaves you with only one technicality. The license, which is now in Klingman's name. <+++++> Turnbull is a good man.
...I feel that... <+++++> "A liaison position with the Opera."
Do you really think so? <+++++> You know it is.
Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police. <+++++> Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place. What'd he exactly say when he called you?
I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him? <+++++> No. All you need is to want to be the best.
Well, you have knocked me for a hell of a loop, old man. A hell of a loop. <+++++> I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock.
Oh, it's okay, then. 'Cause you're just taking out the garbage... <+++++> Yeah, like that... But, anyway, nobody gets out of this alive. Even if we quit smoking and cut out red meat. Everybody dies.
Thank you. <+++++> Read the card.
Look at that. A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it. <+++++> Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
You know, you -- <+++++> Shut up. I got no interest in you, Xavier,  or your... X-Men.
It's out of focus. <+++++> No -- that's atmosphere. Cloud layer.
I love you. I always will. <+++++> Oh, God... Kyle. I need you so much.
What the hell do you want? <+++++> I want to help. I'm part of this squad...
I thank you. <+++++> You're welcome.
Are you Klingman? <+++++> Who's asking?
 <+++++> You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?
Very funny... <+++++> Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...
I don't care. They're out. <+++++> Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late.
Why don't you pick him up yourself? <+++++> Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.
This is serious! I don't have my license. He was my ride. <+++++> I'm sorry. I'm just here to shower.
Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again. Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine-- <+++++> Goodnight, Senator--
Tower, say again! ! <+++++> The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
Just be natural, goddamit. <+++++> How long since your last confession, my son?
No. <+++++> Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two. <+++++> Nope. They'll stay out on the Spade country where they got friends.
Your lady friend did. <+++++> The ladyÂs not a friend. SheÂs a whore. Someone at a special screening I attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an Austrian here in London.
Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins. <+++++> Martin, we hired the best man we could find.
Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done. <+++++> Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money.
In that place? <+++++> Uh-huh.
How does it work? <+++++> 
Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer. Follow his orders to your death. <+++++> Get it up!
You feeling better Franny? <+++++> Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
So, you never heard of him. <+++++> Nope.
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are -- <+++++> Finding out where she is.
Goddamnit-- <+++++> --shit--
Who is he? <+++++> Why must he be anybody?
Seymour! Hello! What are you doing here? <+++++> Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after? <+++++> If you're going to insult me --
I'm only allowed "G" movies. <+++++> Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched "Dog Day Afternoon!"
You put him down or don't bother coming back. <+++++> But...
You can't forgive me. After what I've done. I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad. <+++++> I forgive you.
Robert Paulson? <+++++> Robert Paulson is dead. He's dead, because of you...
...That's awful. I hope you killed, that asshole? <+++++> ...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters.
It was a different time, son. And you're a better man than that. <+++++> I see, do as I say, not as I do.
I guess it's time to hit the road. <+++++> Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral.
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you? <+++++> Yeah... let me think about it.
That's good. Now, seven more like that while I make fuses. <+++++> I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this.
I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds? <+++++> Deeds?
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan. <+++++> Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
My generosity is not so large as that. <+++++> What do you want with me?
Four. <+++++> No.
Thank you VERY much indeed. <+++++> Now stop it!
Where's who? <+++++> You won't even tell us?
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you. <+++++> What's he know?
Can't hurt... <+++++> Can't hurt? I had to get him back his job.
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart? <+++++> Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.
Well, I guess he's found one. <+++++> Joe, you do get around.
No kidding. <+++++> What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
What are you talking about? You can't be serious. <+++++> I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie.
Oooooh. Damn! Not so loud. Turn down the music. <+++++> What music? There ain't no music.
Meaning? <+++++> Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps.
Do you feel you have a chance? <+++++> Maybe --
Get - Get up! Get up! <+++++> I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Just the ten thousand'll be fine. <+++++> Got something to show me first?
All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes. I've heard stuff. <+++++> What stuff?
I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it. <+++++> I know you believe that.
What is this place? <+++++> Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
-- No. No really. <+++++> Well, what is it, honey?
 <+++++> So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
You can tell Father Murray to -- <+++++> At ease! He also says, quote: All you sack rats better show up for the services and no bull from anybody. Unquote. At ease!
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever. <+++++> No. They all do.
Figured it out. <+++++> Figured what out?
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German? <+++++> Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
India... <+++++> Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in --
If you know how to escape, why don't you...? <+++++> Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right? 'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!
So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each. 'Cool? How much air in yours? <+++++> Maybe half. Not even.
It's Vince and Justin. <+++++> Who's that?
I'm sorry, I'm not. I'm just another guy. Morpheus is the one that matters. <+++++> No, Neo. That's not true. It can't be true.
Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there. <+++++> I don't know what I've got.
I'm not very bright, I guess. <+++++> I wouldn't say that. Careless, maybe.
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already? Let's try again--  Is your name Porter? <+++++> Ss'kya'ta'.
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you. <+++++> Is that supposed to frighten me?
In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street. <+++++> You don't say! Why I had no idea -
Layton! Oh shit! <+++++> What is it?
I'm sorry. <+++++> Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
Running your broker scam, you mean. <+++++> You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together.
Hello? <+++++> Hello, Mrs. Webster. Is China there?
I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked! <+++++> Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
You're on his side all of the sudden? <+++++> A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny. <+++++> What's a nanny do?
Well--me, too! <+++++> But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
Yeah. <+++++> That's where I get off.
What're you doing? <+++++> Oh ... I was just hoping for something to drink. But it seems the old lady was dry. Not even a bottle of cooking sherry.
... Ben, really... <+++++> ... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank you very much. ... All right, Robert, I'm all yours.
Get the fuck outta here. <+++++> Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile.
Good morning, Mr. Dyle. <+++++> Reggie?
You're crazy. <+++++> I'm you, I take that money and get outta town while you can.
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence. <+++++> You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
No, I never. What? <+++++> I been in the penitentiary for four years.
A private investigator... YouÂre not Austrian? <+++++> Should I be?
Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again. <+++++> Well done.
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper. <+++++> How would I know? I once bet a horse. He went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five.
Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry? <+++++> Not really.
He says he's leaving the island sir. <+++++> Don't let him do that.
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened? <+++++> I met a man with sharp nails.
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control. <+++++> Your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart. It may have killed one of my men. No one goes near that thing.
I have to talk to you. <+++++> Call the A.M.A. ...I can't talk now. ...tell them you're Dr. Somebody... you have to find this nurse...
After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated. <+++++> Is this becoming complicated?
 <+++++> And Justice and FBI know all this?
They're... around. <+++++> Yeah? So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer? I'm a busy man.
What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer. <+++++> Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn. <+++++> Okay, I'm very sorry. My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem! Huh?
Things are quite serious, I should say. <+++++> We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
I didn't mean it that way. I meant only that I am not in a position to ask favors. <+++++> Ask this one favor --
Neither do I. <+++++> Don't protect him.
You bet. <+++++> and totally irrelevant.
Yes. <+++++> And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth. <+++++> Whatta you wanna do?
They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know? <+++++> Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
Is everything alright? <+++++> Fine.
And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout. <+++++> There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
So far, you have four and I only have two! <+++++> Then, take blood parasites. It's yours. Now we each have three.
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing? <+++++> Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.
Listen -- could you stop crying, please? <+++++> No, I couldn't.
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target. I forgot your question? <+++++> You plan on driving trucks all your life?
That feels so great. <+++++> Good...
I can really rape them on this! Can I at least tell them you'll think about it? <+++++> No. Tell them I'll do it. But I want more posters all over Rome.
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice? <+++++> Well...
He must have known Charles pretty well. <+++++> How can you tell?
"Escape"? <+++++> In case things get too intense. It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather. Things can get pretty wild...
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila. <+++++> And what did you do tonight, honey?
What's he got that I haven't got? <+++++> Well, he has a straw hat--
Thank you. <+++++> It's everything we wanted. A very good read. A terrific piece of work. So, here's to you and Suez.
Why? What have you been thinking about? <+++++> How to die, mostly.
Gonna be some people at my house tonight. Maybe you can make it. <+++++> Where?
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here. <+++++> I'll try, Captain.
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her. <+++++> She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but -- <+++++> No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
Do you mind if I come down and see it? <+++++> Not at all.

Mom? <+++++> I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
I don't like what's happening. <+++++> In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room.
What's up, Walter? <+++++> I came over to see you. I brought something...I wanted to show you.
Hi, Richard. <+++++> What are you doing?
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you. <+++++> It's never the sea! It's Roberto, Mamma, that stupid actress... Oh shit! Jacques, what do you know?
Everyone's working an angle, right? <+++++> There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are!
Jesus. <+++++> She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life? <+++++> I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
Yes. <+++++> I don't believe it!
Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>. Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>! <+++++> Get out!
That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint. <+++++> That's right.
It might even be why I came back. <+++++> You had no right. Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
Vitamins will it be then? <+++++> Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot.
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it! <+++++> Look at me. These aren't lungs. These are... Tanks. How long can you hold your breath?
If a soldier loses his legs in a war. Is he the same guy? Sure he is. <+++++> But you can still see him.
No. Tell me what you want to say. <+++++> Answer it.
I wanna let my brother know where I am. <+++++> D'you really wanna call?
Separate bedrooms? <+++++> Yes.
Well, I am not a crook. I have never made a dime from public service ... <+++++> Oh God, I'm going to throw up.
Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code. It wasn't easy but I figured it out. It spelled your name. <+++++> Why didn't Birdson just say so?
Give me your coat. <+++++> Let it ride for a while.
What do you think? <+++++> We, too, you know. It was disastrous.
Yes? <+++++> I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
I'm not against marriage per se. But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again. <+++++> Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly.
Isn't she lovely? <+++++> Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy it from me and I get 10% commission. <+++++> What do I get?
Oh no, it can't come now. <+++++> It must come.
Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was... Enough to almost kill him. <+++++> But you didn't.
You want to get out of here? <+++++> What?
Because obviously she existed, right? <+++++> I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart. She was the most vital woman I ever met.
Should I? <+++++> I donÂt know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
Yes, well... <+++++> You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
That's not your affair. Name. <+++++> Joad.
Ploughman's Lunch. Traditional English fare. <+++++> U-huh.
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55. <+++++> There's no rule!
That's bullshit. <+++++> Is it?
Let's stay for a while. <+++++> OK.
I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps. <+++++> Sister, if I knew the answer to that I sure as hell wouldn't be here.
I was the next man. <+++++> Ships that pass in the night...
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things. <+++++> I'm tired, too, Frank. If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye.
What for? That guys a dick. <+++++> I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now ! <+++++> What is your position ?
And what are you going to do? ! <+++++> I'm going to try and buy you some time. I can get to the bridge from here.
How? <+++++> Mrs. Bundy, you said something about Santa Cruz. About seagulls getting lost in the fog, and heading in for the lights.
Tom, you're all heart. <+++++> Listen cooky, you want to make sure that man rests before he plays; it's in all our interests.
You stole this truck. <+++++> You stole this truck!
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour." <+++++> You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled. At that moment -- I just knew. How did you know with Molly? <+++++> She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
I'm sorry... <+++++> Shut up, you dummy. Who did this to you?
OPEN THE DOOR. <+++++> I'm coming!
What you see? <+++++> That pump was full of money. I saw where they put it. Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it.
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars. <+++++> What do you mean?
What about me? <+++++> Not quiet yet.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more. <+++++> What do I exude?
Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him. Believe me, everything is fine. <+++++> Everything is not fine!
Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away. <+++++> All?
You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried. <+++++> What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square... I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd... <+++++> Go ahead.
The doctor'll be back in a minute. <+++++> Nona, please.
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land. <+++++> Yeah, I'll do that.
All right, let's have a rematch. <+++++> I thought you had to go to the mainland today. Aren't you going to miss the ferry?
And you've never seen anything like that? <+++++> No. It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
That's... <+++++> "...for my father."
We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that? <+++++> I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.

Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately. <+++++> Captain... I'd like to go along...
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese. <+++++> Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal. <+++++> Can't we get a couple whores over?
How can you do it to yourself? <+++++> I don't get you.
Daniels. <+++++> Okay.
He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight. <+++++> And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
How do you know what kind of sex they had? <+++++> I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking.
You mean... when the car went off the bridge? <+++++> Wow you are out of it.
Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her. Since then, forget it. <+++++> She doesn't have anything to do with it! You understand that? Mother? This is me!
This is Inga. They thought you might need an assistant temporarily. <+++++> How do you do?
It's coming -- I rode on ahead. I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot... <+++++> I know...
Maybe cause he's smart. <+++++> Smarter than us.
Dad. <+++++> Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid. Er, guy. Man.

The hell I can't! <+++++> I need you ...
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them? Where is Marmont? Where is Mortier? <+++++> The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet. Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.
I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical changes. <+++++> Damn straight.
Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.? <+++++> Bailey, Brackman.
And you say he doesn't remember any of it? <+++++> Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
And you set me up. <+++++> Always wanted to rob that casino, Rudy. Way back when I worked there. What better way than to get some guys to rob it for me.
Where are we, baby? <+++++> Where we'll always be...

We could laze around here a while longer. <+++++> 
Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark. <+++++> On my way.

Listen. I got a lot of respect for her, sir. That's about as good a one as I know to tell you. <+++++> Well, it's not good enough. Just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit? Guy like you.

Don't go. <+++++> This is important to me.
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it? <+++++> I'm not using him again for anything. He was worthless. You have bridge here Saturday?
Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved. Thirty acknowledged the recall. That makes four shot down. <+++++> Hello, are you still there?...Uh-huh...I'll be right back. We're still working this thing out.
Shoot me. <+++++> What's it say?

Sort of? <+++++> Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech. <+++++> It better be. Last time you had me introduce a dead guy.
It's very late. <+++++> Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
You know, you know how you take... <+++++> Yeah.
You tellin' the truth. <+++++> Go to your windows and yell out, scream with all the life you can muster up inside your assaulted, bruised and battered bodies.
What you doing to my nephew? <+++++> Ah, baby...I thought this was you. Craig, what are you doing to me?

How come everybody turns out to be a crook? <+++++> Don't talk. Don't talk!
I'm having the floor fixed, <+++++> And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal. <+++++> That's a strange attitude.
That's not his knee. Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain. <+++++> Anything else you want to tell me?
You did well... <+++++> I didn't wait long. One day I was going to Mass, like I do every day, when the same strange wind started blowing again...
Do you? <+++++> I think somewhere between Roderick Bledsoe's club and his house, Wade ran into Buddy Deeds.
Then why are you eating alone? <+++++> I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me. <+++++> Let him trust Quintus.
Not really? <+++++> I was upset.
We're dead. We're dead, We are dead...  What are we going to do? ! <+++++> I don't know...
Sorry. You've lost me... <+++++> I'm asking what you're here for.
You did? <+++++> Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.
It's just his mind poured out on paper. I don't think it's going to give us any specifics. <+++++> Looking around... I've got a bad feeling these murders are his life's work.
No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes JellÂO. <+++++> What does Charlie think about that?
I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files? <+++++> John, <u>stop</u> <u>it</u>. The case is on its ass, you're closed.
Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State? <+++++> Believe me, you don't understand. They wouldn't sit down at the same table.
How do you know I come from America? <+++++> We hear. We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
She's fine. <+++++> Can I speak with her?
No... But... <+++++> One day he's gonna find out what we're up to with Mr. Reindeer, and he could cause us a lot of trouble.
I don't care. <+++++> With all due respect, you damn well better care because if you try to stonewall them again, there'll be blood on the floor.
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE! <+++++> Oh, Jesus -- Nancy! Hey! We got a fire!
Oh my son, my poor son! <+++++> Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I.
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills. <+++++> You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
Could we hear to China? <+++++> On that old shortwave? Maybe on a clear night. Come on now, under the covers.
Ask him. I don't know. <+++++> I'm asking you.

Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth. <+++++> He didn't tell me you was a fuck- up, either. You played the Big Con since then.
Call the police. Okay, that's one option. <+++++> That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
What is this? <+++++> I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife. <+++++> Wait.
Buzz? What are we doing this for? <+++++> We got to do something. Don't we?
Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long? ! <+++++> Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best. C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this... <+++++> I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven. He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me...
Half an hour later, who turns up? Batman. Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway. No place to change. <+++++> Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
...I'm sorry. <+++++> We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
Where do we go? <+++++> When you find the guy, you'll know.
You walk past me? <+++++> Hey. This is Shelly.
Sure... <+++++> Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
Report. <+++++> We're still in Earth orbit.
So you're going to be a grandfather. <+++++> And I'm still just a lad myself.
So I waited to tell you. Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best, maybe I was wr... <+++++> You lied. If you lied <u>then</u>, maybe you're lying <u>now</u>.
Are you having an affair? <+++++> Jesus Christ, where'd that come from? I have a late lunch by myself and now I'm fucking somebody?
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting... <+++++> He's not in, Sir.
What do you think? <+++++> Sounds like a plan.
George, I'm sorry. <+++++> Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!
She's at work. I'm her mother. <+++++> Oh. I thought today was Saturday.
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper. <+++++> Watch your tenses.
I know. <+++++> I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
It's a curse to be old. How you feel? <+++++> I feel fine.
I have a feeling that you're not used to being alone. <+++++> That seems to apply to you also...
How did he die? <+++++> He was murdered.
So you were looking for a new challenge. <+++++> Well, plus the money ain't that bad.
Barbara. <+++++> Yes, Barbara. She was very pretty.
Yah. <+++++> But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
I don't care. <+++++> Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
Attaboy! Come on, Bruce. <+++++> Where are we going?
No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city. Near the Plaza del Sol. <+++++> I'm sorry, sir. A year ago there was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso. This is the new Hotel Paraiso.
I wrote sixty-three songs this year. They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight. <+++++> I just saw Joe. He's here.
Oh, Mr. Baxter -- I'm glad you're here -- I was just going to get the passkey. <+++++> What for?
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court. <+++++> I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
It's not just cactus. There's the nopals, the yuccas-- <+++++> Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
Who? <+++++> Twombley.
No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos. <+++++> But those are our people...
Well, could there be any position... further down the trough? <+++++> I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
What's going on, my friend? <+++++> You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
Oh my G-d. <+++++> Yes. And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana.
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car. <+++++> Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed. <+++++> I'm glad you think so, but I'm picturing a debt-ridden, thirty-two year-old mother whose ex-husband is being compared to Pablo Escobar.
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy? <+++++> -- what guy?
What's so fucking funny? <+++++> Those aren't guards. They're valets.
Nervous? <+++++> ...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
It says here, name Danger Powers. <+++++> Danger's my middle name.
Is he still alive? <+++++> Yeah... And still in Messina. He's my uncle.
It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times. <+++++> Really? wow.
El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country. <+++++> Her dance has pleased me.
Humans. <+++++> Who?
Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both? <+++++> -- Me? Neither.
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket? <+++++> No.
Can I get you anything? Food? Cake? Watered down champagne punch? <+++++> I'm fine. You throw quite a party. I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
Masters of our own destiny. <+++++> So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?
The name is Lonnegan. <+++++> Make sure you see cash from this guy, Eddie. He's got the name for bettin' money he don't have.
You were wonderful! <+++++> Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad. <+++++> A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
I just needed to do a couple of things. And I needed to tell you something. <+++++> Tell me.
Who? <+++++> Come on.
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so. <+++++> No. I'm getting used to it.
Like what? <+++++> Oh...I'll think of something.
What do you know about me? <+++++> I know that you used to work with an architect.
... Not at all. <+++++> You sure?
Christ...no time... <+++++> There never is.
Then I'm free to go...? <+++++> Is anything wrong?
Of birds? <+++++> Certainly, of birds.
I think it looks good. <+++++> I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
Premeditated murder. <+++++> Oh.
Deranged. <+++++> Demented.
It's bad. <+++++> Worse than Warsaw.
They stand around and they argue about drainage - I'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, I've been through it, I know. <+++++> Well, you've been through it. You know. You could make things easier for me.
Stop him! Stop that man! <+++++> Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
Go away -- please. <+++++> That's right -- you go back to sleep. Tomorrow when you feel better things will look a whole lot different.
I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition. <+++++> What kind of condition are you referring to?
Josephine. <+++++> Oh, I didn't hear you come in.
Just like old times. <+++++> Yeah. Old times.
<u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional. <+++++> You want to do this yourself? I don't have to do this, you know.
Grow up, stop being such a baby. Other people get through a lot worse. <+++++> Yeah, sure, what?
What are you doing? <+++++> I think I'm floating.
Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog? Just anything at all? Any little thing? <+++++> No. Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.
Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning? <+++++> I was just talking a walk. I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them. I hate my life.
But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it. <+++++> Let's look anyway.
I was never much of a sweater. You know that. <+++++> Look, Vi, I don't blame you. You feel You feel pity now. The pleasure isn't there any more.
Why is he worried? <+++++> 
Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States. <+++++> I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
Everybody say, "Bye, house." <+++++> Bye, house.
Not particularly. <+++++> Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi.
We're within range, sir. <+++++> Beam them directly to Sickbay.
What happened? <+++++> Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket!
You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety. <+++++> So I've heard.
I'm through improvising. <+++++> Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
Could I talk to you for a second? <+++++> Hey, I'm, you know --
Bet! <+++++> Bet you ass...
Yes, I'm afraid I have. <+++++> What are they like? What are they about?
You wish to close this account today? <+++++> That's correct.
Cry-baby? <+++++> That's what I said.
...Nah, that ain't right... I'm thinkin' of... <+++++> ...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken - see, we've been away for several years, uh...
What do you want? <+++++> Come with me and I'll let her live.
Claire... <+++++> Get out of my way.
No. He won't come after me. <+++++> Why not?
I have my eyes open. <+++++> You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
I'm declining this case. I want us reassigned. <+++++> Whoa, whoa... what? !
I don't know! <+++++> What she say. What'd you get out of her?
He really loves you. Come back to Peking with me. We'll find a solution. <+++++> Where is he now?
The possibility alone is worth ten million. Baggage car, rack 3. Silver briefcase. Combination 314. <+++++> What about Job?
When will his trial be? <+++++> Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
What's wrong with approval? You admired that man. <+++++> Yes.
I'll be around to check up on you. <+++++> Why would you be there?
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota. Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win. <+++++> My ass.
Are you all right? <+++++> Yes... You woke me up... ItÂs the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
-- took a bus. <+++++> -- c'mon, I'll get you home...
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony. <+++++> We were?
I don't know shit about you. <+++++> He was one of the original founders of 'Le Hermanidad' in the days when it represented good not evil.
Yeah. Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski. <+++++> You're not dealing with morons here.
What's your record at? <+++++> 5-5-1.
God, what a bunch of retards... <+++++> I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
Just tell me, did you talk with him? <+++++> He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
Pheasant. <+++++> You Scots have a way with game. It still has life in it. Spirit. Back home the food is so...domestic.
Would you grab my shampoo? <+++++> Shampoo, got it!
Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit. <+++++> Keaton was a piece of shit.

Howya do, Rebecca. I sorta been expectin' you this mornin'. <+++++> I wanta see Nathan.
That's because I'm working. You remember that? You used to care about your work. <+++++> I care more about my life. And yours.
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends. <+++++> You don't want the extra police pay?
Let me go for fuck's sake, Dil -- or they'll be here <+++++> Let them come then.
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp. <+++++> A fellow sees a fire go out all of a sudden, he don't take chances. My name's Clayton and I'm looking for someone.
...the best way one can, you know. <+++++> What's the name of this girl?
What? ! <+++++> You want a convertible or hardtop?
Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too. <+++++> Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --
Well, if it's as serious as all thatÂwe'll move heaven and earth toÂ <+++++> It'll do no good. He despises me.
But my money. All I have here is four dollars. I've got to get to New York with it. <+++++> You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.
What's going on? "Guilty"! What is this? <+++++> I got your bail continued.
As much as ever. Nothing. <+++++> It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here. <+++++> That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here.
Sheila fills a cup. Buzz lifts it to his mouth, his hands trembling. <+++++> You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot.
Do you think he singled you out? <+++++> No, just coincidence. He knew who I was, of course. He had my ID -- did he keep it?
108 and still active? <+++++> You're startled?
This gonna take long? <+++++> Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?
You okay? <+++++> Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
You've either got it or you don't. Let your conscience be your guide? <+++++> Something like that.
What else? <+++++> Nothing else.
You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there. So basically you've spent half your life in prison. <+++++> Basically. Yeah. If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just -- <+++++> I'm trying to be your friend.
Did -- did you -- <+++++> It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
Soda. You got any soda? <+++++> Hablar slowly, por favor. My ingles no es bien.
Yeah, I guess you're right. It's just...all so sudden... <+++++> Yeah, it is...
You're naked. <+++++> It's my house.
But -- there's so much more to do right here. And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone. <+++++> Indeed. After how long? A few weeks? I have been here thirty years. And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
I don't believe that you kissed no girls. That you got three girls and that you faithful and this and that. <+++++> I did.
Does that distress you? <+++++> Not particularly.
So what do you think? <+++++> Sign me up.
No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap. <+++++> I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him? That doctor says the brain is coming around.
Yeah? <+++++> He must have that shit troughed.
I... I think I understand. I think I get it... <+++++> No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
...-mand out of Fort Bragg. <+++++> We were called in by the Jerome base...
Modern Homicide Investigation. In Cold Blood. Of Human Bondage. Human Bondage? <+++++> It's not what you think it is.
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck - <+++++> Quiet!
But I haven't . . . <+++++> I don't want to hear any more about it. If you don't get married, I'll fire both of you.
Isn't that marvelous? <+++++> Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question.
We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute-- <+++++> Lissen, I heard that before--
Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out! <+++++> What happened?
Have I died? <+++++> Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
You bastards! <+++++> What did you do to him! ?
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy. <+++++> Are you sure?
You're not going! You have to stay with us! <+++++> How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power? A month? Half a year?
Swear it, Ethan?...Given word? <+++++> Told ya, didn't I?
Is there anything else you can tell me? Anything about him or her? Doesn't matter how small? <+++++> No. Except he smoked. Like you.
She wants it to come. <+++++> Yes and so do I, but there are too few of us here to carry it. TOO - HEAVY
You're late! <+++++> We're here.
What?!! Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us? ! <+++++> You guys do all the odd jobs.
It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe. <+++++> I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark.
Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking. <+++++> What do you expect? I'm your attorney. You owe me five bucks. I want it now.
