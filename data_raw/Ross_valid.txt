G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?! <+++++> Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose.
That proposal, at the planetarium <+++++> I know, I know it was stupid.
Joey, do you have a minute? <+++++> Dude, what am I gonna
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer... <+++++> Okay, it's not a contest.
It's throwing and catching! <+++++> All right.
Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you. <+++++> Oh, now you can exchange them if you want, ok.
What? <+++++> I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and and certainly passionate, but don't you think it's better if we just stayed friends?
What? <+++++> My foot is stuck in the pocket.
No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor. <+++++> Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.
Do you not want to be seen with me? <+++++> What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?
Oh! I'm sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton? <+++++> Veto. Stewart?
Oh! You know, I just... couple of things I tried ... I just sang a little doo... Itsy Bitsy Spider... <+++++> You sang Baby Got Back didn't you?
I still can 't believe it! I'm the luckiest guy in the world! <+++++> Really?
Honestly! Ross, this isn 't just some girl you picked up in a bar and humped. A child should have a family. <+++++> Mom, y 'know what? I-I can't deal with this right now. I'm sorry
We've got a cab waiting downstairs. <+++++> Well, this was fun. Uh, we should really do it again sometime, wha'dya say? Ok. Alright so I've got him.
Uhh, uh... <+++++> Answer faster, answer faster!
Still going through that dry spell with Carol? <+++++> Yeah.
You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying,  "Rachel!" <+++++> Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
Oh my God! Did you talk to him? <+++++> Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?
Hey, you don 't have to smile. You just have to dance. <+++++> Look, I don 't feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?
No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge. <+++++> Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything. <+++++> I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
So what are they doing? <+++++> I don 't know, something girlie.
Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman. <+++++> Hmph.
Whoa! What?! Why?! <+++++> Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn 't the play still going. <+++++> Let go! Let go!
Why don 't you go up on stage. I'll get a picture of you doing the speech. <+++++> Okay. Okay!
You didn 't tell anybody I was did you?! <+++++> No!  I 'll be right back.
Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going. <+++++> I am sorry, Chandler.
I said I didn 't technically. <+++++> Okay let 's put aside that you  "accidentally" picked up my grandmothers ring and you  "accidentally" proposed to Rachel.
I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen. <+++++> Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
I 'm going for a walk. <+++++> Good morning. Nice breasts by the way.
So, as Joey 's friends, is there anything that you guys think our readers ought to know? <+++++> Uh no, no just-just that he is a great guy.
Okay. Just give us a second. Ross! <+++++> Yeah?
Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn't look so bright. <+++++> Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
All right, give it back to me.  5 of hearts. <+++++> Real magic does exist.
Okay. <+++++> Okay.  Ben? Come here. All right, I 'm gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?
Yeah? <+++++> Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I 'll help you out.
OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up. <+++++> Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it.
What? Wait, what? <+++++> Why don 't you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?
I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you. <+++++> Okay.
Lights please? And that's having a baby. Next week is our final class. <+++++> Susan, go deep.
Personal thing? What personal thing? I don 't know. <+++++> About about sex?  That I hadn't had sex in months?
I didn 't uh, really have time to read this part of the books, but do you think we have time to <+++++> Not so much.
Where have you been? <+++++> Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?
Yeah. <+++++> Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?
Hi honey. <+++++> Oh you guys are not gonna believe what happened.
Hey! It 's starting to snow. <+++++> Gimme the this!
Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening. <+++++> Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just...
Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp. <+++++> Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?
Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross 's points! <+++++> What?!
Well, I don 't care about the divorces either, but I wouldn't date him. It's just that he's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl. <+++++> What?!
Okay. <+++++> Come on.  All right, here we go. All right?
Well, this is awkward. {See? I told you so.} <+++++> But I-I was going to see if y 'know, maybe you uh, start dating again but that-I mean that-that was all, Rach.
Whoooaa! <+++++> That's my sister.
No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies. <+++++> You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
Yeah... <+++++> ... And you called him Alby!?  I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...
Oh. <+++++> Oh my God!
Yeah, I know. <+++++> Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.
Well, it 's just y'know that something like this would never to like The Hulk, y'know <+++++> Actually that-that 's not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found  Y 'know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend's a lesbian.
Oh, I like Elizabeth. <+++++> Well thanks!
Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle. <+++++> Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from. <+++++> OK, now I'm nervous.
Then what's gonna happen? <+++++> Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.
You can totally tell! Here look, watch me.  Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown.  Smile! <+++++> Well, I guess that's it.
Uh Look Rach  Hey Ross is here! Hey look! It's my good friend Ross. Hey Ross. <+++++> Hey Joey.  Hey you.
Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now. <+++++> I can't believe that didn't work!
Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish. <+++++> You are? Me, too!
I don 't want you to date her! <+++++> Why? What, what are you jealous?
It 's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right? <+++++> But hey, it 's not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.
No actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas. <+++++> Gas? Wow! Intense.
Oh yeah. That 's a great story. <+++++> Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium. That 's-that's where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower
Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt. <+++++> Damnit!
Phoebe, if this guy 's going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him? <+++++> Hey, divorced men are not bad men!
Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious. <+++++> G'night.
Carol, not me. <+++++> Err, right.
I bet you did! <+++++> Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?
I have an audition for this play and for some of it I have to speak French. Which, according to my resume, I'm fluent in. <+++++> Joey, you shouldn't lie on your resume.
That's not how you really feel is it? <+++++> No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but I can't help it. I love marriage.
Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs! <+++++> Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
Really? <+++++> No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!
How are you? <+++++> Good.
Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us, right? <+++++> Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress.
Hi. <+++++> Just uh, brought back your videos.
Well why not you changed Ned 's grade! <+++++> Well that 's different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me!
So, except for the fermentation process, beer and ale are basically the same thing. Fascinating isn't it. <+++++> Maybe you should look up "fascinating."
I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash.  So-so what I am saying is - is is that  is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles! <+++++> Oh, that's not what you want...
Monica. <+++++> Mon.
Well, I just caught the live show. <+++++> Eww.
What?! <+++++> Hey, here 's a thought.
Hello. <+++++> Hey, honey.
What? <+++++> Um... uh.... vulva.
Yeah! I 'm just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends. <+++++> Okay. Cool.
You are mad! <+++++> No! No! I 'm not! It's-it's-it's perfect! I mean it's better than you just-just moving here, 'cause it's us together forever, and that's-that's what I want.
Nothing, I don 't know. <+++++> What happened?
Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me? <+++++> No, I stayed at Julie's last night.
Phoebe! We 're both  your backup?! <+++++> Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!
Six? You want me to join you? <+++++> Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good.  Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow.
And slept with the professor. <+++++> I 'm gonna call her.
But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that. <+++++> Ok fine.
It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things. <+++++> No, no, that-that, that 's all right. Umm, I'm just glad you called.
What? <+++++> They gave him a lot of medication, ok? He wouldn't even know if you were there. Look, we'll go see him first thing in the morning, ok?
Ross, what is taking you so long? <+++++> I'm sorry, it's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway!
W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... <+++++> Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.
Great! All right. I 'll see you later. <+++++> Hey, where 's Chandler?
Okay, well can 't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me? <+++++> Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we 're never gonna get along.
Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags! <+++++> Huh, didn 't see that coming.
Am I going to let you watch me undress? <+++++> No!
Really? <+++++> No!
Yeah, all right. <+++++> Okay.
What? <+++++> All I have to do is close my eyes. See?  Woo-hoo!!
Who 's number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play. <+++++> Uh, no, it 's-it's just this person.
Who are these men? <+++++> Men. I guy I know.
Look, I 'm fine. Watch.  Look at that.  Whoa-whoa! <+++++> Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a doctor! Okay?
Check. <+++++> I'm in for fifty cents.
Not that big a deal? There there was touching of things. <+++++> Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?
Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on? <+++++> Mine.
Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is  gay. <+++++> She is not  She 's gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can 't believe this.
No. <+++++> You 'll see.
Don't you just love it? <+++++> Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.
We're kidding. C'mon, tell us! <+++++> Yeah! C'mon!
Oh my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pajmena could be a rug! <+++++> Oh yeah, how about you and the,   "I'm sorry!"
No. <+++++> You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?
I'm going commando, too. <+++++> Awwww!!!
We love you, man. <+++++> Funny, my birthday was seven months ago.
Oh wow, this feels weird. <+++++> Good weird?
Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings? <+++++> I'll take sports.
Huh, I might be losing interest in this. <+++++> Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybe kinda wanted ah start things up again.
Do I look fat? <+++++> Noo.
In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepard. <+++++> Woah.
Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope! <+++++> I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
Okay everyone, think thick. <+++++> Good-bye! Good luck!
Kyle 's ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date her! <+++++> Hi! I 'm sorry, but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night.
The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya? <+++++> That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.
Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky. <+++++> We'll give you Janice.
Wait up! <+++++> Hey-hey, since you 're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?
What 's happening to your accent? <+++++> Come again? What 's-what's this nonsense?   All right, I'm-I'm not English. I'm from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I'm sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions?  About paleontology.  All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I'm-I'm hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression
Okay, the next situation is for Rachel. The wedding is about to start you walk into the back room and you find Monica taking a nap with Ross.  I 'll be Monica. Go! <+++++> No! No! No!

Ahh, nooo!! <+++++> Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could,  'cause that's not where you want to skimp.
All right! <+++++> I would!
Oh my God. <+++++> I -They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
Or we could throw you both in now! <+++++> Ok, gentlemen! Please! Aren't we a little old for this? I mean, we're scientists, right? We're academics. And most importantly I... you- you will have to catch us first. . GO, GO, GO!

I don 't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black. <+++++> What?
That thing is not coming in here. <+++++> 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?
No, so I don 't have to get married until I'm 33! That's three years, that's three whole years-Oh, wait a minute though. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty. <+++++> Which is fine! Because you just turned --twenty-eight!
Give it! <+++++> Hello?  No she can 't come to the phone right now.  Oh, right no problem. Okay, bye-bye.

Noo! Maybe! I, I don 't know. Ross, I still can't forgive you for what you did, I can't, I just, but sometimes when I'm with you I just, I feel so... <+++++> What?!
Oh, here is your beautiful baby. Congratulations! <+++++> I hope you 're a better father than you're a friend!!
131! <+++++> Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And remember, you're daddy's little girl...  Phoebe's totally ruined that for me...

Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this. <+++++> Eh, no problem.
Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy. <+++++> Come on, Pheebs lay off him.
You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush. I'm just saying, it's right there. <+++++> Hey guys.
Right and then everybody finds out and they're like <+++++> I know! It's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? I mean, call, or leave a note
Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug! <+++++> It 's also a sign of friendship.
Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that 's not happening 'til October 15th, 2032. <+++++> That 's the day you're gonna die? See-darnit, I've got shuffleboard that day.
You don't think we should wait for him? <+++++> You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok?
Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her? <+++++> Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross? <+++++> That 's true, thanks dad.  People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!!

Monica. <+++++> Mon.
Yeah! That was so weird, huh? <+++++> Phoebe, why 'd you do it?
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work? <+++++> I have no idea. I mean But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
Okay. <+++++> Break!!
You're blowin' me off for a monkey? <+++++> Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday.
I want to do it again. <+++++> We can 't do it again.
Sure, it 's hard to forget! But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about. <+++++> What the hell happened on that beach?!
Come on Ross! I 'm miserable here! Come on! You started this, now you finish it! Come on wuss, make love to me. <+++++> Y 'know what?
Oh, give it to me. <+++++> I got it!
You slept with another woman? <+++++> Oh, you-you 're-you're one to talk.
Hope you had a nice flight. <+++++> Ohh, it was the best!
Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won 't get spit in the eyes, y'know? <+++++> And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!
Happy New Year. <+++++> Happy New Year, Pheebs!
Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment? <+++++> Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!
Well, I feel fine, but I think you 're bumming out the rest of the kids. <+++++> What?
Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in. <+++++> Go away! I don't want to see anybody.
We 're beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink.... <+++++> I 'm really glad we came.  You're so pretty. I love you.
Hey! <+++++> Are you kidding?
There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely! <+++++> Okay, so what 's the matter?
Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has -yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates. <+++++> Oh. Yeah?
Uh, I think she's still asleep. Hey, hey, how did it go with you guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you. <+++++> Uh, we, y'know, we worked things out.
Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash. <+++++> What?
Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts. <+++++> I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?
Okay, let 's do it. I'll move in. <+++++> Really?
Oh, hey, don 't forget your shirt. <+++++> Oh, thanks!
Yes, she jumped right back up. <+++++> Oh my God, Phoebe, slow down!
Look, it 's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you. <+++++> When I got married you slept with my sister.
Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff. <+++++> Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?
It's my joke. <+++++> Y 'know, I don't think we're going to settle this.
Ross, there is absolutely no way this is going to come off unless you start to <+++++> Ow!!
No. He.....he 's coming out of his shorts. <+++++> What?!
Not even with your best friend. <+++++> Noo!
What?! Are you kidding?! <+++++> Of course I am!  Okay, let's go godfather.
No, yeah, I've done that. <+++++> And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.
I 'll be back in ten minutes. <+++++> Okay.
Oh no, wait! Joey! <+++++> 73! 72! 71!
That could be it. <+++++> Oh, god.  You know, this is still pretty hot.
Yeah. <+++++> All right, I'll see you guys later.
I got a gig! <+++++> Yay!!
Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist... <+++++> Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
Wow. Ok. <+++++> I'll see you in the morning .
Yeah. <+++++> You know, I, I used to, ah, play keyboards in college.
Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality. <+++++> Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
Well, what did the police say? <+++++> My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!
Um, everyone? <+++++> Oh, you're right, I'm sorry.
Ross! Can I talk to you for a second? <+++++> Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can 't? Okay.
Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here! <+++++> No!!
Ohhhh! These seats are great! <+++++> I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice  I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!
Nobody. <+++++> Is that Mark?
Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me! <+++++> What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here! <+++++> No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that.
What?! You 're going out with her again! <+++++> Going out with who?
Hello? Yeah, um. Hang on one sec.  <to Ross and Rachel> Can I take this upstairs? <+++++> Sure, we don't live there but...
What!? They are totally ripping us off! <+++++> Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six!
Is your back feeling better? <+++++> Oh yeah it 's fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.
Okay, we owe you a present. <+++++> Two! I 've been engaged twice!
Sure, May...tember. <+++++> October 18th.
All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me? <+++++> I am!
Monica 's gotta have the phone in the right place and- <+++++> All right! All right! All right!  We are fixing it.
Sort of. <+++++> Really?!
Wow that 's actually pretty cool. <+++++> Oh umm, there 's also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina.  What is that?
All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then. <+++++> Chandler!
Sandy, that's exactly what it is... <+++++> Are you gay?
So, anyone up for a midnight dip in the ocean? <+++++> Ahh, no, I 'm good.
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but I 'm okay. <+++++> Yeah?
Oh God, Ross I am so sorry. <+++++> Yeah, well.
I know, I know. I went a little crazy. <+++++> A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!
Fine! Do you want something to drink? <+++++> Sure, what do you got?
You are never going to believe what happened to me today. <+++++> What?
No, I don't mind you touching my belly, but right now your hand is kind of blocking the part where the baby is gonna come out. <+++++> Hey!
And also, congratulations on your wedding. <+++++> Wha -What?
Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going? <+++++> Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
Well... there is just one small... stipulation... <+++++> I have to break up with Charlie?
What uh-oh? <+++++> Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing.  Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
Sure, he was in your "band"? <+++++> It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
Yeah, I 've been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my Grandma's. <+++++> Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes -Do-do you want to make out?
Grape. <+++++> 
Goodnight. <+++++> Mmm.  Oh, no-
Oh, we 're not together. <+++++> Oh no-no-no, we 're just two people who happen to run into each other here at the coffee house.
Nice! <+++++> No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can't put them back on. I can't!
Okay, here we go. <+++++> All right everyone, lift!  And slide!!
How come?! <+++++> Apparently, Sting 's son made fun of the fact that Ben's moms are lesbinims.
Ross? Ross? <+++++> Elizabeth!  Okay. Okay.  I 'm gonna go out this window.  I'll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you're going home, okay?
And, and! <+++++> Ahhhh!!
Besides tampons and salt?  Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you.  That's weird...it's empty! <+++++> Hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...?  do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?
Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there. <+++++> Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--
Thank you. <+++++> Hey, what do you say we celebrate? Champagne?
Apology accepted. <+++++> Okay. So we're, we're good?
Well it 's kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he's not real. <+++++> Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!
No, I don 't see it! <+++++> Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this?  This tiny thing that looks like a peanut?
Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast here. Thank you.  I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel... <+++++> What?!
Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me! <+++++> All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number!  And not the one on the menu!
No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing- there team. <+++++> Come on, two on one.
Oh Ross you 're so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax <+++++> What-what are you doing?! Are you -Okay that's not funny! Just stop horsing around!
Sure! <+++++> I'd love to!
What?! <+++++> Joey 's asking if you've just ruined the first book he's ever loved that didn't star Jack Nicholson?
Nah. Not really. <+++++> You don't believe in evolution?
Hey! <+++++> What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes??
Oohhh. <+++++> Hi.
That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl. <+++++> Yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread.
Come on! <+++++> 30 seconds on the clock. 5 questions wins the game. The lightning round begins now! What is Joey's favorite food?
You guys okay? <+++++> I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...
Yeah well we should order some food then. <+++++> No Joey! Look why don 't, why don't we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we'll each go out with her one more time. And-and we 'll see who she likes best.
Hey, check this out! It's totally you! <+++++> Wow!
Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!! <+++++> That 's a duck.
He carries a briefcase. <+++++> 10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
Hello? <+++++> Uh, never mind, I don't want to know.
We hate that guy. <+++++> Yeah. Hate him.
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements. <+++++> Oh great! What, you brought Joey?
Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. <+++++> I do have a newfound respect for life.
What in God 's name is that?! <+++++> Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven 't seen that since the forth grade!
No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her. <+++++> Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one time -not any more. I just-I...
Oh, I really could. <+++++> Oh!
Touchdown!! Touchdown!! <+++++> Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn 't count.
Uh, I'm holding Ben. <+++++> Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb.
...I really don't... <+++++> Can I talk to you for a minute?
Okay! <+++++> Emily?!
Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure I can have caffeine. <+++++> I went thru this with Ben and Carol. One cup of coffee won't affect your milk.
Why? <+++++> Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.
All right, that's it. I want both of you out. <+++++> Why?
Oh my god. <+++++> 
No! <+++++> At least tell me where you hid it.
Dr. Wiener. <+++++> Rach, you can't call people at three in the morning.
Oh man! Now she 's gonna start all over! We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world! <+++++> No, no, we will. We just won 't tell her she messed up.
How hot are we? <+++++> You wanna buy a car?
Ooh, are you gonna do magic? <+++++> That's, that's funny. Change!
Sure, I 'll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing. <+++++> Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?
You mean your pink shirt? <+++++> Faded salmon color.
How about a hammer, or a small blade? <+++++> Why- why- why would he need a blade?
Excuse me, where are you going? <+++++> Uh... to the bathroom.
Oh yeah! What was his superpower again? <+++++> A superhuman thirst for knowledge.
Oh well, well thank you.  Okay, stop. Stop looking at me like that. The last time that happened,  that happened. <+++++> Oh right, right.  So, are you . . . ah . . . you excited about your, your first night away from Emma?
Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl. <+++++> I can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today.
But somehow you came off as the bad guy. <+++++> What?!
Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle. <+++++> Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket. <+++++> Okay I put most of the stuff away.
Yeah, I-I think I suggested that. <+++++> Aw, we-we are so  So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y'know hanging out with you. And I mean-I'm having a lot of fun.
Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier. <+++++> Hey, Phoebs, how'd it go.
Oh, yeah. <+++++> You comin'?
Well, it's good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius. <+++++> The volcano?
Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody 's sale is over?! <+++++> Hey.
Thanks for dinner last night. <+++++> Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.
Right. <+++++> Sweep, sweep....
Bread, so you never go hungry. <+++++> Ohh.
Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days. <+++++> Listen Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about this.
Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite... <+++++> What?
What does he look like? <+++++> Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell-o.
Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo. <+++++> Knock-knock.
Hi... <+++++> You know where Joey is?
Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life! <+++++> Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental
That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops! <+++++> Fine.
And I also got... two more apples. <+++++> We are four short of a bush-o . God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!
What are you, what are you doin'? <+++++> Oh, oh my God, is this the wrong day? I don't believe it, uh, well, hey, I guess if it works out we'll, we'll have something to tell the grandkids.
Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me. <+++++> So, you 're not going to Paris.
Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on! <+++++> That is gonna hurt tomorrow!
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much? <+++++> Come on, it's fun!
You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just... <+++++> What?  Great, now I'm having a baby.
Damn it! Rookie mistake! <+++++> I have sex with dinosaurs??
That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up. <+++++> What?
Why not?! <+++++> Bec -Did you not hear me?! She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They're wild! Why do you want to come anyway?
Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here? <+++++> Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already. <+++++> Yeah, I 'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good.   Yes!!   Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not. <+++++> Hey Rach!
I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here. <+++++> Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody.
You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me. <+++++> Oh, I'm threatened by you?
That won 't be necessary. <+++++> And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
What thing? What thing? <+++++> Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on.  Easy.
Do you think we 'll get our three bucks back? <+++++> Hey!
Okay, y 'know maybe I should come back <+++++> Shh! Shh! Shh!
Wow, what-what do you think she wants? <+++++> Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.
Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem. <+++++> Look, if you don't know what the word  "acrimonious" means, just don't use it!
Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita? <+++++> Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!
Didn 't she walk with a cane? <+++++> Only when it was damp!!  I can 't believe you-you told people about this?! Everybody knew?! Y'know what?  I'm back in the club!
Nothing!   This is not over! <+++++> No! No! No!
Bye hon. <+++++> Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.
Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that. <+++++> Fascinating.
Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster 's Dictionary defines marriage as  Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old. <+++++> Oh! That 's nice.
Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table. <+++++> I love it, when we share.
Why not? <+++++> Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn 't find out some other way.  Did you think about the trail? <+++++> What trail?
Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife! <+++++> Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?
Ross and Rachel's apartment. Mike is blowing a note from his beer bottle. Ross stares off to the side.) <+++++> Shouldn't the pizza be here by now? I mean, they said thirty minutes or less. Well, how long has it been?
Absolutely. <+++++> Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I don't want to infect him.
Umm, our situation. Y 'know umm, what we mean to each other. And I mean we-we're having this baby together, and we live together. Isn't that, isn't that weird? <+++++> Well uh
I can't believe you did that. <+++++> Yeah, well.
Of course you did. Look Ross, you can 't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there. <+++++> Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel?  I will think about the therapy.
Come here, I'll make you a drink. <+++++> Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
Look; you got stood up, who cares? We're gonna show you a good time. Just sit and relax. In fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on the house. <+++++> Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to have sex tonight.
Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room. <+++++> Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn 't about the room, this is about what the room represents! And unfortunately, this room  could destroy you!!
I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy... <+++++> Get out!
You put your balloons down!! <+++++> Everybody put their balloons down!!!  Now this is a nice suit!!
Honey, it isn 't good luck. <+++++> Oh my God! Monica!
Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean... <+++++> Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.
GIVE ME MY PUCK!! <+++++> ...Now that was fun.
But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she 'd know I was okay. <+++++> Dude.
Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive. <+++++> So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises! <+++++> I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.
So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale. <+++++> Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that one -Dude! They're all huge! <+++++> They don 't look any bigger than me!
Yeah, did I fool ya? <+++++> Totally!
Ok. <+++++> Here we go!
What's up with the simian? <+++++> It's just a fur ball.
Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample. <+++++> So-so what did the doctor say?
Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him. <+++++> Really?
No, it's okay, you didn't know. <+++++> Oh...  Little heads-up would have been nice.
How cute was that? <+++++> Oh-oh, were you, were you watching?
Small... <+++++> Small...
Oh, my, oh! <+++++> What? What's wrong?
So, tell me about it. <+++++> Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.
Yes, and she's very supportive. <+++++> Okay, that's great.  No, I'm- Oh.
Fine! Two minutes. Go. <+++++> This is -you-
The hot chicks? <+++++> Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y 'know-y'know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It's here! Yeah, it's right-it's right down here! In the biggest library in the university!
Ross, don 't start. <+++++> Come on, you-you can 't tell me you actually believe that-that there's a woman inside that cat!
Dude, are you okay? <+++++> Totally.
Hi. <+++++> I didn't get a cat.
Yeah! <+++++> Amazing! Amazing!
Yeah. Okay. <+++++> No, come on, he doesn't know this stuff. If he knew how you felt.
Come on, it 's a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn't smoked since. <+++++> Pffhah.
All right! <+++++> Good, you don 't want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you?
Oh wow, I didn't get you anything. Here's five back. <+++++> No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright. Oh, hey, do you think there's a chance you could fix that radiator now?
Hey! <+++++> Hello!
Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe. <+++++> Whoo!
Okay, so this time I won't quit! <+++++> Ohhh! Put it out!
Together. <+++++> Not at the concert.
Yeah, I thought you knew that. <+++++> Umm, no.
All right. I 'm gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I'm ready to have Frank and Alice's embryo transferred into my uterus. <+++++> Now, how will they know if you 're ready?
I am freaking out! <+++++> Are ya?
Yeah, but you're back's a zero. You're gonna wanna even that out. <+++++> Really!
Y 'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame. <+++++> Oh, right!
Okay! Okay!  I 'm so glad you're here. <+++++> Come on.  I got it.
Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o' clock. So I was hoping you and I could have a <+++++> Oh, yeah, yeah that's Michelle.
I got fired. <+++++> Oh!
Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth. <+++++> Yeah.
Ok! <+++++> Wait, wait a minute, there's no light on the back wall! How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello?  Ah, oh, ah!  Ah!  The same thing happened again!
I'm pretty sure, professor Spafford from Cornell? <+++++> Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is  "if you can't come on time, then don't come at all".  An option that many of my students use.  Shall we?
We heard you play all the way from your apartment! <+++++> Were you the ones called the cops?!
Here we go! <+++++> Oh! Oh! She 's upside down but she's coming! She's coming!
And, a lemon lime. <+++++> Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.
Funny book? <+++++> Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying  'I'll see you Saturday.'
Damn it! <+++++> Walls are pretty thin, guys!
Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend? <+++++> You remember Janice, right?
Right. No biggie. Stay loose. <+++++> Why do they keep doing that?
But I already told Zelner that I would come back... <+++++> I'm sure he'll understand.
Fun? Fun, you think this is fun? <+++++> Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids.
Me too. <+++++> I guess if everybody else is...
Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! <+++++> Anyway.. um..  So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
Uh-huh. <+++++> We live together. You 're having our baby. I'm not gonna see anybody else. Are you-are you sure you don't want something more?
Uh, how is he at handling small objects? <+++++> He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
Yes? <+++++> Hey! Hey Adrienne.
No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us  We've been complaining the longest! <+++++> No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?
Okay, scarf 's done. <+++++> Come on! Come on. Come on.
What?! <+++++> The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.
Good luck, man. <+++++> Thanks.  OK.
I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go! <+++++> Trying to date this woman.
Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what? <+++++> Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.
Well, maybe he wouldn 't be she didn't bring the office home every night! <+++++> Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
Aw, thanks! <+++++> Okay Phoebe, I guess you 're next  although I really don't see the point.
Hey! How'd the audition go?! <+++++> Not so good.
Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  You'll get your turn! <+++++> Hey Pheebs, what's going on?
Does anyone have one from a different paper? Ross, read yours. <+++++> I don't want to.
Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice. <+++++> Do you uh, do you talk about me?
No. <+++++> Oh. How do you uh, ya know, keep it so neat?
It's a kitchen slash bathroom. <+++++> All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
What? C'mon, talk to me. <+++++> OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex?
I uh, I got it from the gift shop. They have really lax security there.  It 's a joke. <+++++> Bye.
Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross. <+++++> Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!
What about  Monica. <+++++> Hey, you only heard Monica's side of that. That little fatso was a terror.
And I know both of them, they 're really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who's always getting chased by those big flowers <+++++> Oh, I love that guy!
You just carry that around? <+++++> Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.
I got an extra one. You want this? <+++++> No.
It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that! <+++++> Yeah, no one talks like that!
Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you 're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip. <+++++> Hey, you 're right.
Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah. <+++++> You'll never get me, Joe!!!
Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she 's gonna go nuts for you. <+++++> So, you 're saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?
Let me put it this way. We're having sex whether you're here or not. <+++++> Pants off Bing!
'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute. <+++++> Monica, you 're so lucky! He's like the most popular guy in school!!
Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing! <+++++> Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading?  Pheebs?  Hello?  Phoebe?  Phoe-Phoebe!  Come on!
Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there. <+++++> On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.
Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today. <+++++> Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?
Good, you guys are all here! <+++++> Hey! What's up?
He 's holding us back. <+++++> Totally.
Oh, have a great wedding! <+++++> Thanks.
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey. <+++++> Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
She's right y'know. <+++++> Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
would you call this girl?  thanks-fo-r-a- love-ly-even-ing <+++++> now I feel terrible this is all my fault.
I 'm not feeling it. <+++++> I was just outside Barcelona, hiking
And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you. <+++++> Alright you kids, bye now.
Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun? <+++++> Yeah.
Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go! <+++++> He's right, man.
Bye! <+++++> Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.
Hey, hubby! <+++++> Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?
I'm not Drake. <+++++> That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin.
Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea? <+++++> I 've been back and forth.
Rossy, we're ready for you. <+++++> Hmm, yeah.  Come on Ross jr. It's time to go in.
Yeah, don 't push it though. <+++++> I 've got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.
Has it been that long?! <+++++> Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
Ohhhhhhhh God. <+++++> Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?
Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend. <+++++> I am your friend.
Oh, sure!  Bye Ross!  Forever. <+++++> Hi.
Great! <+++++> Smooth man. Yeah, you got some chilie on your neck.  Well, I just want to say, thanks everyone, this- this was great. And hey! See you guys Monday morning.  Thanks Joey.
Yeah. <+++++> Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.
What?! <+++++> Are you serious?
Hi sweetie! Are you leaving? <+++++> Well
It 's true?!! <+++++> No.
Yeah, I 'd really like to. <+++++> Okay, hopefully this time mom won 't boo you.
Ross? You okay? <+++++> They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!
I 'm a commodities broker. <+++++> Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting.
Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something? <+++++> Yeah...
Uh-hmm. <+++++> Wow, I haven 't seen her for like forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes.
I like it. <+++++> Are you kidding?
Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college. <+++++> She seems really , really fun!
Why is Ross doing that? <+++++> DANGER!!!!
We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry. <+++++> This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
Hey. <+++++> Listen, I um I heard about the engagement.
Yeah? Well you still shoulda told me. <+++++> I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel 's father. Look I I made a mistake, but it's only because I really, really like you. Really!
No, wait, you don't have my phone number! <+++++> You know, if it's meant to be, I'll guess it. Bye, bye.
You can 't ask us son, that's cheating. <+++++> You 're right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.
I just can 't decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel? <+++++> Oh what are you kidding? She 's gorgeous, it's all Rachel.
Look, I don't see why I should have to miss out on the coaching training just because I'm a woman. <+++++> I see. So what do you propose to do?
Hurry! <+++++> Okay!
That is neither here nor there. <+++++> Okay, well here we are. Now we 're in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail?  Look, I,  I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I'm sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can't.  I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.
I love your place! Where is this guy from? <+++++> Uh that 's an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.
Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad. <+++++> I-I 'm sorry Rach, I didn't know. Are you gonna be okay?
No, it 's all right. I got nice boobs. <+++++> So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!
Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone. <+++++> Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it. <+++++> Yeah, exactly.
Then, I 'd steer clear of Phoebe. <+++++> Man!
You got another ex-wife back there? <+++++> Please start drinking!
Do you mind telling us what it is? <+++++> Sorry, I 'm kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.
Hey. <+++++> Do you have a minute? I 'd like to talk to you about something I'm, I'm really uncomfortable talking about.
Yeah, sounds like a good idea... Dr. Geller! <+++++> Stop it!
Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!! <+++++> I I don 't know what you are talking about.
Oh, man, I'm sorry. Why? <+++++> Well, with everything that's been going on lately, I haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didn't tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?
You have a son! <+++++> I know. I know.
We love you. Buy. <+++++> Have a good time. Ok, Ben.
Well those are very popular frames. <+++++> Neil Sedaka wears them.
Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work. <+++++> A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a chance!
No, but he did just win the McArthur genius grant. <+++++> Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine?
That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight.  Maybe there's something in that area. <+++++> Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself,  "Wow,  I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."
It 's been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi. <+++++> Oh. Oh, that 's right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn't.
Oh, make it stop! <+++++> Oh no!!
I 'm Andrew, and I didn't pay for this pear. <+++++> Okay, good-good for you.
We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.' <+++++> Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.
You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two? <+++++> I'm so sorry
Oh no, two days, you must be bummed. <+++++> Yeah, she 's got to go back to London. But you know what? I've been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that's it. Y'know.
I'll do it. <+++++> I'll...
and all those dinosaur nick-knacks you have Ross, I thought they might be more at home in the garage. <+++++> Well we we don't have a garage.
Yeah. <+++++> Good-good-good.
Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up? <+++++> No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?
Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn 't you date him? <+++++> And if you wait right here, I 'll go get Ross.
A-alright! I can do this. <+++++> There you go! Good for you! And you know what, I'm actually getting used to this little guy. I don't really even feel him in here anymore.
But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too. <+++++> Who 's your roommate?
Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek. <+++++> Fine by me; hope she wins.
It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keep focusing on Jordie. <+++++> Who the hell is Jordie?
...It's kinda hard though! <+++++> Yeah.
Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat! <+++++> Sorry.
Ross, honey, is there anything we can do? <+++++> Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
Looks like it. <+++++> Y 'know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at
What's a matter with you? <+++++> What's a matter with me? You've got a black light. It's 1999!
Can we come in? <+++++> I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody.
Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me. <+++++> Oh, what? What-what?
Thank you Rachel. <+++++> Bye sweetie.
They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds. <+++++> 59 seconds.  Quartz, ha.
Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing. <+++++> What, uh... what juggling thing?
Y'know what you should do? <+++++> Huh?
yea you know you are a bit of a drama queen. <+++++> but you, your so much better off you just go from guy to guy having fun and never worrying that it terns into anything serious.
Close your accounts? Is there some kind of problem? <+++++> No-no.
For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel! <+++++> Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
No! Listen, I 'm not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can't blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let's just call this, tie score and it's halftime. <+++++> Okay, first of all, I don 't play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!
Hey! <+++++> What?
I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday. <+++++> Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time. <+++++> What are you talking about?
Your folks are really that bad, huh? <+++++> Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.
Yeah, I just don't buy it. <+++++> Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.
Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right? <+++++> No, no, that 's funny. But maybe it's time to move on, let it go, y'know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth's father, so ah, he's much older than she is. Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils, huh?
Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown. I thought you guys might like to come. <+++++> For real?
No that 's just--That's just 'cause I'm such a good messer! <+++++> Rach?
Tommy 's supposed to be here soon, we're going to lunch. <+++++> Look. Look, I wasn 't going to say anything to you, but... All right, I don't think you should be seeing Tommy anymore.
Yeah. I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say,  I am really enjoying Nacho Chair. <+++++> Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.
Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That 's what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top.  Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was. <+++++> I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.
Services?  Oh, services. <+++++> Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right, JUMBO with a U, sir.  No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment.  All rightie, bye bye.
nothing, I'm excited about our date, Mike this is Ross Geller this is Mike Haaaaa <+++++> I'm sorry I didn't catch.
I can 't! <+++++> Hey! Hey! Come on! You can! I know you can do this! Let 's go!
Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can... <+++++> Uhm, I hadn't no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris. Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared.
Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people! <+++++> That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?
You guys, can we please not watch this all right. <+++++> Shhhh!
Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don 't <+++++> I just -y'know-I-I just have one-Rachel?!
Oh no, no, right I shouldn 't have said married. Uh, please don't go freaky on me. I didn't mean it. Well, I didn't say it; I take it back! <+++++> No, no, don 't. Why don't we?
Both of you together? <+++++> Wh-what 's up?
Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker? <+++++> I want to go to the bathroom.
Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones! <+++++> I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key! <+++++> Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh?  Ok!
Shut up. <+++++> 
Yeah. <+++++> All right.
That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice. <+++++> No thank you for Thank you.
Hey! So what show are you on? <+++++> Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology.
You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work. <+++++> And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work.  Now come on!
Ohh, I would love too. <+++++> Yeah? Oh-oh, she 'd be so excited!
Do you wanna get to Rachel in time? <+++++> Yes, but I don't wanna die in your cab!
Oh my God, I gotta go to work! <+++++> Oh sweetie, when do you think you 're going to get off tonight?
 <+++++> My God.
Okay... aahhh... Please laugh for mommy... Please? Please laugh for mommy...  Not funny huh? Oh so, is it... only offensive novelty rap? Or maybe just, you know, rap in general? 'Cause mommy can rap...  My name is mommy and I'm here to say / that all the babies are... Oh, I can't rap... Allright sweetheart... This is only because I love you so much, and I know that you're not gonna tell anybody...  I like... big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... / when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face...  Yes! Yes! Yes! YES! Oohhhhh! Oh!  I like big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... Oh Emma you're laughing! Oh you are, you really do like big butts, don't you. Oh you beautiful little weirdo... <+++++> Hey!
Yeah, okay but look, buy uh -Hey-hey, y'know, y'know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn't get said enough. I like you Ross. <+++++> But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?!
Oh, it 's a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven't done the secret thing in a long time. <+++++> Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn 't propose.
We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old... <+++++> 200 at least.
Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it 's not! <+++++> Okay. So well I 'll umm,  I'll have her home by midnight.
Not knowing when to shut up... <+++++> Yep! That's my thing...
Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up . <+++++> Oh, oh, ok, great. You know what, while you're at it she said another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up
She 's right! You have to stop! <+++++> What? No! No, I 'm not stopping. I'm Red Ross!
Yes it does. <+++++> But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don 't think there's really anything you can do about it.
I said it first, bro. <+++++> Well, I thought it first, Holmes.
Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work. <+++++> Dad, we-we can 't believe you're selling the house.
Thank you. <+++++> No-no, thank you Miranda.
Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle? <+++++> A little bit.
There you go. <+++++> Thank you Gunther. We didn't want to have to go and do that.
Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air.  Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone <+++++> What are you talking about?
So, er... how did it go with Celia? <+++++> Oh, I was unbelievable.
Oh right, because you 're so capable of change. <+++++> Y 'know, he hums when he pees!
Yes! <+++++> A green LeSabre?
Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London. <+++++> This is not good for my rage.
Bye! <+++++> Bye!
What?! <+++++> C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!
Yeah!   Are you kiddin'? <+++++> Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on!
You make me laugh. <+++++> Hmm-Hmm.
Nice to see you. <+++++> Yeah! yeah, I got tenure!
has your girlfriend got the butt? <+++++> Hell yeah!
Hey, what 's the horsepower on this thing? <+++++> I don 't know, but-but look how shiny!
Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date! <+++++> But I'm not! . You know what if you're in the mood for Thai food...
Gimme an  'I!' <+++++> I!
That was you? <+++++> They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it.
So who else was in this club? <+++++> Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but I-I don 't think he-he knew what it was.
That is so sweet, you guys. <+++++> Hey, Mon.
Ross, I thought you were over this. <+++++> Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.
Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face? <+++++> Yeah.
Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man. <+++++> Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!
Why not? <+++++> Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!
Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least one of your weddings . See now, tonight, all I <+++++> Marenge,
I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you. <+++++> She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
Ross, it just wouldn 't have been feasible. <+++++> But having a dove place the ring on your finger would 've been no problem?
Center ice. <+++++> Did I do something to you?
Y'don't think that makes me seem a little... <+++++> ...desperate, needy, pathetic?
Ross, you don't seem okay. <+++++> I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining. I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.
Oh, well I tell Issac everything. <+++++> You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven 't actually met...
Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here. <+++++> Yeah, no problem.
Hi! <+++++> Hey.
Yeah. The  '92 Ross wouldn't. <+++++> Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.
Yeah, it would be really weird. <+++++> Good luck.
I know! <+++++> Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked! <+++++> Nono, that would be me again.
Well neither do I! <+++++> Is this about Mark?
You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were.... <+++++> La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it 's, I mean it's you.
So what does this mean? <+++++> I'm gonna have to give him up.
Princess Leia in the gold bikini. <+++++> Yes!
Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I 'm gonna break up with you! <+++++> Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,   "If you accept full responsibility..."  Full responsibility! "...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do.  Does it?!!"
Wow, what? <+++++> It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.' <+++++> C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
I love Mark.  Do you know Mark? <+++++> Yeah!!
Okay, umm, I 'm gonna get my sweater. <+++++> Okay.  You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger. <+++++> Huuh.
Well, she 's out of town so, there's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is. <+++++> Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
I 'm sorry! <+++++> Ooh. What is the name of Chandler 's father's Las Vegas all-male burlesque?
Alright, now you say something. <+++++> I... ahem... I really don't think so.
Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk. <+++++> Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can 't just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You're gonna get peep eye! <+++++> I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she 'd say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!
I just saw Janice. <+++++> Oh.
What?! Are you crazy? <+++++> Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
Right. Was it the,  "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?" <+++++> Anyway, if she, if she wasn 't in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?
Yeah, me neither. Yet <+++++> Uhhhhhh that-that may be weird.
Oh my God! <+++++> Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!
After a while it's like, shut your mouth, you know? <+++++> Hmm-Hmm.
Um-hum, you're jealous. <+++++> Of... of what?
Oh my God! What were you doing in a library? <+++++> Pheebs, what about you?
Look at that! <+++++> How weird is that? Y 'know? You're moving in with me and have the one thing I don 't have. It's like uh, in a way you-you complete me  kitchen.
Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on. <+++++> What??
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things? <+++++> No.
Do you want any help? <+++++> You come out there, you're a dead man.
So, what do you think? <+++++> About what?
"When can you move in?" <+++++> Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it 's against my oath as a masseuse. <+++++> They make you take an oath?
What, the blonde with no bra? <+++++> She was blonde?  Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years.
Cute. <+++++> I got some, uh, hers and hers towels for Susan and Carol. And, uh, I got this blouse for mom.
No, absolutely. Y 'know like it was umm <+++++> Surely you can think of something good.
I can 't believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is this crumb.  I wish you a long and happy marriage. <+++++> Hey.
I'd say that chair's taking the brunt. <+++++> Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?
Thanks. <+++++> Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!
Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane. <+++++> Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.
Petty... <+++++> Petty...
I 'm not trying to pull anything. Look I love you dude. <+++++> Y 'know what? I-I'm not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay --Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me feel Ned?! You used me! You don't love me and you never did!  Ah Professor Winston, Professor Fredrickson, I'll be right with you.  Don't make this worse and I'll give you a C.  Shall we?
So, let's go. <+++++> Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in. <+++++> 
I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park. <+++++> Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
Oh my! <+++++> Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!
Uh why, do you have a lecture? <+++++> No, why?
Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island? <+++++> Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.
Welcome to the building. I'm uh, Steve Sarah; I'm president of the tenants committee. <+++++> Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.
Shall we? <+++++> Yeah.
I know I do. <+++++> Hi.
Alright, what are we gonna say? <+++++> Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!
Wait a minute, why don 't you just call Mark.  I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen. <+++++> But, you, you don 't want to seem too pushy.
Come on! you... <+++++> No!
Ah yeah, but now it 's Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home. <+++++> Where 's Ben?
And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century. <+++++> Yeah, that's it?
And, a lemon lime. <+++++> Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.
You think?! <+++++> All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.
Uhh, I can 't. <+++++> Oh, you have some studying to do?
hey wait wait wait wait wait! Is that true what you said Phoebe's never had a serious relationship? <+++++> of course she has. if she'd never had a serious relationship I'd go round broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron.
Mm-hmm. <+++++> Wh- are you welling up?
Okay. <+++++> Come on, Chandler.
What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn 't, and if you have to even think about it... <+++++> No, Rach, no. I don 't, I don't, I don't have to think about it, in fact, I 've decided, I've decided that, that it.......does.
Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Why is he still crying? <+++++> Let me hold him for a sec. There.  Huh? There we are.
Come on. I want to know. <+++++> Hmm-Hmm-Hmm.  Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let's talk more about you. Hmm.
Christmas. <+++++> Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?
You or me? <+++++> I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
Your hands are shaking. <+++++> I know, and I can't stop sweating.
Wh-what are we gonna tell him? <+++++> Well, the lighting was okay.
I 'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross. <+++++> Well, I 'm going to take off.  Congratulations man.
You have a son? <+++++> Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I 'm sure you are with your wife!  Oh, I'm sorry!  It's unbelievable!
Professor Geller! <+++++> Yes, professor Feesen-sen- stenlger I 'll be with you in one moment.  So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints.
Well, I have a PhD, so... <+++++> One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis... WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've not finished counting!!
Oh, that is so... <+++++> No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island.
I do love you. <+++++> I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again.
Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep. <+++++> Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
How does going to a strip club help him better? <+++++> Because there are naked ladies there.
Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too! <+++++> Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!
Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya? <+++++> Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead.  Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?
Hey! <+++++> You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!
But more importantly to full well-rounded lives. <+++++> ...that center around work.
Oh yeah? Well thanks. <+++++> So, so now do I get Joey?
That's perfect! That's brilliant! <+++++> So really, what'd ya have?
No. <+++++> Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller.
Wow you, you. I had no idea. <+++++> Really?
Very, very bad. <+++++> I 'm agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?
All right, y 'know what? We really are late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!! <+++++> Fine. You 'll-you'll watch it on video when we get back.
M-m. <+++++> See, there are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated.
How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you slept together last night. <+++++> Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is.
Can I ask you something? <+++++> Uh-huh.
All right. <+++++> Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.
I 'm gonna leave the three of you alone. <+++++> Okay.
Oh, blimey, I still can 't believe you've got an earring! <+++++> Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe?
Wait, no, look at this!    "Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay " Oh, yeah, but it's on the ground floor. <+++++> Hey!
But Ross, its you and me! <+++++> So? Sure! But it-it wouldn 't be anything romantic. And I'm-I'm dating Mona-Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! What is wrong with me?!
Yes! <+++++> I 'm sorry, I meant a blue LeSabre.
I 've got Ben. <+++++> Because, because I 've got Ben.
You got sprayed with two two' s and... <+++++> I'm a four?
What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense! <+++++> And what --What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don't get the annulment. Don't type that! What?! Stop typing!  Hey! Stop typing!  Stop typing! Stop typing!!
It 's so cool man, it's so, it's just 'cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her. <+++++> Yeah, yeah.
That 's not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don't feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding. <+++++> Why not?
Okay, you wore me down. <+++++> Hey Joe, while you 're over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?
Okay.  Did ah, you guys mean you plus one? <+++++> All right, I 'll see you tonight.
Oh, me too. <+++++> Yeah? Well, I-I think Ben 's asleep.
No, I'm not talking about you.  <to Rachel> It was your fat <+++++> Amy. I'm going to save you some time, ok. <spins finger around in circle> All me.
Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol 's great and I'm sure you're a very attractive man, but I . <+++++> No! The reason I 'm asking is that I sorta had one last night.
Oh.. a little.. <+++++> Mm-hmm..
So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not? <+++++> Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he 's so cheap, he'd never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough?
Hit me. <+++++> Joey, give me the bag.
He could be in disguise, y 'know. <+++++> Aw, y 'know Y'know, maybe we're-we're just approaching this all wrong. If you're Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you'd go?
Why?  'Cause otherwise you'd go for it? <+++++> Yeah, maybe.
All the time. In fact, I was undefeated. <+++++> Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.
Yes we are. So, coffee? <+++++> Coffee sounds great.  Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
Oh, I 'm Ross. I'm Ross. I'm too good for the Hut; I'm too good for the Hut. <+++++> Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey, just remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?
What about you honey, who would be on your list? <+++++> Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First, I 'll divide my perspective canidates into catergories....
Okay. Okay! <+++++> Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre please see the front desk? Your car is about to be towed.
Hey, kids... <+++++> Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't. <+++++> No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--
They 're gonna fire you! You can't date a student! It's against the rules. <+++++> Really? Its not just frowned upon?
Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger. <+++++> I dunno, there's just something about...
Really? <+++++> Yeah, why?
Yeah. <+++++> We 're having a baby.
Okay. <+++++> I do. I do. I do.
Okay, I know. Hold on.  Hey Ross? <+++++> Yeah?
But you two were supposed to be together. <+++++> Well, I thought so too, but then she said she 'd marry you.
Oh, put him on! <+++++> Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica.  Oh, I guess he doesn 't feel like talking right now. He's smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.
Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one. <+++++> Really?
Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything! <+++++> Ahh.
Think I better go before mommy starts weeping. <+++++> Buy mommy.
NO, no science camp! <+++++> Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake.
Big fat goalie. <+++++> Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie
Ooh... <+++++> Just the crab cakes.
Yeah, just give me a minute!  Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing. <+++++> What?
What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment? <+++++> Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
I 'm sorry? <+++++> My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin ' babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it. <+++++> Wow! We are pretty good at this!
You can really arrange that? <+++++> You let Rachel come back, and it 's done.
Look, either help me or go. <+++++> Fine. I 'll go.
Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!? <+++++> Yeah, she never misses these conferences!  No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!
I came with Paul! <+++++> Yeah, I recognize the ankles!
Okay, one question. <+++++> Shoot.
So it would just be, me alone? <+++++> Well, Ben would be there.
Or, y 'know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you've got y'know a little of this  goin' on. Wow! I still have it! <+++++> Oh, wait! Wait! Don 't you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you'll get that job!
Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little... <+++++> What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?
That's 'cause you have it. <+++++> That's a good point.
No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special. <+++++> And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi.
All right... <+++++> We think Chandler might be having an affair.
Oh, I'm sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before. <+++++> That's alright. Listen, listen.
Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...? <+++++> Oh, ye-ah!
Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more. <+++++> Really?
Ok, how about this ? <+++++> No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!
Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross! <+++++> Right! Right! I just -I want you to know that I'm going to be there through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctor's appointments, the uh, the Lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment-Although we could probably worry about that 'til after we get married.
What? <+++++> The routine!
Yeah, it 's just something I picked up. <+++++> Cookies and porn, you 're the best mom ever!!
Oh my God, you are so paranoid! <+++++> Am I?!
Did she leave a number? <+++++> Did you see me write one down?
I think we 'd better start again. Ross, repeat after me. I, Ross <+++++> I, Ross
Oh come -look, when I was a kid my dad's company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn 't in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that! <+++++> Hey, guys!
Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's? <+++++> Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's?
Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me. <+++++> Yeah?
Well yeah, but then <+++++> Yeah -No-but-but-but-but! We're just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that's not scary right?
Oh my How much do you weigh Ross?! <+++++> I prefer not to answer that right now, I 'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
What?! Oh my...  Oh my God!! What happened?! <+++++> Well, we believe it originated here.  In the Aroma Room.
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we 'll be supportive like crazy. <+++++> Yeah.
So, you just left? Her place was really that bad? <+++++> You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
Oh, ok. I'm just always afraid that people think I'm just fat with big breasts. <+++++> No, no, I knew .
Oh my God! What did you say? <+++++> Nothing! What do you say to that?
Ross, he's got the remote again. <+++++> Good. Maybe he can switch it back.
I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing! <+++++> Baking it didn't help, huh?
Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter. <+++++> Well, it matters to me.
Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel? You know, we're gonna be all like "oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the cape" and you're gonna be all like "oh, I can't guys, I'll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai" <+++++> Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that.
Tails! <+++++> It 's heads.  Gentlemen, pick your category.
Ross, how about you. What would you give up, sex or food? <+++++> Food.
Ohh, ohh. <+++++> When, when were you... under me?
No! You don 't know the system! There'll be nobody messing with the system! <+++++> By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.
What? What? He 's interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here. <+++++> Oh, please. Sweetie it 's hopeless, okay, I'm just gonna go.
Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants. <+++++> And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants
You got it. <+++++> Okay, see ya later.
Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends. <+++++> I know. I am, I am so sorry.
From the guy in the bar, why didn't I get that message? <+++++> Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you not look there?
Oh I can't... I have seminars all day and I promised Ross I would look at his speech. <+++++> Yeah.
Okay, see now I 'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding. <+++++> I 'm-I'm not kidding. Look I-I, I can't have three failed marriages. I can 't. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
Yes.  Yes! <+++++> One more time,  "Hey, don't you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"
But what?! You figured you 'd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel! <+++++> Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I just  Why don't we just let the machine get that?
Yeah. Hate him. <+++++> We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
Oh, is that against the rules? <+++++> No, but it is frowned upon.
I think it's sexy. <+++++> Sexy?
She 's perfect. <+++++> We 're so lucky.
Howard's the handy man! <+++++> Yes but too me he's just, man.
All right, relax. It 's just a shoe. <+++++> Wooooo!!!!
Oh wait I forgot my wrap. <+++++> What? Oh, okay. Wait here.
Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you 've grown. Y'know? <+++++> I suppose.
Uh-huh. <+++++> Wh-what did he say?!
You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds! <+++++> And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler.
You could say that. <+++++> And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.
When you were in China. <+++++> China.
Hi Ross. <+++++> Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see. .
Oh my God. <+++++> I know, I know. I shouldn't have waited 'till now to say it, but I'm.. That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry, but I'm telling you now. I love you. Do not get on this plane.
Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this? <+++++> There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.
Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married? <+++++> Well, Mon, I was married.
Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose. <+++++> 
Oh y 'know, I didn't think of it that way. You're right. You're right. So, can I ask you a question? <+++++> Yeah.
Yeah! <+++++> Just go for it Chandler.
I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already? <+++++> I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
Well, it 's not a part, no. I'm teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension. <+++++> Come on! That 's great.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
What are you mad at me for?! <+++++> Chandler-
Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened. <+++++> What? What?
I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks! <+++++> Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.
Anything but stew. <+++++> All right so, Chandler, from now on, don 't give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don't turn your back to him.
No, not if their room has two beds! <+++++> I guess...It still seems a little... moonlight boat ride!!
Here 's Frannie. Hmm, won't she be happy to see me? <+++++> Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn 't bring you here so you can ambush her.
Oh no. I feel it isn 't really anybody's business, y'know. <+++++> Exactly. So you didn 't, didn't mention anything to Issac right?
Hey guys! <+++++> Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.
Yeah! <+++++> No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in -No, yeah, okay.
Oh hi! <+++++> Hey uh, well, today 's my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?
Hey! <+++++> Hey, what are you doing?
Yeah. <+++++> Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic.
You said... <+++++> I said ' share ' not ' scare '. Go sit over there! .
Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick? <+++++> No way.
Hey! <+++++> No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done!  Ahh!
Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it 'll still be broken then. <+++++> Rach...
Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean he is a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick! <+++++> But we do!  It's gonna be ok, Rach!
Oh yeah! I've come up with a bunch of ideas! <+++++> Really? Me too!
Used to work with her. Used to! I 'm a relative and I didn't get invited! A blood relative! Blood!! <+++++> Stop saying,  "Blood" to strangers.
Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away. <+++++> You-you-you-you  threw my sandwich away!
I am so glad that you could come over tonight. <+++++> Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure.
Could I be more sorry. <+++++> I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist.  All right Joey, we get it.  I'm sorry.
So Santa's coming? <+++++> Yes! Santa's coming!
Hey. <+++++> Hey. Oh, I 'm sorry, this is Cailin.
I know. <+++++> I don 't think you do.
Guess who? <+++++> Department of Sanitation?
...teen! <+++++> 
Joan? <+++++> Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She 's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
C'mon touch it. <+++++> No.
You were supposed to duck!!! Why didn 't you duck? <+++++> Why don 't we talk about this on the way to the hospital?
Oh no! My new Paolo shoes! <+++++> Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
That is seven days! <+++++> Okay look, I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do this after
You don 't secretly smoke do you? <+++++> No!
Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment! <+++++> Actually, it looks really good.
I screwed up so bad, I told Monica that I would stuff and send all these wedding invitations like weeks ago and I-I <+++++> You didn 't do it?
Good. You? <+++++> Good.
Okay, well that's now the third sign that I should not leave Emma. <+++++> Oh, what were the other two?
It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive. <+++++> What, oh my God. What did you do?
It was really... great! <+++++> Oh, thank you so much!
Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they 're gonna be, be drinkin' and dancin, and we really wanna go! <+++++> Dude, we were good!
Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because -I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me-not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right.   Your decision. <+++++> Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.
The sky 's blue Ross and I had sex yesterday! <+++++> Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well okay -I'm scared for my health!
Can you believe they're still not here? <+++++> I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the chances?
Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now. <+++++> OK.  I'm in my apartment...
Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. <+++++> Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.
Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch. <+++++> Why-why would I care about that?
That 's okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It's not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there's gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like? <+++++> Yeah.
Yeah, that makes sense. <+++++> Over my dead body!
What? You 're leaving?! <+++++> Yes, we have something we have to get to.
She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital. <+++++> Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair!  And it was uneven for weeks! <+++++> And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie!
Well, you got here just in time. I really have to go buddy. <+++++> Oh man.
No, answer his. <+++++> Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she 'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.
Yeah, I'm with Mon. <+++++> Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day? Well, alright, even though he's your super, I'm seizing.
Hey! <+++++> Catch any big fish?
...little playthings with yarn? <+++++> What?
Care to venture a guess? <+++++> May 12th?
Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that? <+++++> I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up. <+++++> Yeah, okay, hold on!   They're not coming on man.
Ross! <+++++> Ben!   I mean, Ben! Ben!
Ahhhh. <+++++> Oh. And how was the date?
Okay ladies, that ends today 's class, and let's remember, let's be safe out there. <+++++> It 's a great class.
Ohh, ohh. <+++++> When, when were you... under me? Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you, uh. . . What?
That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say. <+++++> You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace.
You pushed him! <+++++> Joey, I did not break this! Okay?  That has been broken for a while.
Weekend at Bernie's. <+++++> Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
I don 't see it! <+++++> What? What?!
Hi! Bye! <+++++> Okay, I 'm done with my choices, these are final.
Yeah... for three years. <+++++> Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?
Get the hell out of there, y 'know? <+++++> Emily? Emily? I 'm coming in.
Hey! <+++++> ....I have to go to China.
Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one time -not any more. I just-I... <+++++> Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
And um, excuse me, he helps me. <+++++> Oh-ho please. Ask her how?
Ah?  Do you have one here? <+++++> No.
Why the hell didn't you tell me! <+++++> I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'
Oh. <+++++> Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.
Menstrual cramps. <+++++> I don't think that's what this is.
What? <+++++> Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't give you up.
Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night. <+++++> Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.
Well Ross, you be careful now. You don 't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents. <+++++> Yeah. What-what should I do?
Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs. <+++++> I'd lead with that.
I'm sorry, that's not funny. <+++++> Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where my wife is.   "Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?" Don't know!
He 's sleeping. <+++++> Ahh.  Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
Are you serious? <+++++> I 'm just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?
I know what this is all about... You've always been <+++++> Look, I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your silly
Oh, that's great, that is great! <+++++> Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?
Come on, he's still in the bathroom! I'm begging you! <+++++> Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm...  When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll...
Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food! <+++++> Hey guys!
I uhm... I completely understand. <+++++> Alright, I'm gonna go find them...  I just need a... need a before I can... you know.  Grandma... grandma... grandma...  Okay, I see you later.
It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose. <+++++> What? You forgot fourteen states?
Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this. <+++++> Ah, must 've been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.
Actually, I should get going. <+++++> Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right?
What? <+++++> I love you!
So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money. <+++++> Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I 'll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.
Oh... How are they? <+++++> Lighter than air...  But that's not the point.
I think its Tibidabo. <+++++> Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?!
Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time. <+++++> Alright, okay.
No! Forget her, man! You don 't need her, you don't need that! <+++++> He 's right, what she did was unforgivable.
Wow, that 's in like 20 minutes. You'd better get dressed. <+++++> I am dressed.
Ok, go quick! <+++++> Thank you for a delightful stay.
I got it. <+++++> I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.
You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come. <+++++> Excuse me?
What?! He got to do it at your first wedding! <+++++> Joey, I figured you 'd understand. I mean, I-I've known him a lot longer.
Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied! <+++++> Well...
She 's gonna be fine. Okay, she's in a more difficult position so you're gonna have to push even harder now. Go! Push! <+++++> Go!
Okay. <+++++> Okay.  Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That 's been one heck of a see-saw hasn't it?
Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way. <+++++> Good for you.
What is with you tonight? <+++++> Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world 's worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will! <+++++> All right. All right, I 'll do it.
That 's what I was gonna say. <+++++> Oh nice tan!
Huh ha ha! <+++++> I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.
Hi <+++++> Hey! Hi!
Ooh! Oh! <+++++> No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?
Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today! <+++++> Yay!
Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let 's face it, so far the guy's not lovin' ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner, y'know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer! <+++++> How is that important?
but you did say it <+++++> yes, yes I did. and I will also say what I'm about to say Vis-ÃÂÃÂ -vis the following Phoebe has never had a serious relationship since her. super- serious relationship with. Vicrum.
Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me! <+++++> Please, you're going down!
Hop in.  Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life. <+++++> Damnit!
I'm gonna get the lasagna. <+++++> Hey Rach...
Hey, I went by the photo shop, take a look, here is a mockup of our card. What do you think? <+++++> Huh. Wow, this is great.
Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along. <+++++> You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
What? <+++++> I like your bow.
I'll take this one too  Uh ... Mommy? <+++++> Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel "Mommy" when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...
You didn 't propose to me. Joey did. <+++++> Poor baby, you 're so tired. Rach, I didn't propose to you, Joey didn't propose to you, and Chandler didn't propose to you.
Yeah, I 'm all in love with you and stuff. So could you change my grade? <+++++> No!
Yeah. <+++++> I'm gonna use the cushion.
Thanks. <+++++> There y'go.
We should get over there and see if she's okay.  Just one...second! Score!  Game! Come on. <+++++> Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?! <+++++> Yeah! Oh yeah, you 'll be fine! It-it'll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y'know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won't.
Well, if you don't know I can't help you. <+++++> Well, I don't know.
You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes! <+++++> Hey! Hey, guess what Joey has!
Well, hey! Well...  Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and...  I wanna say Mike?  To Phoebe and Mike! <+++++> Whoo!

Let go! <+++++> No! You let go!
Could you guys help me? <+++++> Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you.
Ohh, Ross, please! <+++++> One more day, seriously/
Come on, you guys are more then that! I mean, you 're gonna get together right? <+++++> I don 't think that we are.
Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me? <+++++> Umm, no. No.
And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know, <+++++> Yeah, maybe not. So what you wanna do?
He hooked up! He hooked up with someone. <+++++> Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!
Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom. <+++++> That bitch!
Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch. <+++++> Then tell him quickly.
And you 're Okay with that? <+++++> Yes. I mean, it 's what we always planned.  And if you have a plan, you should stick to it.  That's why they call them plans.  Hello?  I'm fine.
Well, I took it. <+++++> That's great! So you're staying in New York!
Look, we have enough, just walk away. <+++++> No, but I want...I want the pinecones!
Ok. <+++++> Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
No! He blew us off! <+++++> What?!
You don 't?! <+++++> No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.
Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn 't. I mean if she just died this morning out of respect. <+++++> Yeah. No. No you 're right.
So. <+++++> You look great. I, uh... I hate that.
Really? <+++++> Not you.
Oh it 's all right. I'm guess I'm just done with the whole dating thing. It's one more thing in my life that's suddenly completely different. This is hard. <+++++> Yeah I know.  On the other hand in um, in about seven months you 're gonna have something that you're gonna love more than any guy you've ever gone out with. Just wait. Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger. You have no idea.
Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood. <+++++> Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.
Well I mean, you 're American to start with. You don't even have rugby here. <+++++> Well, we didn 't have freedom here until 1776, either so
You're doing great, you're doing fine. <+++++> Hello!  Oh, sorry.
There was a woman at the...  The stripper?! <+++++> Yeah.
Ohh, I 'm sorry I couldn't think of anymore for Ross! <+++++> Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!
Eh, why don't we start with the beer? <+++++> Okay.  So, um, Phoebe tells me you, ah, you play piano.
You could say <+++++> Ready to go?
Well actually they 're taping tomorrow. I don't really understand why. <+++++> Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.
Ross! <+++++> What?
I know. I know, but y 'know condoms only work like 97% of the time. <+++++> What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!
Wait, now so you joined the gym? <+++++> And that 's funny, why?
You guys, what was the Powerball number again? <+++++> Seven.
No, I let him win -Ross! <+++++> Yeah?
Yeah, yeah I like him a lot. <+++++> Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?
And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant. <+++++> Mmm.
It's OK, it's fine. <+++++> KARL!
Do the claws again. <+++++> Rach. OK, forget, forget the lobsters OK. We're, let's talk, what about us?
No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it. <+++++> Why?
Yay! <+++++> It 's Ben and his Da-Da. Da-Da? Can you say Da-Da? Y'know, you might as well say it because I told your
Ross, hi. It's me. I just got back on the plane. And I just feel awful. That is so not how I wanted things to end with us. It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you, and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... And... And now I'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have said, and I didn't. I mean, I didn't even get to tell you that I love you too. Because of course I do. I love you. I love you. I love you. What am I doing? I love you! Oh, I've gotta see you. I've gotta get off this plane. <+++++> Oh my God!
Awe!  Oh my God! Looks, she 's a little dare-devil! Oh, let me push, can I push? <+++++> Oh, absolutely!
Oh! <+++++> Great. I feel like an idiot.
Look at this. <+++++> Oh, it looks like mom and dad 's house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is Oh my God!!
G'bye, everybody. <+++++> Bye.
My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. <+++++> All right, we'll work it out.
What did you just do? <+++++> Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?
Why did you change it, Ella was so much prettier! <+++++> What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!
No, you have it, really, I don't want it- <+++++> Split it?
Oh I wanted to. <+++++> So we we both wanted to.
See you guys. <+++++> Rachel, lock the door. Lock the door, seriously.
Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine. <+++++> Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?
Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place. <+++++> The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
Forget about it. It's no big deal. <+++++> C'mon! Joey! What is it?
You are asking me to be your wife! <+++++> And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man? <+++++> I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing! <+++++> Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your-  -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
And you know what? We want a rematch. <+++++> Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
No one wanted seconds, right? <+++++> No, no. I-I'm good.
Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash! <+++++> Mona? What are-hi! What are you doing here? I'm, um, supposed to pick you up!
Ross, say something. Anything. <+++++> So you two are..?
Ha-ha! <+++++> They have another guess.
Oh, Bob, get off the guy! <+++++> Oh! What a game, huh?
Oh no! Why not? <+++++> Well it turns out that Ben and Sting 's son do not get along.
Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he 'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal. <+++++> I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
He forgot to leave his grip size! <+++++> He didn't get the goggles!
Wow! <+++++> Yeah!
No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today. <+++++> Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--
Action! <+++++> That tastes like feet!
You're shooting with Althea?! <+++++> Althea is correct.
What? <+++++> I-I'm, I'm having a boy?
With another woman. Have you no control Ross? <+++++> That 's a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes I will be there to to feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want to do all those things.
Okay, but before you go, could you help me first? <+++++> Sure. I 'll help you.
If we broke up, and I lost you... <+++++> Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?
Come on, I mean, you know me, you know... <+++++> Joey.
Always. <+++++> I didn 't get the annulment.
I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say  "get out of my office!" <+++++> Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?
Huh? <+++++> I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay.  There we go, there we go.
I think you know. <+++++> I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so...
I 'm Scott. <+++++> Yeah, okay, Scott!
You're okay there? <+++++> I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
All right are you guys gonna come down? <+++++> Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.
Hey, what kind of puppy do you think I should get? <+++++> Umm, oh, hey, I don 't know. How about a big one?
I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I- <+++++> Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.
Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something. <+++++> What's up?
Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her. <+++++> We were drunk! I would 've married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!
I 'm telling you it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk. <+++++> You 're drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it. <+++++> You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, that's all. <+++++> Okay, okay, see... that... that is the problem. He is too sensitive.
What 's going on? <+++++> Chandler 's gone again!
Chandler 's making his sex face. <+++++> So, you gettin ' tired?
Oh no! Why? <+++++> 'Cause Carol's a lesbian.  And, and I'm not one. And apparently it's not a mix and match situation.
Have to make it stop!! <+++++> No!!!
During this time are you, are you still my best man? <+++++> Nope.
Oh, scotch neat. Ya know, that's Rachel's father's drink. <+++++> Oh, mine too. Isn't that neat, scotch neat. Would you excuse me?
You went out with her?! We had a pact! <+++++> That was in high school! It 's not like it was binding forever.
Good for you. Alrighty, next? <+++++> Hi, um, I'm err,  I'm Ross Geller, and err ah...  ..that's, that's my boy in there, and uh,  this is Carol Willick, and this... is Susan Bunch. Susan is um Carol's, just, com...  ..who's next?
Ohh, brisk tonight. <+++++> Oh man.
Why don 't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first  weighing stuff. <+++++> Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I 'm-I'm 12 years older than she is.
Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we 'd do nothing. <+++++> Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
Actually, it makes us feel that big. <+++++> I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.
Hey Ross! The baby 's kicking! <+++++> What?! It is?!
But you were going to propose? <+++++> No!!
Oh my God! What are you doing here? <+++++> I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.
Stupid balls are in the way. <+++++> Oh well. It probably would 've been the most constructive solution.
An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn 't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty- fruity love story where he played a blind guy! <+++++> Let me see that!  Oh man!
I can 't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad. <+++++> I 'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.
We can 't tell him, you can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff. <+++++> He 's right, even if it's to say something complementary.
Hi! <+++++> You 're never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That's great news right-I mean for them. Right?
Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact. <+++++> Thank you.  All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?
And that 's why, I'm not inviting you in for a drink.  Bye. <+++++> Oh-no-no-no-no .
I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything. <+++++> Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.
You 're thing. You're thing. Y'know? You're the guy who gets divorced. <+++++> Oh yeah!
She is gonna hate me. <+++++> Yeah, well...
Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who. <+++++> Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.
Maybe. <+++++> OH MY GOD!! I didn 't really believe it until you just said it!!
Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle? <+++++> Oh-oh, yeah.
Hold on.  Fill these out, sit over there. <+++++> Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented.
No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please, come on we do not have any of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not have a diaper service! <+++++> It 's funny you should mention diapers.
Cheers! <+++++> Cheers!
Why'd you freak out? <+++++> Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
Oh come on! <+++++> What?
And Ross, if it weren 't for Rachel's rumor I mean no one in high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map! <+++++> As a romancer of the elderly.
I 've got some bad news. <+++++> What?
No one. <+++++> C'mon, what's his name?
What?! What honey? <+++++> What happened?
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone. <+++++> Woooo hoooo!!!
So are you gonna...talk to her? <+++++> Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!
Can't we just ask her to go? <+++++> No, no. She's way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy.
Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better? <+++++> It didn 't.
Great! <+++++> Really? Which one?
What?! <+++++> Are you sure?
Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser? <+++++> Yeah, have a seat.
Oh, I think I see the problem. And I 'm afraid we're gonna have to use a much stronger tool.  Love. <+++++> Oh God!
Was that the cake? <+++++> Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush.
Actually, Alby is the guy I broke up with. <+++++> You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?
Tramp?! <+++++> I 'm sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.
Like a log. <+++++> Us too.
Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?! <+++++> Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody 's stairs!
Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some. <+++++> Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.
Oh, I've got big Valentine's plans! I've got my Chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy! <+++++> Y'know, it's interesting! Most people think that's made with seawater, when in fact-
Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I 'd better go. <+++++> I think that would be best.
That'll teach you to lick my muffin. <+++++> 
I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked. <+++++> That's so sweet.
I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car! <+++++> Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
Art lover! <+++++> What'd you say?
Look! <+++++> Dude! That's my sister!
Say something..... hot. <+++++> Er.... um.....
All right, we 've got to tell her he's gone. <+++++> No! Hey! Hey! We can 't!
I just had the hardest day. Those bags are so heavy. <+++++> Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.
Ow! <+++++> Rach?
I know no, no, y'know you don 't deserve this, you don't Ross. You're, you're really, you're so good. <+++++> Thanks.
Eh, I 'm just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I don't want to get back together over a machine. <+++++> Na-huh.
I never should have broken up with you. I think about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me? <+++++> No!
Okay. <+++++> Okay, I know I 'm not supposed to know, but I do. And I'm so excited for you!
You're welcome. And thank you for "Science Boy". I learned a lot from him <+++++> You're welcome.
I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure. <+++++> I know!
Dysprosium. <+++++> 
Oh-oh, you lie. <+++++> What you don 't think I'd go up to her?
Your kid is seven?!   He's really small.  Please! Please get the tickets! <+++++> Look I 'm sorry Pheebs, I can't do it.
I 'm sorry! It was a reflex! <+++++> Oh my god, this really hurts!!!
Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time. <+++++> Oh yeah, she 's-she's amazing. And-and she's so much fun. And! Y'know what? When I'm with her, I'm fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes.  She's leaving in two days, I don't have to do it.
Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help. <+++++> Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.
I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben! <+++++> What?!
Yeah, well he 's my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it. <+++++> It 's a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
Okay...  ..whose turn is it? <+++++> Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'.
Hey. Oh, I 'm sorry, this is Cailin. <+++++> And! Break!!
Ohh, no. Ugh. Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there. <+++++> I know.
The actress! <+++++> Thanks Rach.
Ohh! Oh my God! <+++++> You like it?
Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making. Listen. <+++++> Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?
That is. <+++++> since I stopped trying.
Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus. <+++++> No, Mike, no, no. You wanna pick me, I mean... watch!  Huh?
Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is! <+++++> I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!
I like it. <+++++> Are you kidding?
Hello. <+++++> Hey!
Alright, I got it Ross. <+++++> You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
Diapers huh? <+++++> Yep.
Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader. <+++++> Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must 've seen me cruising in the bad boy.
Oh! Oh! The usher must be right! What, with all that training they go through! Get out!!  Here!   Hey man, you want the aisle? <+++++> No, I 'm good.
No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate. <+++++> Ohhhhh!
She asked-asked you out again? <+++++> Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine 's Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean.
Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat? <+++++> Come here  Oh! There she is! Hi!
Well, Ross and I were in grad school together. <+++++> But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
None for me. <+++++> Okay sorry, whew.
Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing.  Uh, lie back.. <+++++> You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.
Aww, look at the little thing. <+++++> Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Damn it! <+++++> Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now. Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time.
Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don 't we Ben? <+++++> Okay, I 'll see you later pal.
Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left! <+++++> Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head! You can do it! You can do it!  Okay. You got it?
Blow it. <+++++> Sorry.  'Cause umm, I think this will make you a little more sophisticated.
So what. <+++++> So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money.
You do? <+++++> Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.
Hiccups. <+++++> Rach, I told you, you can't call him every time any little thing comes up.
 <+++++> You gotta hear this story.
Oh! <+++++> We have got to start locking that door!
Wait! No! No! It's my hamster! It's Mitzi! <+++++> Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out.
No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this? <+++++> Yeah, I'm sure.
Congratulations! You just got married! <+++++> I know. Can you believe that?

Hey Toby! Have a good night. <+++++> Did that guy just call you Toby?
Hey thanks. <+++++> So when do you think you 're gonna talk to her?
What?! Ross y'know this isn 't even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too? <+++++> No.
They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right. <+++++> No look I wasn''t right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey.
Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife. <+++++> Soon he 'll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.
Yeah, it 's the new building on Avenue A. <+++++> What?! That-that 's all the way cross town, I'm supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.
Thanks! <+++++> Look, don 't worry about me. Okay? I'll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I'll uh, I'll be that guy right out of the circle.
It 's your mommy. It's your mommy. <+++++> Ohhhh
Y 'know what else makes you wonder? <+++++> Huh?
No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted. <+++++> Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest  But we had our best friend's interest at heart.
Yeah, and y 'know what? I love them both, so why don't you just pick one and that'll be it. <+++++> Wow! Umm, okay uh everyone this is Isabella.  What?
Ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs? <+++++> Oh my God. It's like Sophie's Choice.
Really? Did you count Mississipily? <+++++> Dude, you're not tanned.

Sorry- <+++++> No no no, go-
You are so fired. <+++++> What?
I'm so sorry... <+++++> Is-is he ok?
Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing. <+++++> Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the...
That 's a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three days! <+++++> Yeah! Yeah!  Oh, this will make a great memory.
So.... I quit. <+++++> Why?
Great! <+++++> This is beautiful!
I know! I know, she says it 's all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff.  So come on, she's gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please? <+++++> What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe -Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!
I can still see you! <+++++> All right!!
Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it 's time the velvet ropes came down. <+++++> They kept your room for a while.
So why did you plan a party at the same time? <+++++> No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It 's usually, "Surprise!" And then, "Oh my God, I'm so surprised-good-bye!"
Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to say, and some of it didn't even make any sense. <+++++> What do you mean?
Yeah! Right! Okay, I 'll see you guys later.  Woo hoo! <+++++> You go get  'em.  What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?
Okay, well, we brought you some wine. <+++++> Oh! That is so thoughtful.  She's a keeper. And what did you bring me?
Susan and I live together. <+++++> Although I was married to her.
I mean, that's a typical guy response. <+++++> Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
Okay. Okay, here 's a good one of us. <+++++> Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card y 'know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
I didn 't do it! It was Chandler! He's He's mad at you! <+++++> What?! Why?!
What?! <+++++> To London! Come to London. Please? It 'll mean so much to me.
I am those things, yeah. <+++++> You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...
Oh, yeah. <+++++> Anyway seriously, uh just just talk to the guy, okay? And tell me how it goes.
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less. <+++++> Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt...
Oh shout, that would have been fun. <+++++> Oh look, did, did you just see that? Did you see? He just waved, he just waved, he's never waved before, you've never waved before. Yes he has. Very good.
No, hit me <+++++> Give me the bag.
Thanks. <+++++> And uh, Rachel.
No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there 's other stuff. Here's a nice shirt, look at these nice pants... <+++++> Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.
Hey! Ready to go? <+++++> Oh yeah, let me just finish this.
So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it. <+++++> Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame!  What the hell's going on over here?!?!?  Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time. <+++++> Hey, I've been married 3 times
My parents are going to be really mad. <+++++> Is that -are you saying yes? Is that yes?
Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel! <+++++> No way!
Why? Why do I have to learn? <+++++> Well In-in case of emergency.
Who? Me the attacker? <+++++> Yes that 's right.
Ross. <+++++> Hello, Susan.  Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?
Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It 's uh-Wait!  Did you write this? <+++++> Yes! You 're the person who checked out my book?!
You burn your mouth? <+++++> Cannot feel my tounge.
Okay, all right, give me the mug! I 'll keep the mug. <+++++> No!! Y'know-y'know don 't do me any favours. In fact, where, where's the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm,  Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I'd like that back too. Yes, I do.
I 'll go. <+++++> Fine.
Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really know me that well; it would be weird. <+++++> What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.
No, I mean it's not Geller. <+++++> What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?
Deal! <+++++> Challenge excepted.
Nobody likes change. <+++++> What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting. <+++++> I'm good.
I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked. <+++++> Why does anyone have to be naked?
Ross. <+++++> Yeah.
I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing! <+++++> Monica did it?
We 're not gonna do this, all right? She's just gonna think that we're doin' it. <+++++> Oh, I see, so everybody wins.
I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, I 'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right. <+++++> I can 't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
Huh? <+++++> All right then.
You remember not having sex in high school, right? <+++++> Yeah.
Let 's have Monica decide. <+++++> Yeah!
Okay. Y 'know what? I'd have to say I really don't care for your tone. And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem to-Whoa!  Oh gosh! Whoa! <+++++> What-what?
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Ah! <+++++> Ok, Mom never hit.
Was it like a sneeze only better? <+++++> No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.
All right. <+++++> Okay! Okay! Okay!
Hey... <+++++> Hey!
OK, Ross, listen to me, I am not yours to save. <+++++> But, you are.
Six months? Whoa that 's rough. <+++++> Well, I mean it 's not all bad. I'm learning to appreciate the uh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.
Yes, it 's a highly controversial procedure. <+++++> It 's ridiculous!
Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea. <+++++> Hi, did you order some bananas?
Dr. Oberman. <+++++> ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-
What? <+++++> Bunny!
Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue! <+++++> Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben.
I never had a bike of my own. <+++++> What?!
Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die  <knocks on table>  she'd have to give her up. <+++++> Sure, Monica would have to give her up.
oh it's just you have that look <+++++> Damn super cuts!
Oh no-no-no, you don 't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets. <+++++> Oh, that 's not true! I've got her lots of stuff she never took back.
I 'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren't that great either. <+++++> Try telling my wife that.
Ross! <+++++> Sorry! Sorry! Oh,  there!  Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
Oh!  Wow! <+++++> She didn 't photograph well!
Yeah. <+++++> All right, I just wanted to check.
Well, can't you just have the party when we get back? <+++++> No.
Why? <+++++> I tired attacking two women, did not work.
In Bizarro World!! You broke the code! <+++++> What code?
I got that! <+++++> Oh, we have one too!!
Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here.  Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?! <+++++> Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!
Wow <+++++> Here!
All right, I 'll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that's it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds.  Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all? <+++++> Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y'know I 'm sure that's not gonna happen this time, why don't I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph's.
"Look, this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok?"  "Oh, thank you very much!"  Yeah, I'm going to Vermont... <+++++> Oh, don't worry about it! Just use your travel insurance.
Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are you doing here? <+++++> I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the voice of Underdog!
Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone! <+++++> Wha... what do you mean?
Did I miss it, did I miss it? <+++++> She's not even here yet.
Okay that 's fair. <+++++> All right.
No. <+++++> No?
Could you want her more? <+++++> Who?
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth. <+++++> You got me a cola drink?
Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now! <+++++> Y 'know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don't even care!
No, come on, you know that's not true. <+++++> What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!
If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact  'Homo-sapien', is that why there extinct? <+++++> Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.
IF you hold a spider. <+++++> I know. (Rachel bends down to Emma and Ross looks over his shoulder again,
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break. <+++++> Fine, you 're right. Let's ah, let's take a break,  let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yoghurt, or something..
Come on Ross. We 're sorry. Please tell us what it is. <+++++> Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
Oh good. <+++++> Wow.
Geller! <+++++> Hey, Fun Bobby!
Wha... the next one? <+++++> Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby.

Y 'know, like where are we? Where is this relationship going? <+++++> Hmm
Oh-A. <+++++> No, no, really. You should go. Just go! Go! Go out! Really, the world is your oyster. Kick up the heels. Paint the town red.
It 's possible. You are very loveable, I'd miss you if I broke up with you.  I was just trying to be supportive. <+++++> Then be supportive like a guy.
Hi, good morning lover. I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees. <+++++> Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!
Ross I 'm so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail. <+++++> I don 't care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she's totally freaked out!

Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don 't let her go without a fight! <+++++> All right. All right, I 'm gonna do it!
I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win. <+++++> What?
Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I haven't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one. <+++++> It's alright, it's no big deal.
But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing. <+++++> What?  What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.
Hi.. how was the game? <+++++> Well..
Okay. <+++++> Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!

Dance karate? <+++++> Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport.
You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care? <+++++> That's what it seemed like.
That means a lot to me man. <+++++> Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay?  Rachel!

Well, does that mean that you 're not going to wearing yours? <+++++> What are you kidding? It 's Batman's tux!!

Will you marry me? <+++++> Oh-no. No. No.
In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it. <+++++> Wait, wait,  You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.
Oh great, the pacifiers? <+++++> In the closet.
Dude, step up! I proposed. <+++++> No, you didn 't!
That's it. <+++++> Well, I-I better get to class  Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way, Phoebe?
Thank you soo much for coming on such a short notice. Ladies and gentlemen, I've-I've-I've been practicing medicine for twenty-three years, and I'm stumped. <+++++> Whoa.
Well, the white seems to be untouched.  Uh-oh. <+++++> What?
Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You've got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven't you ever been unemployed? <+++++> Hey, I am not unemployed. I 'm on sabbatical!
Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together. <+++++> Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friend shaking up. Oh, that's great. That's great.
What?! <+++++> Um uh We're-we're just having this baby together but uh, uh that's all.
Doctor Ross Geller. <+++++> Dad dad, please! As I was saying umm, I'm Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh, and I'm the best man. And uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is my little sister. And, she's the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if you'd all please join me in raising a glass to the, the couple we're here to celebrate.  To the Bings.
Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters. <+++++> Ooh, that's great, I love those little guys.
Oh, you're gonna be great! <+++++> Aw, how can you say that? I can't even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?
No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so. <+++++> Freakish.
And we 'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge. <+++++> Ooh! There 's no way to do this without her? 'Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
Oh, and uh, the fabric softener? <+++++> Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.
How are you doing? <+++++> Wait a minute! How-how the hell did you beat us here?
Well, because if one more person says "what a cute little boy" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna! <+++++> I think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? She's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts. Can I get a blue bow?
So how come it took you so long to ask me out? <+++++> Oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?
Ooh... Dr. Geller! <+++++> God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you to call me that.
Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter. <+++++> 
There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright? <+++++> Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'
Hey, the fight 's starting! <+++++> Okay, we 'll be right in.  So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?

Did you not hear me say,  "Du-ude?!" <+++++> And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he- he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you 're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls.
Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. If she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go. <+++++> You really think so?
Where are you going? <+++++> I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?
Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out? <+++++> That 's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
You don't wanna win the lottery? <+++++> Uh...sure I do, and I also wanna be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.
Exactly. <+++++> Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
Y'know what, I can handle it, handle 's my middle name. Actually it's the ah, middle part of my first name. <+++++> All right Pheebs, your cab 's ready.
I mean, we know it 's a bit hasty but, uh, it just feels so right, so <+++++> Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys
Yeah.  Nice try! <+++++> Hello!
How's it going with her? <+++++> Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little  "playing" ourselves.
Oh. <+++++> Hi.
Oh that 's not so bad. <+++++> will be two months
Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year. <+++++> Ohh, Geller 's got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh!  It's the classic struggle between man and- Someone knocked over a lamp.
Take care. <+++++> Bye Ben.
Oh! <+++++> Look at Emma!
Oh hey Ross oh I'm so glad someone's here could you zip me up? <+++++> sure.
Ross, would you just stop it! It 's getting really old. <+++++> I can 't believe no one believes me!
Ohh, honey no problem. Okay. <+++++> Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.
Me too! <+++++> Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y 'know?
All right. <+++++> All right, did you just say all right?
Alright, look, I'll start, OK? <+++++> Joey, please.
That was a good day! <+++++> They're towing your car, they're towing your car!!
Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time. <+++++> Yeah -no, just that last song.
Nothing, I just like to go like this. <+++++> Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said <+++++> Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said,  "Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?"  Yeah, then you did that.
Sorry. <+++++> Here.   At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.
Yeah, by Sandrine. <+++++> You're just saying that 'cause I said no to your name!
Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes. <+++++> Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and you'll see!
If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem. <+++++> Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?
No, I think that was the whole all. <+++++> Okay.
Somebody lose a ring? <+++++> Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much!
So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do? <+++++> Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
We have a half hour. <+++++> No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight.
I was sending you signals? <+++++> Yeah!
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction <+++++> Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
Oh, hello liar. <+++++> Look, I-I 'm really sorry I let go of the bike.
Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently people now call you mental. <+++++> Yeah.
Oh that 's great! <+++++> Yeah.
Hello, Ross? <+++++> Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily!  It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush- shhst!  Hi!
Ross, we can solve this. I just heard your speech. We can recreate it! We've got all night! <+++++> Wha... what you really think we can do that?
No, when you put your feet up in my bed, you tugged on my catheter. <+++++> Ouchy.
We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it 's actually for Joshua.  Look, he said he's not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him! <+++++> Well, as much as I 'd like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren't going to be here. All right? I mean, she's going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I've got a whole special evening planned. So I'm sorry, no party.
You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body! <+++++> Dude!
What!? You faked it? <+++++> You know what? I don't need a tie. I mean, it's better, open collar. You know, it's more casual
Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay. <+++++> What?
Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can 't talk to Rachel. <+++++> What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?
Keep singing! Keep singing! <+++++> Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.
Ross, we can handle this. <+++++> Well, apparently not, and I can 't just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!
Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, "hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck". <+++++> Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or , or I'm the one who dates her. <+++++> That 's interesting, but check this out. I date her
Yeah, sure. <+++++> No, not you.
You didn 't find her? <+++++> No, I 've looked everywhere!
Oh yeah? <+++++> Hey.
 <+++++> WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
Bad dream? <+++++> I wasn 't sleeping.
Whoa whoa whoa! Where 're you goin'? <+++++> Oh, oh, we did say we 'd stop by this little thing Joey's roommate is having.
Well Joey doesn 't like to talk about it but, he's one of the stars of Days Of Our Lives. <+++++> That 's right! That's right, don't you play a woman?
You sat back and let him have her, you didn 't fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily? <+++++> No.
Ross? <+++++> Yeah?
Are you crazy?! <+++++> Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
Grazie. <+++++> Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say...
Fine, just stop thinking about me. <+++++> Can't do it, can you?
Hey! <+++++> What are you doing here, Santa?
Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them. <+++++> You're wrong.
Hey! <+++++> Hey I 'm sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I've got this meeting at school. And- and he-he asked for his uh, 'Fun Aunt' Rachel, so
Yeah. <+++++> A-a-and... record.
Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person... When I left, I said <+++++> Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap.
Fears and Pet Peeves. <+++++> What is Monica 's biggest pet peeve?
Ohh that 's so sweet! <+++++> Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I 'm having a great time! Y'know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it's not. I mean it's not at all.
Maybe I'll just turn the lights down a little. <+++++> How about all the way.
Come on! <+++++> But, okay.
You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand! <+++++> Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?
Oh, just look at her... <+++++> Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...
It's my TV. <+++++> Wha-, oh, quit it.
Oh, no-no, y 'know I absolutely adore Rachel it's just that, well it might be a awkward for you. But it's absolutely your decision.  More tea? <+++++> Yeah sure.
You wanna see her again, right? <+++++> Yeah.
Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I 've got to get this order in. Honey, I'm so sorry, but it looks like I'm gonna be here all night. <+++++> What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?
Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot. <+++++> You know, you know, actually it's getting better. It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone for Thcrabble?
It's Richard Burke. <+++++> Who's Richard Burke? Doc, Doctor Burke? You have a date with Doctor Burke? Why, why, why should that bother me? I, I love that man, he's like a uh, brother to dad.
Close call day. <+++++> Hey, thanks Rach.
I guess. <+++++> I'll do it!
Was that Emma? Is she up? <+++++> No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.
I wish I could. <+++++> Oh no. Don 't, don't, don't start packing. Come on!
Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool? <+++++> No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?
Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white.  Nope. Okay, colors that don't work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple. <+++++> I don't know what I'm going to do. That date starts in like an hour.
Ross, I am a human doodle!! <+++++> Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you. Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here!  There are tons of freaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one will notice, I swear!
I don't think they are. <+++++> Haha! Looks like you're not going to be in the wedding either.  So sorry Pheebs.
Because , because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel  was like,  "You are such an idiot!" <+++++> Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
Yeah, and you don 't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me. <+++++> That 's right good things, that-that is what I said.
Well, why can't you do them tomorrow? <+++++> Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
Would you look at them? <+++++> Yeah, can't help but.
Are there anymore from the good batch?  'Cause we could just work off of those. <+++++> Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh  It's batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way!
Yes!  .... or no. <+++++> Alright.
That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge. <+++++> She said you gave her the razor!
No. Here <+++++> HEY!
Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it? <+++++> Which one?
You did! <+++++> Yes. Yes, yes I did.  But-but it was, it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing.
Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch!   And I 'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse? <+++++> You get the dollhouse.
Yeah, okay. <+++++> Yeah?
I don 't what your talking about. <+++++> Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
I'll do it! <+++++> No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you scared of dogs?
Chandler's wearing panties. <+++++> What? Let me see.
So what. So he drank a lot tonight. <+++++> Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.
No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you. <+++++> Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them.
I'm really sorry you guys. <+++++> Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window.
Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood. <+++++> They 're not a couple!
Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner. <+++++> Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
You 're welcome buddy. <+++++> Yeah, thanks.
Oh, that's what she meant!  You know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion! <+++++> Yeah, most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!
Well, let's see. The first one is <+++++> I know, it's the first time, we're leaving the baby and hey, I know how hard it is for you, but but Emma is gonna be fine. My mom is gonna be with her. She's great with kids.
W-wait. What is that? <+++++> 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
Here?! Now?! <+++++> Well, yeah. I can 't-I can't stay here all night, and if I go in there she's-she's gonna wanna... do stuff.
All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool. <+++++> Yeah, hi, I was just beeped.  No, AndrÃÂÃÂ© is not here.  Third time today.  Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services.
No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about? <+++++> No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.
Yeah well, maybe she should 've spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom. <+++++> Well, I don 't think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that 's just because I am not emotionally unavailable!
Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like,  banging his hands together! <+++++> Okay, fine, fine. You don 't want to believe me? No, that's fine.
I wanna get married <+++++> please don't cry because of me pheebs I don't know what I'm talking about, I've been divorced three times.
Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?! <+++++> Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
Who? <+++++> Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?
Why don 't all of you tell me a little about your self? <+++++> Ah, actually, I 'm sorry we-we probably should get going.
Oh, for god's sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock!  I'm sorry, was that rude? Di- did my, my li-little outburst blunt  the hideousness  that is this evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didn't even have the courtesy to call.  Well, it's too late now. <+++++> Well, ??? think that's us?
What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning! <+++++> Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat. <+++++> Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!
Well, we're not seeing each other, so.... <+++++> Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...
Wow you guys got a hospital? <+++++> No I left the diapers at the hospital! There 's some in the bag but I'll run out and get some more.
A pill? <+++++> Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.
Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either -Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh!  Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it. <+++++> Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
Ross... <+++++> I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!
Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react. <+++++> You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react?
Oh... uh... look... before you... <+++++> No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous...
I know. <+++++> I am so sorry.
Umm, or , maybe, I should stay away from all men. <+++++> No, it 's not just 'cause I'm jealous.  I mean I'm not, I'm not, I'm not jealous, okay? It's Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
Her date tipped me ten dollars. <+++++> Pheebs, what are you doing?
I I uh, actually just moved from four blocks over. <+++++> Ah.
Okay. <+++++> Guess whose middle name is Muriel.
Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a confession to make uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid <+++++> Wh-What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.
No way! <+++++> Way!
Actually about an hour and a half. <+++++> I told you it wasn't long, but there is an amazing connection between us.
No, no! We made this decision together. <+++++> She's putting words in your mouth!
Oh it 's been going on way to long now. Y'know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn't say anything. And then the next time he said, "Hey Toby, do you want a donut?" And I-I wanted a donut. And now it's five years later, the donut's gone and I'm still Toby. <+++++> Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!
Really? About what? <+++++> Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.
What are you talking about? <+++++> Cousin Frannie 's wedding, its tomorrow night.
All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar. <+++++> Ohh.
It's some of Richard's hair!  What do I do with this? <+++++> Getting it away from me would be job one.
No! No-no. Look, there 's a bug stuck in tar right here. <+++++> Joey come -I can't believe-I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of nature's most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
So? Did you get the annulment? <+++++> I couldn 't.
We 'll take Literature!! <+++++> Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey 's apartment. What name appears on the address label?
Ugh. <+++++> Alright, ok, let's do it.  Uhm, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello!  And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic.
...if you tell me, I might do it. <+++++> Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?
Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go.  Y'know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just-I don't get Chandler. Y'know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don't get all upset. <+++++> All the time?
Nothing... <+++++> Seriously... What is it?
Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man. <+++++> Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I uh, you gotta have something.
Then she came back with  "The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?" <+++++> 'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say  "When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"
Please... Chandler is the love of my life... ... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! <+++++> So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?
Yeah, yeah, all the time. <+++++> Really?
It 's not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do  that again. <+++++> Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?
Whoa-ho. <+++++> Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?
And then we've gotta get some sleep. <+++++> Yeah, it's really 6
I got it! Mine! <+++++> Hi.
Rossss can! <+++++> Phoebe, I
Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look. <+++++> So uh, where's Monica?
Are you okay? <+++++> Uh-huh.
Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now? <+++++> Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.
Look I just thought that... <+++++> No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!
Thank you. <+++++> That was very nice Ashley.
Ugh. Come on, Mona, don't kiss ass. <+++++> Uh, I'm going to take off.

Marcel? <+++++> My uncle Marcel.
Okay, now make it even,  'cause we don't... <+++++> What? What?
Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it? <+++++> Oh, I'm sorry, did I say "invest it"? I meant "be cool and piss it all away"
Okay. <+++++> Now, we 'll see.
Okay. <+++++> Thank you!
I think I need a drink. <+++++> Oh, here, I, I'll get it for ya. Whad'ya want?
She is? <+++++> Ya.
Yeah, what's it about? <+++++> Events from around the globe.
Why not? <+++++> Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.
What? <+++++> This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!
Hey, buddy. <+++++> Hi. (He is wearing a piece of steel bandaged to his nose.
Umm, hi! <+++++> Hi.
How long has it been since you had sex? <+++++> Well, last weekend
Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight. <+++++> Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
Yeah? <+++++> Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.
Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat! <+++++> So, why is Erica coming to visit?
Ross, don't press send, don't press se... ! <+++++> oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...
Look, I don't wanna hear this right now. <+++++> Huh, I'm just saying...
I 'm not gonna tell you! You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg. <+++++> Hey now! That was an accident, okay.
All right, so... next time, you take her to your place. <+++++> No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.
Oh, I blew it. I wouldn 't of even hired me. <+++++> Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you 're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job.  That's not how that was supposed to come out.
Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes. <+++++> Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad.
Hey! <+++++> So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?
Ross, she 's 25 years old. <+++++> So what! I still have -No you're probably right.
Wow! <+++++> Yeah. Do you have any idea what this means in academic circles, uh? I am gonna get laid.
Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving. <+++++> You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.
You 're right. It was 37. <+++++> I mean you 're not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are ya?
Any contact? <+++++> She lent me an egg once.
Yeah. <+++++> Oh great!
hmmm... <+++++> I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now.
Interesting. <+++++> I guess!
Call them mom and dad you loser! <+++++> Monica!
Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent. <+++++> Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.
Five dollars a box. <+++++> And what is second prize?
You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan? <+++++> Hey, they 're going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y'know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful-didn't you see Personal Best?
Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone. <+++++> Well, if-if she thought they were on a break
Because I need the money, and I thought that it 'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect. <+++++> Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don't think Mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do.
If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me. <+++++> You were in a porno?
Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I don't even know what department that guy's in. <+++++> So, what are you gonna do?
Can I tell you something? Me too. <+++++> Y 'know what? He didn't want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don't talk to him at all!
Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y 'know, I probably wouldn't have to say spank as much. <+++++> What?
Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they 're gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders. <+++++> Okay, well, we 'll call the company that sent her!
Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let 's talk about it!! How was she? <+++++> She was...
We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go? <+++++> My fajitas!!
Since when, since when do you think I don 't wear enough of this? <+++++> Well I, close your eyes, I just think you 're gonna like this a little better, 'cause, close-close...
Me too. <+++++> Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you?
What?! <+++++> Yep!
Great. <+++++> Hi, honey.
Oooh, I like that, "daddy" <+++++> I ... I was just talking about Rachel.
Okay. Okay. Umm Ooh! Oh-oh, I got something. It's this story I came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; they're like putty. <+++++> Really? Well then tell it to me.
Ye-ye, we go to yours! <+++++> Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it 's my sister. But, uh, uh y'know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.
Ross! <+++++> Great to see you!
Wow! Hey, why are you all dressed up? <+++++> Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn't she look cute?
Yeah. Salt, so your life always has flavor. <+++++> Huh.
We 've only known each other for six weeks! <+++++> Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who 's-who's to say? Does that me we- we can't do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn't it?
Yeah. <+++++> Sure. Yeah.
You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date. <+++++> Hmm-Hmm-Hmm.  Me, neither. I've had a really good time too, you know.
Hey cool, mine too. <+++++> 
Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there 's the added mystery of who gets who. <+++++> Who gets whom.  I don 't know why I do that.
I 'm not sure yet. Why didn't you just tell me about all this? <+++++> Because what 's going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you.
Maybe you do that next time you get married! <+++++> No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset.
Oh my God, she's so stupid! <+++++> Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay.
Oh no thanks. I don 't like any thing from my Scottish heritage. <+++++> What?!
Oh no, I really don 't want any--Oh! Thank you. Oh. Oh Ross <+++++> What?
All right. <+++++> Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
Wow! How are you?! <+++++> Good-good, I 'm-I'm married.
Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before. <+++++> No! No we don 't!
Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him <+++++> Bye.
But your divorce isn't even final yet. <+++++> Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross. <+++++> Fine.
Eh, okay, the waiters have a little pool going. We have a bet on how long it'll take before you give up and go home. <+++++> What? You - you're making money off my misery?
That's very funny. We done now? <+++++> No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt. <+++++> Oh, ah, you don 't need that.
-if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. <+++++> ...As in Mouse?
Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now. <+++++> You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me?
I love it!! <+++++> Yeah?
Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off. <+++++> So, do you get colours or just French tips?
Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose. <+++++> Okay, I'm the baby.
What's it look like? <+++++> Kinda like a big face without skin.
Hel-lo, Rachel Green. <+++++> Mee mee, mee-mee mee.
And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave. <+++++> Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!
So, why did you break up? <+++++> Oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? She... she was... eh... gay.
I don 't think I'd be comfortable with any of my old lovers there. <+++++> Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn 't invite her?
Oh, that is so unfortunate. <+++++> What?
Argh! <+++++> Argh!
Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica 's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks. <+++++> You think?
Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat. <+++++> Yeah.
Well, actually... <+++++> Well, can I talk to you for a sec.?
Here's your lemonade. <+++++> I didn't order lemonade.
Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle. <+++++> Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.
Guess what? You're almost an uncle! <+++++> What?
Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo? <+++++> I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?
Well, maybe you didn 't want it to end? <+++++> What do you mean?
Ooh, I have to go pack.  It really does? <+++++> It does. It really and truly does.
oooh! Oh oh! <+++++> I Know!
Those two only had each other! <+++++> Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
I 'll pick it up for you! <+++++> Thank you.
Alright. Just give me your wallets and there won't be a problem. <+++++> What?
Ross, whose glasses are those? <+++++> Mine.
ah-ha! <+++++> How do you feel about all this?
When Carol was pregnant with Ben <+++++> Mmm?
N-no... uhm... did I buy a falafel from you yesterday? <+++++> Yes, yes, you did.
uhm... Is everything okay? <+++++> Yeah, It's just... I don't think I can do this...
I cannot believe that you didn 't tell me that we are still married!! <+++++> Look I was going to tell you!
Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that?  Especially you! <+++++> Oh, who cares?
Oh great! Thanks Ross, you 're such a good friend! <+++++> Ohh!
Oh my God!! The baby just kicked! <+++++> Ohh!
Can you please, please take care of it for me? <+++++> Alright, but you have to do one sometime.
I 'm sorry, for the last time, why aren't you two together again?  No, I know. I know, because you're not in that place. Which would be fine, except you totally are. <+++++> It 's it's complicated okay?
She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone? <+++++> Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?
Ross! <+++++> Hiiii-Ya!!  I 'm serious! You're not walking out on my sister!
Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can 't work if I'm sick. <+++++> Ohh!
I can tell you work out.  A paleontologist who works out, you 're like Indiana Jones. <+++++> I am like Indiana Jones.
What are you doing here? <+++++> Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I...
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping. <+++++> That's closer.
Yeah. <+++++> Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can 't decide between the two of them. Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's not fun.
Have you guys picked a date yet? <+++++> Oh no, not yet.
All right, I 'm gonna make more margaritas! <+++++> Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?
I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail. <+++++> Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
Mon, Ethan called again. Mon? <+++++> Mon!
Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke. <+++++> Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
Do you want to know? <+++++> No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is!  Or isn't...
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now. <+++++> Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?
Ross? Let 's go. <+++++> Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
Oh good. Now there 'll be someone there who likes my name. <+++++> Yes there will.  Oh guess what, Molly Gilbert you 've just been bumped up to table one. And if it's all right with you I'm gonna take your place at table six-Martin Clickclocken.
I don't know! I don't remember! <+++++> Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?
Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them <+++++> No. No-no. No. What would you do next?
I 'm good except umm, you still owe me a dance. <+++++> Oh that 's right. Well uh, would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?
That's insane! <+++++> Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves.
No! Y 'know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together. <+++++> Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe! <+++++> Joey's not going.
I can 't see it! <+++++> You-you just said that you did!
Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too. <+++++> Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states. <+++++> What? That's impossible.
For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes. <+++++> Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry. <+++++> Thank you.
Good. <+++++> 
No, no, no, I 'm looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And....  What does it matter, what I'm wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor?  Thank you.  We're holding. <+++++> Hi!
Okay! <+++++> Well, I 'm gonna go get these  in some water.
Thank you. <+++++> Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.
G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play? <+++++> Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
Wait a minute. I thought last night was great. <+++++> Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?
Hi! <+++++> Hi!
I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy. <+++++> Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?
Hi you guys! <+++++> Hey, so uhm... How was dinner?
Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go? <+++++> Great! I 'm across the street having sex with her right now. Your story sucks!
Why are you doing this? <+++++> Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I've already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.
I need to talk to you! <+++++> Sure, what 's up?
we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So <+++++> Oh just say it Kyle!
I know!!   Chip? Hi! It 's Monica.  'Kay.  'Kay.  Okay.  Okay, good-bye.  Oh my God, we just had the best conversation!! <+++++> I was just leaving.
But Ross, Ross. What do you, what do you think she's going to say? <+++++> I don't know, but I.. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened. Where - where is my coat?!
Oh Ross, come on. He's happily married. His wife just had twins. <+++++> Should we send something?
Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer. <+++++> I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?
Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy. <+++++> Oh, it's all over everything. Why? Why me?
Yes, absolutely. I'll call him. <+++++> Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know, butter him up? Anything he really likes?
No. <+++++> She's still at dinner?
Bye. <+++++> Bye.
Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer. <+++++> Hey!
The players. <+++++> Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift. <+++++> G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
Thank you. <+++++> Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay.
I love hiking! <+++++> Oh that 's great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo
Oh wow, it's so beautiful... <+++++> Wow, it really is!
Hey. <+++++> How's the maniac?
Fancy guest. <+++++> Two seconds
Hi you guys! <+++++> Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter.
Hey! <+++++> Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think?  This blue suit, or this brown one?
I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember. <+++++> OK. Oh, oh, oh.
So... <+++++> Morning.
Ooh! Y 'know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour. <+++++> Y 'know what
Well, are any of those people here?! <+++++> Oh, no!! No, no!
You were gonna propose to me? <+++++> Uhh No.
Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now. <+++++> Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?
You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here. <+++++> Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat.
I thought... it was wonderful! <+++++> Oh!
OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband. <+++++> 
Oh! <+++++> Yeah! Se vice?
I don 't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break. <+++++> Okay, okay, fine, you 're right. Let's ah, let's take a break,  let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something..
Maaaassapequa, sounds like a magical place. Tell me about Massapequa, is it steep in Native American history? {Transcriber 's Note <+++++> Well, there is an Arby 's in the shape of a tee-pee.
Ohh, yeah. <+++++> Well, is this Hillary your HOT assistant chef Hillary?
I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn 't matter, I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It's so annoying. Does it bug you? <+++++> You bug me.
Yeah. <+++++> Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia.
All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind. <+++++> Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids.
No! They did! <+++++> Yeah, we went shopping!
No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called  "The Days of Our Lives". <+++++> Dude, it's just  "Days of Our Lives"... there's no the.
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has! <+++++> Oh please!   You 're gonna say things now, aren't ya?
Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely. <+++++> Marcel, c'mere, c'mere.  Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be-  Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.
Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits. <+++++> I don't know you guys.
I 'll be back in an hour to check you again. <+++++> Thank you.
Where is Emily? <+++++> Ugh, she 's saying good-bye to her uncle.
Your son. <+++++> No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.
I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake. <+++++> Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!  Hi Bonnie!
Hey! <+++++> Hi!
Ross, get over it! It 's not like she hates you. <+++++> Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y 'know what I think? It's just she-she's weird. Y'know it's because she's a twin. Twins are weird.
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross 's behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back <+++++> Not broad backed!
This could 've been hers! <+++++> Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?
So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together? <+++++> Oh, I'm actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah, she's been away all week visiting her parents, but she'll be cool. I mean, she's been so supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, 'Fossils are my friends.'
Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around. <+++++> Wait a minute... when you guys walked into the Met, did you go to the right?
...Yeah? <+++++> I'm not a nice guy.
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through? <+++++> It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh. <+++++> What, what's that?
Oh, well think of it like this, when you 're 90 <+++++> I know when I 'm 90 she'll be like 80 and it won't seem like such a big difference.
My job! <+++++> Well, so, you-you 'll get a job here! I mean, I'm always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!
That 's a good call. Right. <+++++> No! No! Look -Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!
That you 're a liar. <+++++> No-no-no, that 's great! I'll be there Monday. And thank you again!  Okay.   Umm, that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!
Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on. <+++++> Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?
'Tonight' tonight? <+++++> Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
Huh? <+++++> I 'm-I'm gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!!
You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I. <+++++> Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck?  No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder?
Oh, I-I'm just making a list of people's birthdays. <+++++> Oh, mine's December...
Well okay! <+++++> A lot of other gas smells
I 'm sorry, what? <+++++> When you thought Joey proposed did did you say yes?
Honey, he 's about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn. <+++++> Hi! Hi, I 'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet , woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee?  Or maybe reimburse you for that one?
Huh. <+++++> Yeah in fact, I 'm gonna go call her right now. And I'll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says
Yes it is. <+++++> Well, I'm gonna kiss you.
Sure. <+++++> Yep! Yeah, see this says D-13, and uh
Oh look! A letter from my mom. <+++++> So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?
Exactly. <+++++> Ohh, yeah I already have one.
Yeah that would really be great. <+++++> Yeah.
So you're really okay with this? <+++++> Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!
Nothing, I really wanna know. <+++++> Oh  Well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene
All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape! <+++++> What is it?
Oh, great! Me too. <+++++> I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you 've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground. <+++++> Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
Well then I demand a recount! <+++++> Actually, it wasn 't that close.
It was an amazing night. <+++++> It was. It was an amazing night.
Are you serious? <+++++> I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!
Ross, you should know that my pants are startin ' to come down and I'm not wearing any underwear! <+++++> Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I -Ooh, a quarter!
All right -oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I'd really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there. <+++++> Yeah. Tell ya what, let 's not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!
With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that. <+++++> No.
Not using it right, Joe. <+++++> I 'm gonna go.
The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five. <+++++> Yeah.
Excuse me? Oh yeah? Well, up yours too! <+++++> Who the hell was that?!
All right buddy, way to go! <+++++> Dude, what are you doing?
Are they still looking for us? <+++++> Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores.  You know, we as a group are not the coolest.
Hey, you! <+++++> Hey!
You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time. <+++++> We know you're out there.
Hey! <+++++> What are you doing?
Ross, you need some help? <+++++> From you?  Yes, please!
Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks... <+++++> Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...
Ah! The high road... <+++++> You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there!
Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated. <+++++> Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.
I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting to realize how much I missed her, and I'm gonna need you to break up with her. <+++++> Are you serious?
Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes. <+++++> And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?
Really?! <+++++> Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured,  "Why not?!"
So you're gonna have to do it in the mess! <+++++> Yeah, okay you're right.
Good day for married people huh? <+++++> I 'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more! <+++++> Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.
Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who ever <+++++> OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?
I don 't know. Do-do you have any clothes on? <+++++> Yeah.
Hey. Whaddya doing? <+++++> Oh! Oh, God!
Come on man, you drove all the way up here. <+++++> No, no, really, I 've got to take the car back anyway, I'm spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It's fine, no guilt I promise.
Yeah? Well you look phenomenal. <+++++> Well she should, it was taken ten years ago!
Yeah, I do. <+++++> And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don 't ya?
So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet? <+++++> Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she 'd like to go out again.
Hey! <+++++> Hey!
That was kind of rude! <+++++> Oh, I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps for me.
What? <+++++> I could ask her to live with me!
Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time. <+++++> ...But a man can change.
Licorice? <+++++> Sure!  Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year.
You guys, he's beautiful! <+++++> Oh, thanks, Pheebs!
But, we are. <+++++> Fine. I just need to know that you 're not gonna tell your sister.
Isn't he good? <+++++> Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...
you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?! <+++++> No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding the phrase,  "Get the hell out of my way!"
Oh, I 'm sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me. <+++++> Maybe he 's just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
So? <+++++> So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?
Yeah. You 're right. Hey I-I can do that. <+++++> Yeah.
Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you 're right where you don't want to be! Back together! <+++++> Ehh, I don 't, I don't think so. She's already talked about y'know, dating other guys.
Sooo!! Anyway... <+++++> Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great.  'Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns. <+++++> That sounds great. Same for me.
Okay. <+++++> I mean, there 's no point in spending time with someone if-if it's just fun. It's gotta be, it's gotta be going somewhere right? So where-where is it going?  Ah! That's-that's the real question. And-and the answer is is it's going somewhere fun. Now I-I know what you're thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y'know, but you're-you're not getting any younger. No I mean-No not you, not you, you-you are getting younger. I mean -you-you look like you're getting younger by the second-What's your secret?
That was amazing! <+++++> Excellent, that was excellent.
Oh hey-hey! <+++++> Is everything okay?
Hey, you got one right! <+++++> You're crazy.
NO! <+++++> No?
Okay.  Oh! A coloring book! <+++++> Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn 't shut up. <+++++> I 'm so proud of you.
Hey Phoebe! <+++++> Hi Pheebs!
A dreamless sleep. <+++++> My God, the baby 's kicking. That's great. Although I kinda wish I-I would've been there to feel the kicking for the first time y'know.
Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air. <+++++> Okay.
One Two Three... <+++++> Damnit!
I don 't know. Y'know, they didn't get us anything. <+++++> Thank you!
No, I knew. <+++++> All right.
Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that? <+++++> No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
Again. Y 'know what? I think we all did. <+++++> Hey!
That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night. <+++++> Really.
He's a pretty tough guy to impress. <+++++> Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him.
I don 't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break. <+++++> Okay, okay, fine, you 're right. Let's ah, let's take a break,  let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something..
Hey, look who's up! How do you feel? <+++++> I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.
Yeah. <+++++> Thank you.
Right. No big deal. <+++++> Okay.
Great nap. <+++++> It really was.
No we weren 't! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y 'know, ended up kissing for a bit. <+++++> So that 's two of my wives.
Oh I I think they're funny. <+++++> You have a line down your face.
Hello. <+++++> Hey.  Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?
Well what is it?! <+++++> He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.
Oh, I know... I know it's been really hard for you. <+++++> Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?
That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it! <+++++> I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?
All right, you know Paolo? <+++++> I'm familiar with his work, yes...
My due date is in one week! <+++++> What are you doing up?
Ah yeah -wait a second now! Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that. <+++++> Well sorry, that 's what I do on dates.
The sheep. <+++++> Hey, what you do on your own time...
I know, I hate being left out of things. <+++++> And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it...
Okay. <+++++> Hi Whitney.
Hi! <+++++> That is one good looking man!
Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I didn't not say it. <+++++> Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?
Hi.  Umm, I think there 's something that we really need to talk about. <+++++> I think we do. Why don 't we go inside?  Look uh, I know why you're here.
Umm, honey, look he just came over to.... <+++++> Yeah! Got it!
Hey. <+++++> You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
And! And, they 're gonna have a baby!  And! And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus. <+++++> My God!
Hi! Remember me? <+++++> Hi! Yeah! Tommy 's in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in front of him, I think he's gonna snap.
Dr. Geller, will you dance with me? <+++++> Oh umm, well uh, maybe-maybe later. Right now, I 'm about to dance with this lady.
Hey, hey! <+++++> Hey, you'll never guess what just happened Phoebe and I got mugged!
You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all,  "Once a cheater, always a cheater." <+++++> Umm-hmm.
Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy 's theory. Okay? <+++++> Hey!
Yeah you do! <+++++> Rings?
Come on! You like this woman, right? <+++++> Yeah.
New people. <+++++> What happened to the Disgustingtons?
I know. I 'm sorry. Look, I'll make a deal with you all right? Okay? <+++++> Hmm.
So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight? <+++++> Y 'know what, I don't know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she 's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, "I take thee circus freak." Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right? <+++++> No! No! Of course it didn 't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you
What?! <+++++> We 're still married! Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
Would you like a lollypop? <+++++> You even have to ask?!    He is alive!
...and I was wondering if... you know, maybe one of you guys... <+++++> I'll do it!
No, he said we were holding up the people behind us. <+++++> And you didn't marry him because...?
All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see. <+++++> No. I am not putting on makeup.
Ross, where are you going? <+++++> To talk to Rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the death-cab?
Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you? <+++++> Oh God, no.
I mean I got news for you mister, Emma? <+++++> Well, that 's what I'm here for.  Want me to get that?
You know, actually I'm a little surprised to myself. I mean, Joey is so different from the guys I usually date. I mean, they're all professors, and intellectuals, and paleontologists mostly, you know, very cerebral... <+++++> Yeah, I know the type.
It 'll be great for next weekend. I mean,  it'll be grrreat. <+++++> What 's going on?
No, you know what, it's late, everything's gonna be closed. Why don't we just do it another night? <+++++> No, no, we won't.
Oh my God, what!? <+++++> Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!
You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody. <+++++> There we go. All better.
Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building. <+++++> Ugh, can you believe that guy!
Ross! <+++++> You know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired.
Yeah, yeah. <+++++> Oh, by the way, great service tonight.
Actually, it 's kinda my fault. I-I quit today. <+++++> But work comes first!  Oh hey, but that 's sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?
Actually, I'm kinda happy to be leaving... I just broke up with someeone. <+++++> Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?
Oh-oh! <+++++> Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it?
Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right? <+++++> Oh I a lot of stuff!
 <+++++> What!  You didn 't do anything wrong?!
I don 't know. Could be because I don't feel like standing around all night waiting for some guy who may or may not scream. <+++++> But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream.
Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land. <+++++> I 'm reading your ad.
What are you doing? <+++++> I...reorganized the fridge. See, bottom shelf
You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl. <+++++> No, it wasn't.
Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We know what 's gonna work! It's doctor recommended! <+++++> I 'm sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, I'm dying.
I don 't think you did a very thorough job! <+++++> I dropped him off at Carol 's.  Anyway, it turns out that I'm not going to be able to get those tickets though.
No suds, no save. Ok? <+++++> What's goin' on?
Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers.  Okay, I'm late for work. <+++++> Oh.
You got a little bored? <+++++> A little. Yeah. I made a snack.
All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean... <+++++> Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with it...
You! It 's not like it's a big deal! You-you don't still do it or anything! <+++++> Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
Oh right, uhm, Don? <+++++> Close. Ron.
He 's perfect, he's never been better. <+++++> What 'd you do, take him whaling?
Oh, yes Elizabeth. Ah, 871. <+++++> That 's crap!! Sister Brown Bird.  Good going.
Okay.  But it is officially nighttime. <+++++> Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?
Yeah. <+++++> Thanks.  What photo album was it?
Hi. <+++++> Are you all right?
Ross! <+++++> Hey-hey you came! Man you look incredible! Hot stuff!  Hot stuff?
Hey! <+++++> Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?
Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel 's not in the same place you are. <+++++> If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
We want the last six years back!! <+++++> So do we!! So do we!!  I 'm sorry you had to see that.
Uhhhooo. <+++++> C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them.
Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone? <+++++> Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship.  Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.
Yes. <+++++> Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
Oh? <+++++> "Hey Ross, it's you!"  Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.
No, no, it's just that it's getting late... <+++++> Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.
Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes <+++++> Cigarettes?!!
All right! <+++++> Come on!  Here.
Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I've been looking for you everywhere! <+++++> Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am.
No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!! <+++++> What? What? What?!
I 'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us. <+++++> Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy. <+++++> What's going on?
I'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts... <+++++> So basically all nuts?
We 're gonna pick up the wedding dress then we're gonna have lunch with mom. <+++++> Ah. Joey you 're-you're having lunch with my mom?
Marriage advice? Really?! <+++++> I 'm telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren't these the same flowers?
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25? <+++++> Looks like a fun gang.
No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece. <+++++> Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know - Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?
I'm not mad. <+++++> No.
Oh, I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable? <+++++> Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!
Hey! <+++++> Hi!
Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon? <+++++> Whad'ya mean?
I don 't have ten minutes!! <+++++> What?  Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
Uh-huh! <+++++> And he 's, he's a total stranger?
Joey! You 're doing great! <+++++> Yeah, so far nothing stupid.
So, you know... I have a little time. If you... if you want to... <+++++> Oh...   Ohh... I'd love to but I really have to grade these papers.
Do you all promise? <+++++> Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!
Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice! <+++++> That's, that's nice twice!
God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was... <+++++> Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?
Well, that's what we said about Joey... <+++++> Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
What kinda noise? <+++++> Just a high pitched intimidating noise.
We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this <+++++> That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
M-M-Mole people? <+++++> What? No-no, a lurker.
And anyhow, I 'm sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to understand that I  still look at Lizzie like she's a twelve-year-old girl. <+++++> Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.
Yeah! I 'm gonna have a boyfriend, you're gonna have a girlfriend <+++++> Ohh! That would be great.
Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying. <+++++> Oh, man, I'm not going to be able to handle this.  Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.
Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. <+++++> Okay, sure.
I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it. <+++++> Hey guys!
Oh, hi. I'm professor Wealer. <+++++> Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice.
Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle. <+++++> Joey!
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone. <+++++> Oh good, you scared me for a minute.
"Big guy?" <+++++> It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
So, did you two have fun? <+++++> Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny...
Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong. <+++++> Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized
I feel like I owe you an explanation. I don't ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. I'm... well, I'm kind of embarrassed. I really hope you don't think less of me. <+++++> Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.
She 's okay with Rachel and the baby? <+++++> Well I I haven't actually told her yet. I don't want to scare her off, y'know?
Okay fine, now Ross <+++++> Oh, but-but I can 't do it.
